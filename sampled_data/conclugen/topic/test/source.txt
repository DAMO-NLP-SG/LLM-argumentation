<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I will start by saying I have travelled to over 30 countries across Europe, North America, East Asia, South East Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. I live in a country I was not born in, and hope to eventually die here too. My parents, sibling, relatives, friends, acquiescences and work colleagues all place immense value in travelling to as many countries as they can, before they become infirm and too old to fly by plane. Their FB and IG feeds attests to this. Out of loyalty to my relatives and friends, I go with them on holiday abroad every year, or even twice. Often a new country, sometimes a destination of my choosing. The truth is, and I will never admit to them, I absolutely despise going on holiday, and I'm deeply suspicious of people who make their love of travel, a central part of their personality. When I'm reminded of a holiday I have undertaken, triggered by a conversation topic or seeing an old photo, no emotions of the places are elicited in me whatsoever. Except perhaps the reminder of the frustrations that inevitably come with travelling by plane. The Sagrada Familia is just a fancy looking church to me. The Angkor Wat felt so much smaller, and less significant up close than when I read about it. San Francisco wasn't overrun by pissing and shitting vagabonds, as Reddit would like me to believe, but the city's charm was largely lost on me. I'm no foodie, eating authentic cuisines means little to me, sushi in Japan was certainly better than anywhere I can find in London, but I don't pine for it. Pizzas, pastas and gelato weren't even better in Italy, just different. My positive memories aren't things I've seen, eaten, walked through, explored, touched or smelt. My positive memories abroad almost always involved the people I travel with and care about. I already get their company back at home. And little actually to do with where I am. When left on my own devices, I much prefer to stay in my hotel room drinking tea and reading my kindle. When I do ask people why they love to travel so much, I only get the same cliche answers the food, the sights, the climate, immersing oneself in a foreign culture this last one can come across patronising, in honesty . When I ask them if they learnt anything from the experience, or had it changed them for the better, I get even less convincing answers, if any. To broaden my horizons is one, but the fact you went in the first place already suggests you were well up for opening your minds anyway. I do not imply that people who enjoy travelling are boring. No. But too many people I've met certainly put this front and centre as their most interesting attribute, naming all the cities they visited as some sort of accomplishment. I love to travel tells me as much about someone who says they watch Netflix, play video games, loves walking and listening to music. I can already anticipate some of the replies I honestly don't think I'm too boring, I have so many different hobbies and varied interests, I don't have all the time in the world to fully invest myself in each. I'm not so closed minded of different cultures, I live and enjoy working in one of the most multicultural cities in the world, and teaching myself to speak two languages. I find it easy to find something in almost anyone interesting, and worth talking about. I can hold a conversation about them, until we both exhaust ourselves. But if they want to just talk about their gap year backpacking trip to Thailand, I simply cannot relate to them on an emotional level. That subject, and cars, are probably the only two I cannot maintain much enthusiasm in. I wasn't sure where I wanted to put this post, could have been r unpopularopinion, r rant, or r offmychests. But I decided to post here, because I honestly would like to understand why you might enjoy it so much? What is it about it that excites you, the subject makes me feel like an alien. I do feel an little bad about myself for not enjoying something most intelligent and well rounded people would.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Let me preface by saying that the point of my my argument is not to say that there is no God. My argument is that some of the most common and basic traits of God logically cannot coexist. So, what are the characteristic are we using? God is The creator of our universe and possibly others Omnipotent Omniscient Omnibenevolent NOTE This is not to say that everyone defines God this way, but these are certainly very common characteristics to God Now let's get in to the basis for my argument. We first need to define the two terms I believe are contradictory omnipotent and omniscient Both the Oxford Merriam Webster dictionaries define omnipotence as having unlimited power . If God is omnipotent then he has no limits to what he she it can do. Omniscient is define by Oxford and Merriam Webster as knowing everything and having infinite awareness, understanding, and insight respectively. As an omniscient being God knows everything that has happened, is happening, and ever will happen. I don't think that either of these definitions and implications are highly disputed. If we take both of these to be true, however, a problem arises. God's omnipotence is limited by his own omniscience. This seems an ambitious claim, but consider the following scenario. God knows that in exactly thirty minutes he will raise his right hand. Because he is omniscient, he knows for certain that his right hand will be raise. This is a problem because it now means that God is limited to doing that specific action at that specific time. He is not able to to raise his left hand rather than his right because that would contradict his own knowledge that he would in fact raise his right hand. Similarly, every action he takes has already been seen by God. He cannot choose to deviate from any action that he has already foreseen. Thus every single one of his actions limited by is omniscience. If omnipotence is having unlimited power then God simply cannot be if he is truly omniscient. Again, the purpose of this CMV is not about the existence of God in general, but the existence of a God with the aforementioned characteristics. Tl dr God can't do anything he doesn't already know he's going to do<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Almost no one else I know stores eggs in the refrigerator, and yet none of them seem to be able to give me a good answer as to why that is the case. Before now, people have said 'the eggs absorb the smells in the fridge', as chefs have apparently said something to that effect on TV. I have never seen or tasted any evidence of this fact however. They've also argued that because supermarkets don't put the eggs in refrigerators, that they obviously shouldn't go there. However, I'm of the mind that they sell quick enough that they don't need to. In my experience refrigerating eggs keeps them fresh for longer and doesn't change the taste. So is there any real argument for keeping them out of the refrigerator? I would like to know, so pleeeease CMV EDIT To clarify, limited refrigerator space is a good argument for keeping eggs out, however I know plenty of people do it despite having plenty of room in the refrigerator Also, I live in the UK, so eggs do not get washed before getting into the supermarket.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I just had a baby boy on Friday so this is weighing on my mind. We know that the west looks down on vaginal mutilation. In fact a couple doctors got charged for a vaginal mutilation scheme several months ago. And for good reason too. It's an unnecessary and tortuous procedure. It's also illegal, even though it's only done for religious reasons. Unlike circumcision, which is legal. And is only popular due to religions reasons. Ya know, gentiles and the Hebrews and all that. My doctor made it very clear there were no health benefits to this procedure other than it helps make things easier to clean. But my wife wants to do it anyway because it's normal. Which in and of itself is a can of worms, because id argue that what nature intended is what's normal. Not what a bunch of people do to their babies due to outdated reasoning and logic. Thankfully in some parts of the US this is changing and the procedure is on the decline. However it's still a huge thing and it's done all the time.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Ever since I was young, I've been terrified at the idea of death. I've thought about it in numerous different ways, and although I currently identify as agnostic, not believing in afterlife, every possible outcome after dying terrifies me deeply. The reason for which i go as far as to say that it isn't possible to be at peace with death is a result of the nature of death. The point of view of somebody who does not believe in afterlife is the most horrifying. After you die, that's it. Your brain ceases to function, and your consciousness being tied to your brain disappears. Forever. You will cease to exist for the rest of eternity. As a human, I'm already unable to grasp the concept of eternity an eternity where i do not exist is horrifying to me. Afterlife doesn't make the outcome much less grim in my opinion. Although it seems paradoxical, the concept of eternal consciousness christian islam heaven hell terrifies me almost as much. The first few thousand years would be wonderful, perhaps even the first million or billion. However eternity is eternity, and soon everything that could possibly be done seen has passed. I would be suffering in eternal boredom and lack of stimulation. Reincarnation is the least scary, but still horrifying. The premise of becoming a new conscience is attractive. However, what happens after you become every conscience, having lived through every life the universe has to offer. What are we left with. Although the beginning is comforting, we are eventually left with the eternities offered in the first two possibilities. I can understand that people can be and are at peace with the concept of their own mortality. However, I do not think I can ever be, and I do not think it is possible to do so unless one does not fully understand the implications of death or has a radically different take on it. Can you change my view? Edit Because I've been getting similar responses. Here are some answers to them. The experience of not being born was the same as your death and it didn't inconvenience you, why should death? Because the two are fundamentally different. Before I was born, I did had not existed, whereas after death I will have existed and stopped existing. As a living creature, not being suicidal, I am filled with desire to keep living. Furthermore, not being born was not eternal, and at most it was from the Big Bang until now. Non existence after death is perpetual an eternity where I do not exist after having done so. This is what terrifies me. <|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>A few basic things first I am solely talking about mindfulness as discussed in a Western, non spiritual context. I am not at all educated about aspects in Buddhist or Hindu religions, except to just know that it involves complicated philosophy of mind I barely understand. That said, I am fairly well educated about it in the Western context many of my colleagues are social psychologists who directly study its effects on well being. Where I'm starting here is the idea that mindfulness contains two aspects a non judgmental accepting perspective, and a focus on the present moment. My issue is These two goals are contradictory unless you happen to already be focusing on the present moment. If I'm ruminating, why would I stop ruminating unless I have a negative judgment towards my own rumination? Consider a fairly traditional mindfulness meditation exercise Focusing on my breath. First of all, why would I choose to focus on my breath unless I'm judging it to be correct or positive? And if my mind wanders or I get caught up in my thoughts, how can I non judgmentally decide to stop doing that? Deciding to alter my behavior implies a judgment that my current behavior is wrong in some way. I'm not discounting the benefits to well being and health found to be associated with mindfulness, but I don't think people can possibly be doing what they think they're doing.<|CONCLUSION|>

Globalisation has changed forever how war affects countries, so now each country depends on each other for essential trade, supplying food, oil and or produce. this means that war has changed forever, as we are beginning to recognise as countries that we are part of a global community, and harming one part affects the whole. Also, not having nukes does not mean you will immediately be invaded. Take a look at Japan, or Finland. Each is a country with a relatively small army and no nukes, that is neighbouring on a large, agressive nuclear state. Neither has seen any conflict on that border since ww2. Nuclear weapons are expensive and provide no definite protection, in my opinion.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I've been a huge fan of NBA basketball nearly all my life. While I have a team that I root for, I love watching greatness come from anyone. That being said, I feel that LeBron has to be the GOAT. As my first point, I should acknowledge that I'm going off the assumption that if LeBron isn't the GOAT, Michael Jordan is though if you can CMV in favor of anyone else, that'd be awesome . So let's compare the two. These stats are from WikiPedia via basketball reference.com LeBron for his career currently averages over 27 ppg, over 7 rpg, and over 7 apg. MJ averaged about 30 ppg, over 6 rpg, and over 5 apg. Michael beats LBJ in ppg, but LeBron leads him by a lot in the other two areas. It should also be noted that while MJ did have more ppg, his field goal percentage and three point percentage were both below LeBron's. The only people who come close to LeBron's career stats are Larry Bird and Magic. LeBron also has by far the best plus minus stats in NBA history. His BPM box plus minus, which can be read about at is wayyy above MJ's, despite MJ still being at number two. Statistically, if any team could choose to put any NBA player, past or present, on the floor, their team would perform the best if that person was LeBron James. Take this evidence as an example in the 92 93 NBA season, Jordan and the Bulls went 57 25. MJ leaves the next season, and the 93 94 Bulls go 55 27, a marginal difference from the previous season. In comparison, LBJ and the 09 10 Cavaliers went 61 21. LeBron leaves the next season, and the Cavs go 19 63. LeBron carries and makes the whole team perform at their peak, and while MJ does that to an extent as well, remove him from the team, and despite the lack of a ring from that season, the performance hardly drops at all. Defense wise, I also think LeBron stands up to MJ. While MJ has more defensive accolades 1 DPOY, 9x all NBA first team defense , I feel that LeBron is a more valuable defender to have, purely based on his ability to guard every player on the floor phenomenally. Some of Cleveland's best playoff moments this season came when LeBron was holding down the defense at the 5 position. The main crux of my argument comes from a comparison of the NBA today vs the NBA of the 80s 90s. The players of the modern day NBA are, in my opinion, by far the best they've ever been for more on this, try this article LeBron manages to put up better stats than MJ while doing so in a tougher league. I find this also to be a fair criticism of the argument that MJ is the GOAT because he was a six time NBA champion. There was a recent article I read about the ELO ratings of NBA finals teams that either MJ or LBJ played against for the data, use this link to the r NBA page and for more on ELO ratings, check out this explanation from FiveThirtyEight LBJ faced significantly better teams than MJ did in the NBA finals. The worst team LBJ ever played in the finals has an ELO rating about equal to the average team MJ played. While Michael is obviously a legend for getting two threepeats, frankly, I think that if you put him and his championship team up against any of the Warriors teams from the past three years, they would struggle just as much as the Cavs. Meanwhile, put LBJ and the Cavs against the teams MJ faced, and I think LeBron has six rings. Obviously, none of that can be proven though. When it comes down to it, it seems to me that LeBron is better than MJ in nearly every aspect of the game he's just had to play in a league that's significantly more talented than the league of Jordan. Some people, however, would say that this is irrelevant the argument is that Michael is still the GOAT because he performed at his peak for the league he was in. He was clutch, and the six titles are proof of that. LeBron is 3 for 7 for the finals, and even if that's in a much harder league, to be the GOAT, you have to rise to the occasion, which Michael did. I think this is definitely a fair argument. I'd counter, however, that if that's our measure for analysis performing at the highest level on whatever stage you happen to be on then MJ still isn't the GOAT. By that statistic, why not someone like Bill Russell, who had 11 championship wins? He performed and got rings. My logic is that since almost no one talks about Bill Russell as the GOAT, we can't really be buying into the idea that the overall skill level of the league a player's in doesn't matter. It seems obvious to us that Michael is a better player than Bill Russell, because even if he had fewer rings, he played in a league that was much more developed than Bill's. If we use that analysis there, we should use it just as much when we compare LBJ and Michael. So, at the end of the day, it seems to me that LeBron James is or, at the end of his career, will be the greatest player of all time. In both individual stats and team stats, LeBron has the slight edge, without even factoring in the difficulty of the league that he's in. In my eyes, only reason for MJ to be the GOAT is that sort of non quantifiable wow factor his clutchness, his attitude, rising to the occasion, and overall superstar aura that he exudes with his two threepeats. While I can't ever disprove that argument, or pretend that LeBron will have that same aura, I think it's time we start thinking about the GOAT status in a different way. Instead of making someone the GOAT because of the general sense of awe associated with them, let's do it because that person truly is the greatest person to ever play basketball, the overall most talented in every area of the game. And, when you look at all the evidence presented, I feel that that person is King James. But, as I stated, I love and respect greatness in any form. I'm ready to hear why the GOAT isn't LeBron, but Michael, or Bill Russell, or Kareem, or Magic or anyone. So go ahead Reddit, CMV<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>To start, I'm Canadian and this stuff doesn't affect me directly so maybe I'm just missing something here. I usually fall under the Democrat Liberal Socialist umbrella and my views generally align with theirs. Recently though I can't comprehend the stupidity coming out of US democratic congress members' mouths. If they succeed in starting impeachment proceedings in the house, which would likely be simple enough considering it just requires a simple majority which they'll have next month, it would then have to go through the Senate where it needs 66 votes, and I don't think they can get anywhere close to the Republican votes required anytime soon. The lame duck Republican power grabs in NC and Wisconsin really drives this point home, and to me, it shows that Republicans are desperately holding on til the bitter end. It's very unlikely that the GOP will have a crisis of identity and wake up while Trump is still in office. Anyways, let's say they do somehow have the Senate votes, and Trump is impeached we are left with Mike Pence, who's first action after taking the oath would almost certainly be a full pardon for Donald Trump and his family so that america can heal and move on . Mike Pence is definitely worse than Trump for Democrats and the liberal agenda, especially when it comes to social issues and women's health. At the same time, he will undoubtedly have more credibility and self control than Trump. There will be no unhinged twitter rants, no hush payments, and the only scandals in the media would revolve around his extreme religious views, his policies that will mirror those views, and any executive order he signs. Shit would get real serious, real fast. The GOP will then have almost 2 years to distance themselves from Trump, which would improve their chances in 2020 drastically. Now let's go through what would happen if impeachment fails in the Senate. it would galvanize Trump's base, and further, validate their claims of a witch hunt. It would be a huge win for all of them. it would be an even bigger loss for Democrats because impeachment is the most grandiose weapon in their arsenal. Donald Trump will feel vindicated and empowered. He might be more inclined to take increasingly drastic actions, like ending the special counsel investigation. it might make it harder for any other GOP candidate to go against him in 2020 the country will be even more divided Am I missing something? To me the only logical action for Democrats to take, is to shut the fuck up about impeachment, cut down the number of candidates who will run in 2020 which will probably be the most diluted shitshow of a DNC primary pool in recent history focus on and build a more concrete agenda, stop with the grandstanding political theater bullshit,keep their heads up and don't stoop to the GOPs level looking at you Maxine Waters , and do everything possible to vote him out in 2020. It is the only path I see towards him potentially being held accountable for his actions and the damage he's caused to your country, because of this 5 year statute of limitations shit that he wouldn't have to deal with if he gets re elected, and because of the guaranteed pardon he would receive if he's impeached or forced to resign. So yeah other than the fact that it would probably feel really good for a while to see Trump kicked out or forced to resign, is there any valid argument that shows impeachment as a smart viable option? I want to believe, I really do. <|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Soundtrack for this CMV post EDIT Please do not downvote CMV posts. If you disagree with the premise of the belief, you are free to respond in the comments and explain your opinion. Most societies throughout history have had histories of racism and cultural marginalisation of minorities. The tribalism of seeing people who look different than us as being an 'other' has strong evolutionary and cultural roots. So, it makes sense that in our modern societies, with fairly recent examples of incredible marginalisation slavery, in the US, for example, or the marginalization of aboriginals in Canada that these pervasive undertones still live on. Luckily, we have had tremendous amount of progress, but while there are people who like to dismiss racism and claim the majority of it is 'over', that is unfortunately far from the case. The word 'racist' drags behind it a huge negative stigma. I think that is unfortunate, as people are unwilling to admit to racism out of fear of being labeled a 'racist' which is the societal equivalent of the boogeyman especially among people who like to think of themselves as 'progressive', 'liberal', or 'open minded'. So instead of owning up to what our behaviors are, we try to think of other words to describe them, or try to logically justify them, or underplay them. For example, it's hard to admit to the racism which we think isn't overt It's not like we're doing hate crimes or overtly malicious. Things that are more in our subconscious, but are still racism. like not being attracted to certain races, etc Especially when we live in a diverse society, and interact with people of many other races, have diverse friends, it's easy to think Hey I'm not racist . But it's the deeper subconscious biases that we don't acknowledge that are racist, too. Afterall, admitting it is not an easy thing to do But the fact is, everyone's a little bit racist.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Now bear with me, religious groups coming to your door to sell you their ideology is annoying, I can admit, but if I honestly believed that everyone that didn't comply with my religion went to hell for example , then it would be very immoral for me NOT to go around telling people this. Thus by telling someone not to push their opinion on someone else, you're supporting immorality. So constantly having someone at your door would be a terrible nuisance, but morally it would be worth these people caring enough to try and help you. The issue here is the opinion that people have, not that they talk about it. The solution isn't to stop people from pushing their views, it's to educate them. This assumes three things, They honestly believe their opinion They believe it's a good thing to help others They believe they might persuade you Of course this applies to things other than religion and to places other than at your door. In general though when people say, I'm fine with , I just wish you wouldn't force your views on others. That means I don't share your view, but I don't want to debate this, so we just won't talk about it. Now reddit loves to bash vegetarians that spout their dietary decisions everywhere. And vegetarian is something a lot of people aren't, but also a lot of people consider more moral. If random guy Bob could be vegetarian and still eat meat, he probably would be. save that argument for another time If this is the case, then either Bob here should come to terms by saying I have no moral qualms with my diet , or he should decide to become a vegetarian. But telling someone not to press their views and then subsequently discuss it leads to a self indulgent vagueness of morals where you don't have to decide if what you do is right or wrong. Allowing people to press their views means discussion, good morals, breaking social stigma and if someone is convinced at the end either one less annoying opinion pusher, or one more person with a good opinion. Assuming the prevailing side is the side with the best opinion. CMV. Edit my view has been changed to the point that I think I'm fine with your opinion, just don't force it onto others is a reasonable stance the catch being that it's often disguised as something reasonable, yet used as a cop out. E.G. Bob's view is everyone has to love everyone. I'm fine with Bob's view, just don't push it on others. Well then you're not fine with his view, because it involves pushing it on others.<|CONCLUSION|>

I've studied the story of the Latin American countries it hasn't been uncommon from them to engage in several debt crises, followed by defaults and hyperinflation. Just take a look at Venezuela, Argentina, Mexico or Ecuador which is now dollarized . Millions of people have seen their savings wiped out by inflation in a couple of years. In fact, I'd argue that my savings right now are being eroded banks are paying a measly 1.6 of interest per year, inflation is around 5 6 and the local stock market has been stagnant for the past years. What's worse, every time there is a crisis ANYWHERE in the world, investors flee from developing countries to hard currencies USD, EUR, GBP, CHF and cause my currency to crash.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>EDIT When I said forgive , I meant forgiving and continuing the relationship. I've looked up similar posts and still don't understand the argument for cheating. I noticed that cheating has been normalized in the media and in real life. People have straight up told me to expect to be cheated on because men are like mindless animals that lack self control, which I won't believe so please don't use this argument. It's sexist if you ask me. Let me first define cheating. Cheating is telling your partner you won't be having a sexual or romantic relationship outside your relationship, but still doing it. It's not considered cheating to me if it's an open relationship or you were forced with violence and whatnot. Also, when talking of relationships, I mean mutual relationships that have or had love in them. I don't want to hear of forced marriages, abusive relationships, or bad arranged marriages cause those have a very different dynamic from what I'm thinking about. If the passion has died in your relationship, it is better to break off the relationship. I don't mean divorce though cause I know that involves money and can be messy, but people can acknowledge the death of a relationship and separate at least. To me, if you cheat that means you don't love your SO. If you really love your SO and understand the pain it would cause them, you wouldn't consider cheating. It's a horrible thing to do and serial cheaters come off as sociopaths. If your SO is having problems sexually and you cheat, that's basically showing that sexual satisfaction was more important than the emotional bond you shared. There's also many ways to attempt to resolve this issue. And if it's that big of a deal and unsolvable, you can move on to an open relationship or separate break up. Cheating is a form of emotional abuse and forgiving it and getting back together is pretty naive. They say they won't do it again until they are doing it again except this abuse is more covert. People who take back those who cheat come off as extremely desperate for the financial benefits in the relationship and or the emotional support they felt in the relationship. I feel when people take back people who cheat, it's because they don't feel they'll ever find anyone to replace what they had which can be a valid point, but still sad desperate . IMO I feel it's a better bet to live the rest of your life without a cheater than with someone who will disrespect your emotions like that. I feel this all makes perfect sense, but it's like the older I get the more people are acting like I'm living in fantasy land. Beautiful independent women are taking back horrible men after cheating with multiple women. Great men are taking back women who cheat too. What's going on?<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Hundreds of years ago, Native Americans were oppressed and driven out of their land by Whites. I feel bad for those who were oppressed. However, I other Americans don't owe them anything, nor should I other Americans be expected to help them just because of what happened 200 years ago. Modern Native Americans haven't gone through any of the pain of their ancestors, so they shouldn't be compensated for it. Modern Whites haven't driven Native Americans off their land, so they shouldn't be responsible for it. The same thing applies to similar situations, like Americans and Japanese for concentration camps during WWII , Germans and Jews, etc. NOTE When I say ancestors, I mean people that lived so long ago that nobody alive today knew them.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>During the Cold War, conservatives of all sorts were ideologically opposed to Communism and found the physical threat of the conventional and nuclear arsenals of the Soviet Union and China as useful scapegoats on rhetoric against more liberal values. Social Conservatives pointed to the lack of religion and conservative family values in the atheistic states of the Soviet Union and China. Free Market Capitalists greatly used the Red Scare into their advantage to eliminate the power of unions, workers rights, and more government regulation. And finally war hawks saw Communism as the reason for increased military spending on intervention. Those who often opposed the right or fought for more progressive ideals were labeled communists, communist sympathizers, atheists, and other terms. Now in the 21st century, instead of Communism, Islam is the new enemy commonly used in talking points. Sharia sympathizers, SJWs, feminazis, or globalists are now terms commonly thrown on the left. Back when social conservatives said communism would ruin the family values, religion, and culture of the United States. Now Islam is that threat, bringing multiculturalism, a different religion, and immigration. Labeling people are SJWs and pro sharia are a way for them to continue to enact their conservative social policy. Economic populist elements of conservatism now has a target to rail against the globalists and immigrants for troubling economic times. And of course with the endless turmoil in the middle east, threats of Iran, increased military spending to secure our borders and to rebuild our military is another excuse to continue the existence of the military industrial complex. Edit I should note I loosely hold this view, however I do see alot of parallels between the rhetoric used during the Cold War and presently now. Please note I understand most of the submission I posted is really a narrative, but it sets the scene. <|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I live in Seattle, which is known for being one the top cities for bicycles. I also see stories of bicyclists getting killed or injured on a regular basis when the either hit or are hit by motorists. My point is not to debate the fault of any particular accident, as I'm fairly sure we could find plenty of instances of fault for both motorists and cyclists. My concern is the way that cyclists are allowed to behave on roads. I'll break into each of the specific points I mentioned in the title Minimum Speed If I was in a car or on a motorcycle, I am required to travel at a certain rate of speed, because if I don't, I'm a danger and an obstacle to the traffic on the road. Cyclists who ride on a public road at half the proper speed limit present the same danger. Lane Splitting In every state except California to the best of my knowledge , lane splitting is illegal, and understandably so. Taking a motorcycle in between cars stopped in traffic is not safe, especially done at any kind of real speed. Doing so on a bicycle is just as dangerous and more so under some circumstances. Signalling Signalling is an essential part of sharing the road with other drivers without getting into an accident. It allows other drivers to know your intentions and take or avoid action as necessary. Being on a bicycle doesn't change that, except to make the consequences to you even more painful. Traffic signs Stop signs, traffic lights, and the like exist on public roads so that drivers who meet at intersections or turns can move through the same space without turning the roads into a giant game of chicken. If a light is red, you wait until it turns green, so that opposing traffic can pass before you, instead of directly INTO you. As with the above, bicyclists seems to believe that they are exempt from this, when they are more liable than most to get killed breaking it. Not a day goes by in Seattle that I don't see a bicycle skip a red light, jump a curb, split traffic, or casually pedal down the street with six cars behind him. I understand sharing the road, but the fact is that roads are meant for motorized vehicles. If I behaved the way bicyclists do while riding a motorcycle, I'd be up to my eyeballs in tickets. I'll share the road, but EVERYONE should have to follow the rules.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>If a government gave cheap, affordable, and safe opoids to addicts, we could cut down dramatically on the number of deaths caused by over doses. Most addicts are addicted to opoids because they have experienced severe mental illness, such as depression, and use the drug as a method to escape their psychological pain, much as how a person who has undergone physical pain uses morphine to treat their symptoms until the pain is manageable. A pain patient, who is using morphine, gets the proper amount, which allows them to go about their lives while managing their pain. There are many productive people in our society who use opioids for pain management and are still able to contribute in a meaningful way. The biggest reason addicts cannot contribute to society is because they're constantly trying to earn enough to afford expensive, illicit drugs. This results in crime, and is bad for both the addict and society as a whole. They're also contributing to organized crime by funding hard drug dealers, who are selling illicit drugs, which may not be safe. Drug dealers are under no pressure to maintain drug purity and monitor potency through analysis because why should they, they're illegal drug dealers. They often cross contaminate drugs, which is a huge reason for seeing overdose deaths from fentanyl, and it's analogues. A government system by which users could go to see a mental health professional to receive an authorization to go and get free Or very affordable opioids, or opioid substitutes such as Kratom mitragyna would allow addicts to use drugs, who's potency is known, and monitored, in a safe, clean environment, without stressing about dying from an fentanyl overdose, or having to worry about paying a dangerous drug dealer. The drug users could attend therapy sessions which would help them feel accepted and valued by society, allowing them to become contributing members of society while still recovering from their addiction. This system is very unlikely to increase drug use, since drugs such as heroin, aren't exactly drugs young people experiment with. You need to be in a situation where you use the drug to escape some sort of mental or physical pain to become addicted. This program would appear to be expensive, however, it would likely save tax payers money. First, law enforcement is expensive, and the costs of dismantling drug rings is astronomical and highly ineffective. Law enforcement spends a great deal of time arresting small time users and dealers, which is a waste of resources. Second, the cost of treating overdoses is expensive and draining on emergency medical services, since overdoses are clearly preventable, and less resources would need to be allocated for EMT responders and ER staff to treat overdoses. Third, the addicts would be able to work toward living normal lives, and contribute to society, pay taxes, and buy consumer products.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>To start, I want to make it clear I'm not leaving because I'm dropping out rather, I'm able to graduate after only two years of high school. Second, I want to point out that I will also be getting my Associates in Mathematics the same year I graduate. Third, I plan on going to a university immediately afterwards and begin working on my Bachelors and beyond. Finally, before getting into it, I am involved in school and volunteer activities I'm in debate and quiz bowl, and I'm part of my city's Mayor's Youth Commission, among others. I'm asking this because a lot of people seem to think that I should stay in high school longer, and I can understand a few of their arguments. I want to graduate because there's nothing left for me at the high school I will have exhausted it academically, and I see no reason, nor hold any want, to stay there if I don't gain anything from it. The most common argument I hear is, High school is about the social experience and getting ready to deal with people I.E., it's preparing me socially. Too this argument, and without going into much detail, I have been subject to a very, very messy custody battle, practically since birth. My parents acted like toddlers throughout the whole thing, and, due to that, I lost whatever childhood I had at an early age. I had to mature incredibly fast to deal with it and keep me sane, so I don't believe that this argument applies to me. The second argument I commonly hear, is that I should stay in high school so that I can spend time with my friends and family. To start, I don't have an incredible amount of friends the few I do have I usually talk to over the phone anyways. And, due to the above situation with my parents, I don't particularly care to stay around them longer than I have to the only thing that I want out of them right now is for them to give their permission for my early graduation last year. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I have several arguments as to why I believe the movement to replace the electoral college is misguided. The core tenet is that the main actors at play in the U.S political system are the reason why the EC generates negative impacts and those actors will still exist in a direct popular vote count. To expect their nefarious outcomes to change in a world where the vote counting method changes is somewhat silly. Two party machine The two party machine in the U.S is the precursor to any discussion of swing states. The reason why there are only a few swing states is that the two parties have built up reliable enough voting blocks to have their set wall of states mostly in place. Those voting blocks will likely hold in direct popular vote count. Partisan Media The media in my opinion carries large influence in our perception of safe and swing states. The media uses voting data from past elections to sell the narrative that various states are liberal or conservative and voters act in accordance by not voting when they assume their state is safely going against their choice. The direct popular vote count would be analyzed based on voting data from EC elections so the narrative that pushes specific blocks to vote or not will still remain. Urban areas especially those in blue states that have their voting weight diminished in the EC benefit from stronger state and municipal governments than folks in mostly rural states. In fact I would see it as a negative if folks who live in states less dependent on federal policies had equal voting weight to folks who were more dependent on fed policy. The urban voters would be having their cake and eating it too in a direct popular vote which would further infuriate rural voters and polarize the government. A direct popular vote places are larger share of power in the hands of suburban voters than any urban vs rural weighting in the EC can account for. Population data tells us that 15 of the U.S population lives within the city limits of one of the 50 major metros. Expand to includes the metro areas in those 50 cities and you get 80 of the U.S. population. 65 of the U.S. lives in a suburb thus suburban voter interests would decide EVERY popular vote count. This has negative impacts on rural and urban voters since these folks are in the status quo more marginalized socioeconomically than suburban folks. <|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Maybe I don't understand its goals, but my hope was that the March for Science would promote science and policies based on science, like fighting climate change. And to do that, it's not enough to turn out big crowds the Women's March had big crowds a few months ago, and so what? What we need to do is to influence politicians. But as things went, the March for Science will probably have the opposite effect, sadly. The reason I think that is that the president, congress, and the senate are all Republican. We have to appeal to them. The best way to do that would be to have a broad coalition of scientists, Republicans and Democrats, standing side by side and showing that science isn't a partisan issue. Especially important would be the Republicans in that picture we need a solid lineup of prominent scientists saying, We are Republicans, and we want our party to take science seriously. Other Republicans might listen to that. They won't listen to a bunch of progressives with anti Trump signs, as many of them were. All the liberal people I follow on Twitter are for the March, while all the conservative people I follow are not I try to follow a mixed group to not live in a bubble . Likewise, reading news reports, it's clear the demonstrators are overwhelmingly liberal. And opinion pieces by liberals are for it, by conservatives against. Looking for any positive sign of Republican representation in the March, I saw at best things ambivalent things like gt “Even people who voted Republican can still get behind clean air for their grandchildren,” a liberal said Washington Post So to me, this shows that the March has failed to turn out both sides. And by turning out mostly the left, it is politicizing science even more. The Republicans in power can just say, well, another protest by liberals, like the Women's March, they oppose us on everything anyhow. Why did the March fail? I'm not sure, but it's clear from the mission statement and other details on the March's website that it caters to a liberal point of view. It doesn't look like it even tried to build bridges to the conservative side, despite saying science isn't partisan . Just saying that isn't enough. <|CONCLUSION|>

Our family has been here for 70 years, we have ten thousand acres filled with cattle, and not once has any calf or person been disturbed by a black bear.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I believe that until we are free to do what we want to with our own bodies and our own lives we do not have true personal freedom. This belief extends into gay marriage, euthanasia, abortion, and a lot of other things for me but for the sake of this argument I'm just focusing on drugs. I don't see how it's the government's business to pass laws on what chemicals we put into our own bodies, period. I think if America erased the drug laws, stopped incarcerating people for nonviolent drug offenses, and instituted a focus on a world class drug rehabilitation system we would see a revolution in people's attitudes and habits regarding them. I think what's happening in America with people voting on marijuana decriminalization is a sign that the culture is starting to realize that we need to deal with drug use in a more responsible, educated, and mature way. If you think you can change my views on this I'd love to hear your argument. Ninja grammar edit<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>For context, I am a registered Democrat and consider myself a very liberal person. I think that Trump is a disgrace to the presidency, and I think that they way he has deemed all news that speaks badly of him “fake news” is extremely dangerous. However, it seems to me that CNN, MSNBC, etc have shot themselves in the foot by devoting so much time to the Muller investigation over the past two years, and by reporting on it as if they were 100 certain that the investigation would lead to clear collusion and or obstruction charges against Trump. I think that a lot of people, including myself, felt like these news sources laid out a clear path to a Trump impeachment as soon as Muller finished his investigation, and that Trump Fox News would end up making fools of themselves for calling the whole thing a “witch hunt.” However, it seems like the opposite has happened. Even when the full report comes out, I don’t see how this could be anything except for a huge win for Trump. I’ve always been skeptical of news sources and attempted to fact check anything I read. Someone please convince me that Fox News isn’t right in saying that I was blinded by my hatred for Trump when I believed everyone who was saying this investigation would be a bombshell against Trump. Edit woah that’s my first gold, thanks stranger IMPORTANT EDIT this really blew up, and it was brought to my attention that people are using this as evidence of liberals becoming pro trump or something along those lines. So if people are quoting this post, please include this I STILL DONT LIKE TRUMP. AT ALL. Regardless of my trust in liberal media, I STRONGLY disagree with almost everything Trump says, does, and stands for. It is insanely hypocritical to look at this post and say, “see, Fox News was telling the truth the whole time.” If you are agreeing with my criticism of CNN and MSNBC, you should be equally if not more outraged by Fox News.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>In the U.S right now, there is a focus on xenophobic ideas and keeping immigrants out of our country. Given the large number of illegals we have here and the already extraordinary measures we take as a nation to keep them from coming here in the first place. I believe the best course of action is to legalize as many law abiding immigrants as possible. Why? So we can tax them. That is what I believe to be their largest negative impact on our nation. They aren't being taxed, yet they can benefit from tax funded services. The IRS loses billions every year on immigrants claiming relatives on their tax returns, as well. Claims on relatives that don't even reside in the U.S. This is really an oversight issue, but it's part of the problem. EDIT I know this may be inconsequential, but if you want to understand my disposition more then here is my view on migrants to the U.S as a whole.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I've always feared prison, its given me constant discouragement from doing illegal things and it freaks me out when I realize I have done something at all illegal . Misdemeanors, in my opinion, should NEVER have prison time. Our prisons are crowded anyway, and if there is anything that is valuable to a person, its the time in their life. I really hate the justice system we live under, criminals which have actual problems need therapy and help, criminals which did something minor need financial or work based community service discipline depending on their ability to afford the bill, so that we don't cripple the poor which already have understandably higher crime . But jail time? That should be reserved for the people which you and I can not feel safe living among, and I feel like most of the criminals who are there are nothing like that So yah, discuss. A summary Jail should be about the containment of the worst criminals, separating them from society for fear of societies well being. It should also contain reform measures. It should NOT be about discipline, rather protection. Discipline should be financial or work based, for all criminals, depending on the crime and that persons income level.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Occupy Wallstreet is a prime example, Point 1, every mainstream media outlet vilified the protesters, or made them seem like clowns. Point 2, police in major cities Which are now militarized went undercover as protesters and tried And sometimes succeeded to turn a peaceful protest into a riot, so that all of those shiny new police resources could finally be used. Special Weapons and Tactics teams see more use directly against peaceful demonstrations than they do against violent criminals. Point 3, low level politicians are happy to pass resolutions and laws to say that they 'did something' and are 'listening' to the populace, but the highest levels of government, where actual, effective policy is written and enforced, is entirely beyond the influence of the public, and entirely beyond the influence of non violent forms of political expression.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Coming from a purely environmental standpoint so ignoring all moral concerns regarding animal welfare I think that veganism produces the smallest footprint, followed by vegetarianism, followed by diets high in meat and dairy. I love eating meat, but I recognise that it has largely unacceptable environmental impacts when consumed in the quantities we eat today, so I have cut back significantly but still occasionally treat myself. It occurred to me recently however, that the fact that I still consume dairy at about the same rate as before might mitigate some or all of my efforts. However after a quick google to find some numbers to crunch I found this The average Brit consumes 18.4kg of beef per year The average steer yields 222kg of beef So we can take from that the a single steer would give enough meat for a single Brit to live off for around 12 years. Meanwhile on the dairy side The average American drink 18 gallons of milk per year The average cow produces 2,500 gallons of milk per year This means that the average American could get all their milk needs from a single cow if it lived that long for 139 years. So put another way, you need ~11.5 steers slaughtered for meat for every 1 cow producing milk. I couldn’t find equivalent statistics regarding dairy products as a whole but let’s be generous and say we need double the amount of milk drunk to produce a years supply of dairy products like cheese and cream and butter, this would mean ~5.75 slaughtered cattle to every one dairy cow. So my calculations here tell me that compared to a meat and dairy diet, a vegetarian diet would require around 5.75x fewer animals to be bred and slaughtered while a vegan diet would be while vegans would improve on that only by having that solitary dairy cow not exist. So while it seems better to go vegan, that, for many people is very hard, but you can achieve the lions share of the environmental benefits of going vegan by just going vegetarian.

<|TOPIC|>Should voters in the UK have a final vote on the Brexit deal?<|ARGUMENT|>One of the main reasons cited by the Leave Campaign - that of £350 million per day being saved which could be used to fund the NHS - is unlikely to have actually been spent on the NHS at all. It is much more likely that it will be spent on giving tax breaks to [corporations](<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Does the European Union lack the necessary public discourse to function properly?<|ARGUMENT|>A strong German identity in the 1930s did not bring about more peace. A strong Russian identity in the 1910s did not bring about more peace. A strong British identity in the 1800s did not bring about more peace. An expansionist EU identity could also increase the risk of conflict.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>There should be no limit to freedom of speech.<|ARGUMENT|>Limits on freedom of speech diminish our humanity. It suggests that people will be unable to make good decisions, and it does not give the opportunity for people to make good decisions with the information we are given.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Is Morality Objective?<|ARGUMENT|>As man created artificial intelligence, robots & automatons which follow his instructions blindly evidently without criticizing, blaming or going against him, it is unlikely God would be so foolish to have created conscious beings with free will many of whom don’t believe He exists, criticize Him, even blame, go against or harm Him, which may indicate that nature, e.g., humans, is not the creation of God/God does not exist.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Should short-term apartment leasing services such as Airbnb be prohibited in New York City?<|ARGUMENT|>A recent Nielsen global survey found that [over two thirds]( of respondents said they would both share their assets for financial gain, and rent products/services from others in a share community. This suggests that the majority of people believe that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages of a service that functions via the sharing economy, and support its continued existence.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Disregarding race, class is definitely more oppressive than gender. Class opens the door of opportunity for many people, even minority women, who are widely considered the most oppressed in society, have the opportunity to achieve success if they are in the middle or upper class. Class gives you multiple resources that people in the lower class simply do not have, like connections. Race and gender will always be oppressive, but there are still elites in each of these categories that are largely sanctioned off for the poor. In my opinion, living in a capitalist society, money is most important, not for personal happiness, but it is essential for someone's standard of living. Money can not get rid of all of the oppression, but it certainly could help, because as the old saying says, money makes the money go round . Do you agree?<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Tax Payers Money Should Be Used To Fund Top Sportsmen and Women<|ARGUMENT|>Using state funding to produce top athletes is the only way to produce sporting success today. Other nations will put money into sport anyway - we have to do so too to keep up with them or our athletes will be at a disadvantage.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Water Resources, a Commodity<|ARGUMENT|>Control and management of water – the maintenance of dams, reservoirs, flood defences and irrigation systems – costs billions of dollars and is a burden on upstream states’ budgets. All of these expenses, including the opportunity costs of fertile lands allocated for reservoirs and dams, should be covered by downstream states, which are usually the primary consumers of water. For example, it is unfair if an upstream state cannot use the water flowing through it to produce electricity to offset the costs of water management.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Should Religions Receive Public Funding?<|ARGUMENT|>A [meta-analysis of 90 studies]( found that students at faith-based schools scored 11 percentile points higher on standardized tests on average than their peers at traditional public and charter schools. The researchers also concluded that students at faith-based schools had fewer behavioral issues.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Is political correctness detrimental to society?<|ARGUMENT|>PC is psychologically [traumatizing]( to those who want to freely think and collaborate with people benevolently \(they worry about accidentally offending and distressing the ones they're with\); they become [afraid to do anything]( causing them to "freeze up" \(which leads to self-censorship\) instead of having positive thought and action.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>Should the US remove Confederate memorials, flags, and monuments from public spaces?<|ARGUMENT|>Since Washington and Jefferson were not alive at the time of the Confederacy, it should not be assumed that they would have been on the side of the Confederacy had they been alive to make that choice. So objecting to monuments of the Confederacy does not imply that one must object to honoring all slave-holding figures in history.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Theresa May has recently continued to show that she does not support a second referendum, saying that a second referendum would threaten social cohesion and shatter faith in democracy I think that, perhaps, faith in democracy needs a bit of shattering. Brexit has proven some of democracy's largest flaws groups of politicians can lie to the masses about numbers they can't verify themselves think big buses saying brexit is going to add hundreds of millions of pounds to the NHS budget , have it completely work when the people vote for what is nearly an economically objectively poor decision, admit they lied about things, and get away with it with no consequences, and then any attempt to rectify the situation is seen as threatening democracy. Well, if that's how democracy can work, perhaps democracy has some flaws after all that we should look into mitigating instead of pretending its a perfect system of government. TLDR Even if a second referendum were to shatter people's faith in democracy, considering democracy got us into this situation, it ought to be shattered.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Morality can be established by universal, objective, and secular means. A few things 1 Morals are based on actions. It is untenable to extend morals to thoughts and or preferences. It is no more a moral issue of whether one favors the idea of murder no more than it is if one favors the color green. 2 The actions mentioned above are ones that have the capability of disrupting our preferred states by means of universally undesirable behavior. theft, murder, assault, lying the big four . 3 It is impossible to have a preferred state be disrupted by a universally preferable behavior. i.e, one cannot have their preferred state of alive be disrupted by not murder. One cannot lose possession of their property by not being stolen from. 4 Actions that disrupt our preferred states must be undesirable actions one cannot be stolen from if they want to be stolen from stealing, by definition, cannot be preferred by both parties simultaneously . 5 Actions that disrupt our preferred states are bad. 6 Committing actions that disrupt preferred states is immoral. Immoral acts have consequences. 7 These principles can be universally and objectively applied without infringing on any individuals preferred state or permitting one to infringe on any other's preferred state. To CMV For me, this view hinges on an action not being able to be good and bad at the same time, as these concepts are opposite of each other 3 1 cannot be 4 and 4, for example . For the person who decides to murder, there is an obvious good , but for that good to somehow outweigh the bad of the person being murdered seems to me impossible to reconcile. If someone can establish that an action can be both good and bad for the same person, I'd be open to changing my view. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>To be more specific, I understand why we would need to list other human beings as 'Male' and 'Female' when it comes to reproduction, or accepted biological differences such as increased testosterone and estrogen. My main problem lies in this idea that there are a correct 'Feminine' and 'Masculine' behaviours that we should or shouldn't exhibit especially considering how much we've progressed in society now. As an example, there are many stereotypes that are often attributed to different genders, such as Men are not in touch with their feelings, or women don't play computer games. Personally I think any such things are mainly determined by our society and, therefore, are archaic and outdated. I think it is possible for a man to be far more intouch with his emotions than some women. So we shouldn't define characteristics in this way. EDIT Well I didn't expect this many responses, I want to thank everyone for the effort in getting back to me. I believe my question should maybe have been phrased a little differently but, if I was to do so, I'd have a pretty obvious answer. Special thanks to Dr Wreck and NefariousMagpie, I enjoyed their conversation a lot<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I went through and did some back of the envelope math to try to figure out the pocketbook impacts of a carbon tax of 100 US Dollars per Metric Ton of CO2 equivalent, and it seems like such a tax would have minimal impact on actual behavior. Starting with gasoline. Per EPA the average family sedan in the US emits 4.6 tons of CO2 per year. That's 460 dollars per year on average. Given that the average fuel consumption according to the Energy Information Administration as cited here is 656 gallons per year, that comes out to an effective increase of roughly 70 cents per gallon. Given that many drivers make few trips that were not already necessary and that fuel prices already vary significantly across both time and geography, such a small price increase seems unlikely to make a significant impact on total fuel consumption. Second, I looked at flights. According to this calculator a nonstop one way flight from LAX to JFK produces 0.746 tons of CO2, for a carbon tax fee of 74.6 dollars. This is well within the variation of flight prices and thus also unlikely to significantly reduce the total number of trips Third, I looked at beef. According to The University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems a serving of beef produces 6.6 pounds of CO2e, or 0.003 metric tons. That would increase the price of a serving of beef by 30 cents, again not likely enough to significantly impact consumption. A 100 dollar per ton tax is also on the high end of proposals that I've seen. The recent carbon tax bill that was defeated in Washington State would have started at 15 ton and increased steadily to cap at 100 ton, and many other proposals or enacted laws also seem to be on the order of tens to dozens of dollars per ton. For a carbon tax to have real impact on atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, it must be sufficiently high that emissions are actually reduced, which means that it must be sufficiently high that the rate of behaviors that result in emissions is also reduced. And 100 dollars per ton which, as I mentioned, is on the high end of proposed or enacted carbon prices is simply too low to significantly impact behavior. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I'm a software engineer in Silicon Valley. Many companies are trying to get more women into tech. There are many reasons for doing so, let's assume for the sake of argument that it makes sense to encourage more women to enter the tech industry. Most people agree that the best way to do this is to start at an early point in a girl's life encourage them to get into tech starting from before university. Many people believe that fewer girls are interested in tech because they see tech as a men's field . Therefore, even in primary school, girls shy away from tech whereas boys embrace it. Therefore, tech companies are helping to promote tech as a welcoming field for both sexes. However, I don't believe girls choose not to pursue tech primarily because they see it as a men's field . Rather, I believe from an early age, boys spend more time around computers because they play more PC games. Naturally, they tinker with the computers outside of games. By the time they have the choice to take their first computer science course, they're already more familiar with computers on average than girls of the same age. Therefore, they're more likely to take the computer science courses. Then, since there are more boys in the class, some girls feel uncomfortable and stop taking it. This becomes a cycle until we get the drastic sex ratios we see today. To clarify this position, I will use anecdotes In primary school, my friends and I would go to the library to play computer games after class. We'd research gaming strategies and participate in forums to share strategies. No girls came with us, despite our attempts to invite them already hit puberty . At this point, us boys were already more familiar with the Internet than the girls. In the final year of primary school, someone learned how to make websites using Google Sites Google Page Creator . He made a website to share gaming strategies and cheat codes. He taught us all how to make websites, so we each made our own. It became a competition to see whose site had more traffic. In middle school, I stopped making websites, but my friends and I played a lot of PC games together. We wanted to play a new paid game, so we learned how to torrent. At the same time, we learned about viruses, firewalls, evaluating online content for reliability, etc. I torrented video editing software and became familiar with them. In class, I was known as the guy who was good at editing videos for class projects. As far as I knew, no girls had the fancy software I had. In high school, I noticed my computer was lagging when I played certain games. I did some research and learning that I should have 4GB of RAM rather than 2GB. I opened my desktop and saw that there were 2 1GB sticks. I bought 2 2GB sticks and replaced them. Around the same time, I learned that I could hack a game by editing some files. Thus, I learned Lua scripting. No girls I knew had similar experiences. By the time I had my first computer science class in high school, I was already far more familiar with computers than my classmates who didn't play PC games many boys and almost all girls . The first term of computer science in high school, almost everyone took it. Roughly half the class were girls. However, it was clear that some of the boys were far more experienced with computers than everyone else. For each subsequent term, the percentage of girls dropped. By the final year of high school computer science, there was 1 girl who now works at Google . I don't think the issue was that girls in particular were dissuaded from computer science. Rather, there were several boys that started high school computer science far more experienced with computers than everyone else. Therefore, everyone else including other boys were discouraged from taking more computer science courses. In the end, most of us left in computer science were PC gamers. In university and in the workplace, anecdotally speaking, there's a strong correlation between PC gamers and computer scientists. Some would argue that individuals with a certain personality introverted, asocial prefer both PC games and computer science. I agree. However, I would argue that another reason why there's a strong correlation is because the love of PC gaming pushed people into computer science. If my view is correct, there needs to be a change in the way Silicon Valley gets more girls into tech. Rather than merely changing girls' opinions of tech, girls must also naturally find their ways around computers starting from a young age.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I'd like to start this by clearly defining my position I think only cisgender, and by that I mean identifying with the gender you are born with, is a valid gender identification. I don't know if valid is the right world but it's the only one that sounds appropriate. Essentially, I think gender and biological sex are one and the same, gender is just a social construct to express our biological sex. In every animal in nature we can find two sexes, male and female. Sometimes the sexes have similar roles, sometimes the male or the female has more important roles, it doesn't matter It's there, and it's happening in nature. I'm not making an appeal to nature as a form of fallacy, I'm merely pointing out that it's a special pleading fallacy to think humans are special because we can get away with ignoring our biological sex. I admit that Humans have less sexual dimorphism than other animals and namely we can find, aside from physical and procreation capacities, little differences between men and women because both are capable of amazing things. I'm ok with abolishing or ignoring gender roles and allowing boys and girls to play with what they want. What we can't do is to pretend that we can magically change the sex we are born into. To use an analogy, if I decided to transplant my nose and put some whiskers and called myself a tiger, would I be a tiger or just a nutjob? What would you consider me? The primary argument for transgenderism is that gender dysphoria makes people feel bad about the biological sex they are born with or the gender they were assigned at birth, and therefore they have the right to identify with what makes them more comfortable. This sounds nice and reasonable, but the issue is that thinking we are something does not make us that something. I can imagine I'm a dragon in my head but that doesn't change the fact dragons don't exist and I'm still Human. To categorize and simplify arguments 1 Every or most species have a male and female specimen and, regardless of what roles each one has, to think Humans are different is a special pleading, kinda like thinking Humans will forever be the best species on the universe 2 The fact someone's brain tells them something is wrong or better doesn't mean it's true. If your brain can identify as a genderqueer or genderneutral, I don't see how I can't identify as a rock or a dragon. Why is the latter less valid? The fact the brain identifies as such doesn't mean we are such, it's irrelevant. If you are born with a penis, you are a man and if you are born with a vagina, you are a woman. There are obvious biological features specially related to procreation and body shape. Some transgender people, even those who have surgery, will forever look similar to the gender they don't want to be associated it, it's inevitable. The fact I want to change my deepest self doesn't mean I am actually doing it. 3 Why is gender special? In short, why can't I magically change other things about myself? I look white, and I know race is a social construct It's still a useful concept to categorize us Why can't I identify as black even with pale skin? Why can't a redhead identify as a black hair? Why can't children identify as adults, etc.? Again, special pleading. Oh, I also think the word cisgender shouldn't even be used. Some notes I am not promoting violence and hate against transgender people. If I meet someone who is trans, I will treat them like I treat anyone else. I can disagree with the core idea without hating the person. Don't bring up analogies to gay people and gay marriage because both are incomparable and completely different topics. Don't use you're a bigot as an argument My arguments have nothing to do with religion, I'm an atheist.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I have never seen a time in American history where it was more acceptable to absolutely hate the President. I was a liberal in the early 2000s and we hated Bush, but absolutely nothing to this extent. People weren't declining visits to the white house en masse, demanding that major websites ban communities that support the President it's staggering to me online communities that support the President of the United States are considered super fringe and controversial and far right? Supporting the president of the united states is like the most status quo thing ever , or anything like this environment. I've tried to understand why people hate this guy so much and it doesn't make any sense to me. I didn't even vote for him in '16. I probably will in '20 though because it absolutely sickens me what the left is doing during his presidency and I want to take a stand against it. I've talked to leftists to see what they hate about the guy. They call him racist, sexist, every ism under the sun, and I say okay, tell me specifically what policies Trump has supported or enacted that have violated the human rights or civil rights of Americans. They bring up the immigrant child cages and all this illegal immigration stuff. None of that is happening to American citizens. I ask them again, what polices is Trump enacting that violate the rights of American citizens, I don't want to hear about your extra national loyalties. They bring up the Muslim ban. Again, completely irrelevant as it doesn't apply to American citizens. This just demonstrates to me that the left is not pro America these days. Something weird has happened very recently, maybe in the past 5 years, where the American left seems to care about all these rights of people who are country doesn't have the slightest obligation to foreign migrants, foreign muslims instead of our own people. It's realllly turned me away from the left, hard. I ask again. What policy has Trump enacted that violates the rights of American citizens. No stories about foreigners being dealt with, no stories of women who's feelings Trump hurt in the 90s, I want policies, bills, laws, executive orders. I want something tangible. They won't give it to me. What else, they hate him because he doesn't want to give you free stuff? All these Democrats are running on the promise of hating successful people and stealing their money to give to you for no apparent reason. If you support that, fine, but no one is entitled to a single cent in this world. If you want more money, that's awesome, go improve your skills and find someone willing to pay you more money, don't blame Trump that you're a life failure you know? If you want a politician who screws up the economy to give you free stuff, okay, fine, but that's hardly new and hardly a reason to hate the guy so much. I've disagreed with the economic philosophies of most Presidents, but didn't loathe them so deeply for it. What else is there? You're mad that he dared to think independently after Charlotsville and said there were problems with both sides, instead of taking the easy way out and Nazi bashing with everyone else? There were problems with both sides when 50 right wingers show up to march and lawfully protest, it's probably not a great idea to go try to outnumber them 10 to 1 like you're so tough, provoke them and shout at them in every way possible and turn your town into a warzone. Do you know how easy it would have been for Trump to be a spineless politician like everyone else and say something milquetoast and noncontroversial like Nazis super bad, Nazis evil, sad day for America, I praise all the counterprotestors who can do no wrong. You don't have to agree with his assessment to admire him for not being a puppet. He talks in weird speech patterns? Eh, he's more literate than Bush was and y'all didn't hate him like this. He even signed a bill to reform the Justice system, which is a cause I supported as a liberal and still support today wasn't this something major you guys wanted? Sure, it doesn't go far enough, but it's more than Obama did. Then there's all this Russia crap that won't die, despite nothing being turned up. Again, I don't want media stories about Trump said this, trump did that. Tell me what policies Trump enacted that are affecting you so badly. People can't do it All in all, I can't understand all the Trump hate. Trump has done precisely 1 thing in office that I have found unforgiveable He signed FOSTA. Most of these anti Trumpers probably don't even know what FOSTA is, even though it was worse than all these perceived evils trump has committed combined. But Bernie and almost every other left winger in Congress voted for FOSTA too, so All in all, this Trump hate seems to be borne out of extranational loyalties, and misinformation and misprioritization. As an American citizen, I think you would be hard pressed to name specific ways in which Trump has made your life worse. CMV.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>We pay sports analysts millions of dollars to break down the action and provide us with in depth percentages, averages, records, comparison and opinion probably because we need filler in between segments. Some fans track this stuff obsessively. Not that there's an absolute dichotomy, but others are interested in role playing games or character based stories where statistical accomplishments are equally as important. LARPing, D D, Magic The Gathering, etc. My view is that if we're to judge these Star Trek dorks for keeping track of Klingon grammar, we should hold those who obsess over sports statistics to the same standard of utter meaninglessness. Though we're making strides in social acceptance, there is a line drawn at least in the United States between the tolerance level of one versus the other in the main stream. None ought to be viewed as more nerdy than the other. I'm very open to changing my view. edit Backwards causation of nerd label. View changed.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>We never really know the whole story when we only see 15 20 seconds of video. As is often the case with video that goes viral, there is usually a lot more to the story than what is caught on film. This story played right into the hands of the SJW outrage set by pitting an innocent minority against being abused by corporate america . I think it is more likely this passenger manipulated the situation, knowing that by refusing to debark he would be forcibly removed, and that the use of force would allow him a window of opportunity to sue the airline and airport security and hit a lawsuit jackpot for millions at either a trial or most likely a settlement agreement.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I mean the equation of drinkable water with bottled water, which has become all too common in recent years in the US and many other countries. In many places, tap water is drinkable but is avoided out of irrational fear. Hypochondria and first world problem ism are partly responsible for this. If you go through life drinking tap water where it tastes okay, you'll be fine. In many cases there's literally no quality difference. Where tap water isn't pristine, often faucet filters can be used. A lot more economical, and convenient. If the tap water is undrinkable even with a filter, and if that's due to the condition of the public water supply itself and not an on site plumbing problem, then it should be a priority for that community to fix their damn water . Relying on bottled water should be, at most, a temporary measure, for anyone in any EDIT urban suburban community in any developed nation. Clean water should be absolutely basic. It's just massively wasteful, as a society, to be piping water into homes and bottling, selling and buying huge quantities of it. All the trains and trucks shipping it around, all the plastic, all the labor of moving this heavy substance around in small containers. The salary of every marketing rep trying sell designer water , the shelf space in supermarkets, and so on. All those resources could and should be going to other things.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I've observed how most of my friends are interested in the cultures and languages of developed countries. Very few of them are interested in the cultures languages of developing countries. I didn't ask them why but I think this is due to how it is more worthy to learn about the cultures languages of developed countries than developing ones Developed countries tend to have a dominance in politics and pop culture There must be a reason why developed reasons are developed this may have something to do with its culture eg. a culture which encourages hard work and innovation and this implies that there is something good about that culture. The low living standards of developing countries implies that there are flaws with their cultures. Learning the language of a developed country may lead to business opportunities with people from that country and they are the ones with money Learning a language may lead to opportunities where you get to work abroad and nobody from a developed country wants to immigrate to a developing country Learning the language makes traveling to the countries where the language is spoken easier and traveling to developed countries is better due to better hygiene, less pickpocketing and better infrastructure Often learning a language requires you to fall in love with the culture of that country it is very hard to fall in love with the culture of a developing country when you know about the living conditions there. It is much easier to fall in love with the culture of a country where you can picture yourself living there<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>The Ethics of Eating Animals: Is Eating Meat Wrong?<|ARGUMENT|>Saying that a practice also causes a negative is not a counter argument. Everything effectively can be shown to create negatives. The issue is not if the practice is pristine and only creates positive outcomes, but the degree to which it creates less negatives. Animal agriculture creates more harm for animals. Animal agriculture includes all the harm of plant based agriculture plus the direct harm of farm animals. Farm animals are fed the plants, and much more than it would take to feed humans.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>This is only for the US I know this isn't necessarily the case for other countries. OK so lets look at all the options at least that I can think of which you can do after high school besides of going to college. If there is anything else please feel free to share. Straight to work Ok where could you possibly work that is a steady reliable job which will make you a lot of money in the future? I'm sure these jobs do exist, but you must admit they are hard to find and are a rarity. Many more of those jobs do exist IF you have a college degree. Military Not everyone can do it like me personally I want to but medically can't bc asthma . This is a solid way to go, but not better than college not everyone can do it, and there is a risk factor when going into it. Trade school It seems that going to trade school narrows your career choice. If you are unsure on what you want to do when you get out of highschool, why would you decide to focus on only one job? Getting a college degree gives you a wide variety of jobs to choose from trade school narrows your scope for what seems like for the most part rather undesirable jobs. This doesn't mean trade school is bad it just means that for the vast majority of students who aren't 100 sure on what career they want to do when they turn 18, college seems like a much more flexible choice. Starting a business Most high school grads have no idea what they are doing in this area obviously there are very success stories in this, but if I were to go out and start a business next year when I graduate, I would have no idea what to do. It seems that you are better off getting a business or something in that area degree. Now look, obviously college isn't perfect. A LOT of college grads don't get jobs. But it seems that these are the people that get their majors in a bad area like journalism, English, history, etc. and also go to a bad college. It's not supposed to be a sure thing you have to work in high school that way you can go to a better college, and work in college that way you can have good grades All of these options I listed are doable but for me and most people , who still aren't completely independent and have no idea what they want to do with the rest of their lives, college seems like the sure choice. Then there is the cost aspect of it. I get that college isn't always affordable, but that's a separate issue it doesn't mean that going to college itself is bad. Also, and I am not saying that this isn't an issue my sister chose to go to UTD over UPenn for this very reason, it seems that most people buried in student loans chose to go to a super expensive school there's plenty of cheaper ones out there which, assuming you worked hard in high school, give out scholarships. College isn't a sure thing and that's why people are complaining about it. You can't expect it to be and then insult it when its not. YOU have to take advantage of it. And if you do it can be very beneficial EDIT Thanks for the posts everyone Ultimately I apologize for the wording of this question, as I feel I over generalized. What I decided is that, yes, for the vast majority of people college is best. But that doesn't make it the better option in that plenty more people especially those who cannot afford college are better off using one of the other options I previously listed above.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Let me lay out why The countries in the world which are predominantly based upon Islam are generally not nice places to live. Their laws are harsh, their traditions are harsh and oppressive. The regime's are brutal and punishments harsh. They mutilate people so on so fourth. The hijab has become enforced through law and women have next to no rights. Having to marry their rapist, being stoned to death for being raped so on. Child marriage tends to be rampant as many believe within these countries that the prophet pbuh consummated with ayesha at a young age no realising that life spans back in those days tended to be short and sweet, the men and women tended to mature a lot younger than they do how Apostasy is often met with shaming, disowning and sometimes death. Though the Qur'an is no more violent than the bible the followers within these countries, especially, take it all as the word of God which cannot be changed or amended to reflect the world in which we live in now. I believe that the Qur'an needs a updated version so to speak similar to what happened to the bible I am not saying anything against Muslims as we are all human. I am disagreeing with the notion that Islam is a religion of peace based upon the countries where Islam is the religion tend to demonstrate otherwise. Change my view. my account has been verified by the mods Note I am not interested in talking about terrorism as their are Christian terrorist groups and I will not lump benign Muslims in with said group just like I would do for Christians.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>OK everybody, provocative title, I know lol. I wasn't sure how to word it, but I'd like to discuss a pretty complex philosophical concept that I've been thinking about a lot. If there's a better sub to post this in, please, recommend it for me. This is not related to criminal justice, it's more about the nature of sentience. x200B Ok, so what makes it wrong to kill something, say a person. Why is death bad? Well, three reasons. 1 There's the pain of the actual death, say a gunshot, as well as that fear and mental trauma while you're dying. 2 Robbing someone's future. That person had things they wanted to do and goals they wanted to achieve. That person still has goals you just robbed. 3 Their loved ones would be sad. x200B I'd like to take a look at that second one. Why do people have a yearning to continue their existence, into the future? I believe the entire reason for this are the emotions of empathy and sadness. Sadness is the most complex emotion. You have the five core emotions and psychologist will tell you, happiness, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness. Most of these are pretty primitive emotions that go way back in our evolutionary timeline, and they serve obvious purposes. Fear keeps us out of danger. Anger motivates us to fight back. Disgust keeps us from getting diseases or poisoning. Pleasure rewards us for doing basically survival stuff, eating food, having sex, forming social bond, etc. But what's the point of sadness? How does being sad help you survive? Sadness is a function of empathy, without feeling sad ourselves, we wouldn't be capable of feeling bad for other people. And sadness and empathy are pro social emotions, that's what allow social groups to function. The reason why we feel a yearning for the future is sadness. Think about it. People strive for happiness in life, that's the main goal. If you were always happy all the time, you wouldn't have a feeling of wanting to be happy. You need contrast, and sadness provides that. And people strive for emotional connections, those wouldn't work without sadness. Why do we feel nostalgia? We get nostalgic about fond memories, but it's not a feeling of happiness. Nostalgia is a mix of happiness, but also sadness. We miss those old times. Without the sadness, we wouldn't have a reason to care why the past is gone, and we wouldn't have a reason to hope that the future will be good. So even if something is conscious, it still needs sadness to yearn for the future. Take sociopaths. Sociopaths are people who don't have the capacity to feel empathy. Uncoincidentally, they don't feel sadness either. A key trait of sociopaths is that they're impulsive and drawn to risk averse behavior. Life is a game to them, and they don't truly care if they die or others die. Sadness is the emotion that takes us out of the present. It's not for those immediate survival gratifications, sadness lets us contemplate the future or the past emotionally. x200B A lot to unpackage here, but basically I would sum it up as this. It is wrong to kill people because people feel pain, and they feel remorse. Remorse meaning the summation of empathy, sadness, and that whole intertwined emotional complex. Everything that makes killing something else wrong stems from that thing's abilities to feel those two things. Now, if you were to kill someone via lethal injection in their sleep, that takes away the issue of pain. They don't feel physical pain, and they don't feel the emotional pain of fear and trauma. That only leaves the issue of remorse. That person got robbed of their future, and if you had asked them whether they'd be ok with it ahead of time, they'd say no. Yes, that answer is both cause of the fear of dying and the sadness of not enjoying the future, but I'm saying this example to just give a better grip of the concept. In reality we would eliminate the fear because we just kill them without their consent. I swear I'm not a psychopath Therefore, it's only wrong to kill a thing in it's sleep if it is capable of feeling remorse. Now let's apply this concept to different levels of organisms. x200B Bacteria And Single Celled I give zero fucks. Slaughter them. No really, they aren't even conscious, let alone able to feel remorse, so they are basically just a bunch of moving organic parts. They are robots made out of organic materials. If you made a robot that could recharge itself and could build another robot just like it, that would be equivalent in every way to these guys. Kill bacteria any time anywhere Planeria Fish Limited brain function, capacity to feel pain as a physical response, but it's apparently less complex than humans. But human emotions? Doubtful, again limited brain capacity. Not even the basic emotions are there, let alone sadness. So it might not be harmless to kill them straight up, but if you put them to sleep, yes, because they don't have the capacity to care about their future. So in a high tech world where we could put all fish to sleep before killing them, we probably should Animals Highly divisive, debated, and inconclusive whether or not animals feel true human emotions. We simply don't have enough knowledge about the brain to tell. But they have found certain animals like elephants showing behavior indicative of a capacity to feel empathy. Whether or not an animal has the cognitive capacity to understand that it has a future, I have no clue. But if animals do, basically if they are sentient, and if they feel sadness and empathy and all that, they deserve to live Fetus Lmao you thought I was gonna take a stance on Abortion here? No way do I have the guts. Next Sociopaths Not wrong. If you killed a sociopath in their sleep, on an isolated planet where they have no loved ones, it would not be wrong. Because they do not have the capacity for sadness or empathy, so life is a game to them, they don't have that wanting to live out the future. Sure, they work towards the goals of grandeur and success, but they do not feel saddened for not having those. They seek out pleasure and avoid pain, but they do not seek out true happiness or meaningful relationships or anything that would give their life a greater sense of meaning. So without sadness, they don't truly care, about anything. x200B Thoughts on this idea?<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I was watching a Noam Chomsky interview yesterday and he made a really great point, I thought, about the contradiction inherent in our economic system, and therefore our society as a whole. Economics teaches us that consumers make rational decisions, and from this principle we extrapolate economic theory, and justify our free market capitalist system. But Chomsky makes the point that the advertising industry and, by political extension, the PR industry runs on selling things to people that they really don't need. In a sense, much of our economic system is driven by irrational choices. Advertising has us working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need in other words Tyler Durden . If this is the case, we don't have a free market, and the economists don't have any foundation to their theory that we make informed and rational purchases as consumers. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>When Mass Effect 3 came out, a lot of people hated the ending and complained to Bioware. After this response, they issued DLC changing the ending. Basically, this isn't how art works. In my eyes, the main tenet of art is free expression, the ability to say something how you want to say it and make the statement you want with a lack of obligation to change it to fit the views of the public. When fans started the outcry against the ending, it showed that despite what they say, they still treat video games predominately as consumer product and expect them bent to their will and enjoyment. You can't send back a Dali painting or a Death Grips album and say hey, I didn't like this, start over and expect it to be changed, and that leads into the developer's fault in this. The fact that they caved shows that they don't care about making an artistic statement and only care about making money. It's like when bands go back to their old sound because fans don't like new experiments they do. Now, you can probably say that the ending was a disappointment, but that's not the point the point is that that's how Bioware INTENDED for it to end, and the fact that consumers didn't accept that and the company bent to accommodate shows that neither side looks at video games as an art form.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Warning This CMV is about a super boring topic. I was just reading about a bill in US Congress about reinstating Glass Steagall. Apparently the gist of the law is separating investment and not investment banks. I know there have been scandals in the past with banks losing their customers' money with risky investments. And I consider myself progressive and in favor of reasonable restraints on money and power. I've always been confused that we separate our government into three branches to mitigate against one group having all the power, but we don't think the same rules apply to power derived from wealth. However, I want to allow financial institutions to be innovative within ethical boundaries. I want to hold banks responsible for taking inappropriate risks with people's money, but I can't think of a good reason to separate banks along these lines. Sure, make them be super transparent about how they're investing individuals' money. Break up financial institutions over a certain size. But I don't think I agree that separating banks along these commercial investment lines makes any sense. Bonus points to people who correct my bad assumptions about the gist of Glass Steagall.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>As a starting point Nihilism can be defined as the notion that life has no intrinsic meaning or value Alan Pratt, Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy IEP similar wordings define nihilism as the rejection of all religious and moral principles, often in the belief that life is meaningless Google dictionary, and Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. IEP x200B All arguments of morality, ethics, religous values, etc. eventually boil down to some sort of intrinsic value something is right or wrong because it is right or wrong. Take the argument that murder is immoral, and question why. One could argue for the impact of a valuable, contributing member of society being removed. Why is that wrong? Because it negatively effects others in society? Why does that matter? Arguments like this can spin on and on until you come to the ultimate assertion that human life has an intrinsic value, in and of itself. And that belief can be argued through a number of means, such as faith. Human life is valuable because God created and values us. And that argument can be countered with another why Why does god matter? Eventually this circles back again to intrinsic value God's will matters because it matters. It's an argument of belief, either you believe that God matters, or that human life is intrinsically valuable, or you don't, and this can apply to any moral assertion. Because of this, it's just as valid for a person to believe that nothing matters and there is no morality as it is for one to believe in the value of life or in god. x200B Nihilism is logically supportable. x200B But it accomplishes nothing. If you establish a belief that nothing matters, so what? Why does it matter that nothing matters? A nihilist may use that defend acts that others see immoral, but if nothing matters why commit those acts? To satisfy basic desires and impulses? Those don't matter. The argument of nihilism defeats itself, because if nothing has meaning, then nothing is without meaning. Human beings choose to believe that something matters, even if it doesn't. Any action a nihilist takes implies a reason, even if that reason is as simple as because they want to, and therefore implies that they value that reason. x200B Essentially even if nothing matters objectively, something still must matter subjectively. Human beings are not capable of being objective. x200B Edit u nowyourmad helped point out a missing point to what I'm trying to say. My claim is that Nihilism can be logically supported in theory, but in practice is useless because it cannot exist. A person cannot claim that nothing matters or has value because any action they take implies that they are doing so for some reason or motive that matters to them . x200B Please help my change my view<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Whenever I see reddit harping on pre orders I always ask what's so bad about them. No one has ever offered even a half decent argument about why they're so terrible. See this most recent thread for an example. But the game might suck. The only decent argument I ever hear is that you're putting up money for something you may not like. However, you can easily minimize this risk by doing some research on the games. Nowadays it's not unheard of for a game to be thoroughly reviewed by YouTubers or other folks who usually aren't out to sell you the game. There's tons of news, screenshots, subreddit with speculation and discussion. eg. Check out r dragonage for all the DA I info you could want. It's very easy to get a good idea of what you're buying. Also, this risk is almost completely taken out of the picture if you pre order games from franchises or companies you know and like Saints Row, Borderlands, Tomb Raider, etc. and don't throw money at unknown devs. Just buy it when it comes out, after you see the reviews. You can usually see many reviews beforehand, or get an idea for the feel of the game with methods in my previous point. So, given that information, if you're fairly certain you're going to buy the game anytime near release there's no reason not to. In fact , there's incentive to do so, given as pre order bonuses. I've gotten Steam discounts, free DLC, free games, etc., hundreds of dollars worth. Wait for it to be cheaper or on sale. Admittedly this one's great if you're the type who doesn't need to play something on release. However, for games I truly love, I want to play it quick, when all my friends are also playing, so we can talk about it and I'm not sitting here in 2013 saying Hey, you guys heard about that Skyrim game? If you're a sale searcher then, yes, preorders are rarely a good deal. But if you'll be buying near release day you may as well buy before. No, but seriously, the game might suck. I made the mistake of buying a game without much research once. What was the game? WarZ. And what happened? I requested a refund and was promptly refunded. I believe GameStop has some sort of limited duration full return policy, I know WalMart does. If you are led astray via research it's not a big deal to return the game for a refund in most cases. I've even received refunds for mistaken, non pre order purchases from Steam. And so, my view, is that anyone who is going to buy a game near release is best off pre ordering in any situation that you're given free DLC or rewards, which is most big name titles these days. Can anyone CMV?<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I have noticed that a lot of people use emotional support dogs to help them deal with anxiety, depression, addictions etc. Some people will say their dog helps them for essential things like getting up in the morning or being reminded to take pills, or to alert them to the fact that there is pollution in the air for those with asthma . While those are all great uses of a service dog, those issues can be managed in other ways setting an alarm, avoiding places with smoke, getting counseling etc. . And while I don't doubt that dogs can provide great mental relief, they should just be called a pet, not a service animal, if they are not assisting with essential PHYSICAL functions i.e. replacing one's sight or hearing . So only those with an actual impairment to one of their bodily senses should call their dogs service dogs. To be clear this is close to the ADA standard but even more stringent. As someone whose cat has provided me mental relief, I don't refer to him as my service or emotional support animal. He's just a cat, that helps me through life. I wouldn't conflate his purpose with that of a seeing dog.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>In the early days of the novel 18th century , a lot of books were written to resemble actual, real documents Dangerous Liaisons was purportedly a collection of real letters thrown out of a carriage at the author's feet Gulliver's Travels were supposedly actual travel diaries from one Lemuel Gulliver. The notion that some of the stories being published could actually be real not only added to the popularity of such books, but were also a measure of the gullibility of the reader it said something about you if you accepted or rejected the existence of Houyhnhnms. I believe the correct term for this is mystification although that term can also refer to deliberate, malicious forgery with intend to defraud, like James Frey's A Million Little Pieces I'm referring to writing that is not malicious in intent, but playful . As books became more mainstream, and readers more experienced, this kind of deception became less and less effective. These days, bookstores have clearly marked Fiction and Nonfiction sections, and authors presenting fiction as reality might face a lawsuit or public scorn. And that's a shame fiction that provokes and possibly upsets its audience is a testament to the power of the written word. The practice of deceiving your audience has largely fallen out of use. One notable exception is the movie The Blair Witch Project, which was carefully marketed to be actual footage, going so far as contractually forcing the actors involved in the movie to not make any public appearances after the movie came out. Again, the idea that this could actually be real was what made the movie such a sensation which is not to say that it's a masterpiece necessarily . Now on to the Jenny and Carly story for those who don't know it, a series of r tifu posts here is part 1 claiming to be about OP discovering his wife's infidelity . The posts have become wildly popular over the last few days, and have invited lots of speculation about their veracity. People are examining OP's posts for clues that he's lying, and I think it's safe to argue that not knowing if it's real or not is part of the attraction of the story the comments definitely suggest so . Many comments also say that the posts are entertaining regardless of whether they're true or not. So popular, controversial, playing with notions of truth or falsehood it fits the bill. My conclusion is that, if forged, OP's posts can be considered as a form of literature. You can argue about the quality of the literature, but you can't deny its impact plenty of redditors were mesmerized for several days, hanging onto every update that OP produced. Plenty of published books cannot claim the same kind of effect. Most of all, I applaud the fact that a new channel has been found for presenting fiction as fact. I'd love to hear your arguments against my claim. Edit Delta awarded to u DaystarEld. Calling this 'literature' is too much of a stretch. Edit 2 Delta awarded to u duckwantbread, who rightly points out that the deception only works because it is pandering.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Promote Safe Sex through Education at Schools<|ARGUMENT|>The internet provides a vast amount of easily accessible information about sex, of varying degrees of quality. Most children in the west now have access to the internet and are therefore likely to have access to this information on sex, or at least educational materials on sex even if the child’s access to the internet is controlled. Given that it is impossible to prevent children from accessing this information if they really want to, it makes sense to present it to them in an organised and accurate fashion. Rather than allowing children to find information on their own through what may well be unreliable resources it is necessary that they should get good reliable information. That this information when there is safe sex education comes from the school means that the children know that they information is reliable. They can then use this information to help them decide how reliable any further information they may find from other sources is.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Title taken from this article in GQ. My belief here is that there are, for a majority of the US voting population, very few reasons to vote for the GOP Tradition . People who’ve always voted R , and will continue to do so out of sheer aversion to change. Propaganda . Over the course of decades the Republican party has marketed themselves as fighting for ”the little guy”. When given power however, they have spared no time giving immense tax cuts to the rich something that barely, if at all, helps anyone but the wealthiest. arguing against policies like Medicare for all that would almost certainly save everyday people money. and voted for letting corporations off the hook after screwing over millions of consumers. Open, or non admitted, racism . I have come to believe that a lot of people accept these Republican stances simply because the GOP also institute policies that negatively affect the chances minorities have at finding success or making their voices heard in the democratic system. Of course I understand the need for immigration control, and even though I see little reason to support the current Republican party I also don’t support initiatives such as AbolishICE or 100 open borders. But I do feel that many republicans have crossed a line here, and passed only wanting a ”strong border” to actively voicing blatantly racist ideas. As this is CMV I do truly want my view changed, and the only way that happens is through civil and thoughtful discussion, if your comment is going to consist of nothing but ”darn libtards”, take it elsewhere.<|CONCLUSION|>

But if you were going from one end of the campus to the other without making a large detour, you would have to walk through it , and today I see a giant abortion kills poster on an overpass over our highway during rush hour. How are these graphic posters allowed to be displayed in busy and public areas? For the highway poster, there was a police cruiser with his lights on beside it Im assuming it was either to make sure that the guys with the poster werent going to throw themselves off the bridge, or to help them with the poster and such . Shouldn't I have a choice to NOT view these? I have looked briefly into it and some students HAVE gotten arrested for doing it in areas that weren't approved by the university elsewhere The Pro Life group believes that hiding the posters from public sight is a form of censorship. I'm curious if any of the pictures used in the posters were approved by the families to be used for pro life? How does this respect the families involved? Isn't this similar to posting a picture of a teen suicide and saying Hide your magazines Too much pressure for teens Pro Life supporters also don't care for the situation of the families involved, even if it was a rape case. This baffles me completely. I understand that Pro Life supporters want ALL individuals to have an equal chance at LIFE especially when the individual CANNOT chose to make that decision for themselves, but still. Why do they not put pressure on magazines and other forms of social forces that drive teens into depression and suicide in some cases. Where is the Pro Life in that?

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I guess the easiest way to do this is to itemize it. I had to unsubscribe from r worldnews this week just to get my mind back to a positive place. I don't like feeling this way. Please note, I will quickly get fatigued if everyone tries replying to every item here, and I certainly won't have time to respond to it all if you do, so please feel free to pick whatever issue you feel most comfortable kicking my ass on I'm giving deltas for eliminating any item here. Anyway, here are my main concerns 1 Donald Trump has communicated to our allies that every 4 8 years, they will be playing a game of random chance with whether or not the leader of their largest ally will actually want to be their friend. I think he has communicated this more clearly and provocatively than any president before him in modern times. I think that while our allies are rehearsed and brilliantly composed in terms of understanding how American politics operates, they were not prepared for how drastically the attitude of the nation can change in such a short period of time. As such, in the future, even if the Patron Saint of Progress is our 46, our allies will be very slow, if at all responsive, to friendly diplomacy. I think their efforts to develop stronger economic ties amongst themselves is not only a reasonable response to our adminstration's efforts to instigate a trade war, but a sign of how they hope to operate in the coming decades. 2 I don't think our allies ever \ wanted\ us to be this powerful and they don't mind us being knocked down a few pegs. Even if it means uninstalling our military bases on their soil. I know they would rather us be strong than Russia, but I think their agenda in combating a growing eastern power is going to be to cement their own alliances and leave us out of the equation. Or at least try. I think the majority of the outside world looks at us and thinks this administration represents us. Comments from other countries' citizens like well they fuckin voted for him or good job America just makes me feel like they've condemned us, with no understanding of how virtually impossible it is to get this old world dickcheese out of our congress and out of our White House. 3 Following the Citizens United decision, we've basically just been prescribed a political asspounding until it's overturned. And there's basically no way it's getting overturned. And there's no way we're removing corporate agendas and puppeteering from politics in this decade. 4 Given the divisiveness of American politics, how we struggle to get our own people on board with man made climate change, expanding healthcare coverage, revamping our education system, etc., I don't see how it's possible to get our shit together until basically the incumbent shitsalads and their brainwashed voters all die off or change their minds. No matter what you say or try to do, you will never beat the plurality of a retired 65 year old baby boomer with nothing else to do. 5 We have so many looming crises that require different calibres and types of expertise that we're basically just fucked. We were probably fucked whether or not this administration existed, but we're fucked for sure now. To list a few a growing healthcare costs cripple both citizens' and the armed forces' budgets, and with Big Pharma's tendrils deeply rooted in our economy, that's not changing anytime soon b growing education costs cripple the youngest generations, and unless we institute debt forgiveness on a grand scale, entire generations are doomed to live a lesser life c Russia and China are far more active in installing nuclear reactors we are far behind in terms of getting the country to understand that nuclear Chernobyl, and there is going to be an incoming time of panic when those other two superpowers start installing SMR's all over the world, effectively reconquering it. 6 Our constitution is shit in the modern age. We didn't prepare for a 2 party system where the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branch are all in cahoots. And we didn't prepare for a 2 party system because a 2 party system arrived and they decided not to prepare.<|CONCLUSION|>

There's so much strategy that can come into this but it's being taken away. Example It's been announced that KD won't play for game 2 of the finals. Now Toronto knows not to practice for a fully loaded warriors team. In competitons, every little bit counts. Practicing for KD could make Kawhi just that much more tired and cause him to miss a game winning shot. That's the only one that is fresh on my mind.

However, only a tiny percentage of Christians have ever been exposed to their scriptures in the original language the Bible in Hebrew and Aramaic, and the New Testament in Greek most of them learn it in the vernacular, while some Catholics learn it in the Latin translation, and some Orthodox learn the New Testament in the original Greek and the Bible in the Greek translation. This results in Christians' understanding of their scriptures being limited to the way the translators understood them, and not necessarily the way they were originally written. Of course, it takes time to learn new languages but the same way a scholar of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky would never dream of relying on translated versions and not learning Russian and French for War and Peace so they can understand them in the original context, and a classical historian would never think of studying the works of Herodotus and Suetonius in anything but the original languages, people who base their lives around religious scriptures shouldn't be relying on translations and should study them in their original languages. <|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>For one thing, the way taxes work in the US seems convoluted in general. Why am I getting money back or paying more money at the end of the year? It's just confusing and inefficient, and inefficiencies cost taxpayer money. The taxes on people in the lower income bracket are way too high. I lose almost a quarter of my money before I even see it see Edit 2 below and that money means a lot more to me, as a person who doesn't make a whole lot to begin with, than it does to someone in the upper middle class. An extra 200 400 a month would be a huge deal. The taxes on people in the 1 percent are too easy to circumvent. They hire tax experts and pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to save them money. They must be saving quite a bit of money for that to be worth it. And even if that wasn't the case, higher taxes on them just translates to lower wages to their employees and higher prices on the goods they provide. In contrast, a higher sales tax would be impossible to circumvent, unless you plan on never spending your money. Corporations would no longer have a reason to store their money in banks overseas. I also think the sales tax should be much lower or non existent on necessities such as food and clothing with exceptions for options in those categories that are more luxurious , which would mean that you only pay a lot in taxes if you buy expensive things that you don't really need. And, no tax returns. No ridiculously convoluted tax system. Just a simple, fair tax that taxes the people who are able to pay taxes without it significantly affecting their quality of life. Also, everyone gets more take home pay, which means more spending on goods and services, which means more taxes for the government. It seems to me everybody wins in this scenario. But I must be missing something. Otherwise, why isn't this a more popular idea? Edit I think I should clarify something I was thinking about typical income taxes on salaries and wages when I wrote this post, not things like investment income, which I would still be in favor of taxing. Edit 2 Some people seem quite concerned about the specific numbers, so here, I'll humor the math nerds I make about 30k a year, and my total taxes end up being a little over 20 , which is where I got almost a quarter . This is including Medicare and SS the income tax alone is closer to 12 of my gross income. But, by my calculations, that 12 of 30k per year totals to 300 per month, exactly in line with my 200 400 a month estimate. So please, calm down. Edit 3 I bolded the paragraph about having little or no sales tax on necessities like groceries and clothing, as people seem to be missing that part for some reason. Yes, if that wasn't the case, the poor would be taxed more than the rich. But with my specific plan, they could buy everything they need to continue existing while paying nothing in taxes. This is an essential part of my plan.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Should There be a Universal Basic Income (UBI)?<|ARGUMENT|>Many economists have suggested revenue neutral workable UBI plans that are affordable. For example, the [FairTax version of UBI]( has been studied by economists at the beacon hill institute and in-house economists with various government institutions and concluded that it would be able to cover 30% of the needs at the poverty level with no change to existing welfare programs. If we further assume that some portion of existing welfare programs would be reallocated, that percentage increases.<|CONCLUSION|>

We have driven extinctions of many species and habitats, and are now globally affecting the planet's climate which some scientists predict is the beginning of a mass extinction. We are beginning to seek colonization of other planets, primarily because we fear that Earth may soon be inhospitable. Realistically, we will carry the same habits to other planets and perpetuate the exploitation of native habitat and lifeforms. Our intelligence means we have heightened capacity for suffering. While it's true that we also have a great ability for happiness, can we justify the joy of some for the profound suffering of innocent others? We no longer follow ethics of nature.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I live on the east coast of the United States, in a major metropolitan area. Looking at Detroit as the latest example. In the 1960 s the Supreme Court ruled that the city was unconstitutionally keeping blacks out of white neighborhoods. When this changed, white flight took hold and they left Detroit in droves. It seems to me wherever there are large contiguous populations of blacks that town, city, country is in a desperate state, like Haiti. Even in Africa it is apparent. I don't believe racism can be blamed in all these cases, something else is happening. Why does black mean poverty and sub prime real estate?

Consequently, I kind of want to keep 5 10 in valuable commodities that I can just keep around, and be sure that it won't be wiped out by some sort of investment panic, or a big bank pushing a button.

<|TOPIC|>International Adoption should be banned<|ARGUMENT|>After WWII, United States citizens began adopting children from other countries in large numbers. Between 1971 and 2001, America has adopted far more children internationally than any other country, more than 265,000. According to the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, international adoptions have more than doubled over the past 11 years. [[ Adopted children come from countries all around the world. However, Guatemala, China, Russia and S. Korea make up a large majority. At the same time, the USA is faced with a very serious problem. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services between 1999-2006, an average of 129,884 children are in public foster care every year waiting to be adopted. [[ In 2008, American couples adopted 17,229 children from abroad. This presents our government with a very grim reality. Despite the fact that literally hundreds of thousands of American born children are in need of basic care from real parents, over 17,000 couples ignored this fact and made the decision to adopt children from other counties. We firmly believe that we have a right to help all American citizens, orphans included, before we take into account problems of other nations. At this point, we feel the context is sufficient to state our opening argument. American citizens should be banned from adopting children internationally because currently there is great need for domestic adoption. Nowadays, there are far too many unwanted children domestically in American that need parents to adopt them. As the federal government of the USA, we have the constitutional responsibility to protect the basic rights of our citizens with a higher priority than those of other nations. As we will show below, children in foster care in America are being deprived of their basic rights of equal opportunity and pursuit of happiness. Until this problem is remedied, we cannot justify allowing American couples to meet their adoption needs abroad. As full citizens of the USA, we are determined to do everything within reason to provide these children with an equal opportunity to life a full and happy life. We also believe that adopting internationally has negative and unintended effects and may not be in the best interest of the child. We will discuss this argument in greater detail in our rebuttal. The foster care system in America is under critical stress and in desperate need of more couples willing to adopt. In 2004, ABC news conducted a special report on the nation’s foster care system. Here are some of their findings: 520, 000 kids end up in foster care every year, costing taxpayers $40,000 a head and 22 billion dollars total every year. 40,000 infants are placed in foster care every year. 20% of these kids end up in the system for 5 years are more. But, despite these revealing statistics we saved the most important one for last: “Thirty percent of the homeless in America and some 25 percent of those in prison were once in foster care.” “ [[ These are the forgotten and neglected children of America. Being in foster care, they are deprived of a loving family, an essential element to living a balanced and stable life. They end up in the system for years, taken care of by adults whose only qualifications are that they can provide them with the very basic care of food and shelter. It is not surprising then that they are much more likelihood than any other demographic to end up homeless or in jail. I ask the opposition, how can we allow a single couple to adopt a baby from another country as long as this current problem exists? With such a supply of children needing parents to adopt them, many would wonder why so many American couples choose to adopt kids from overseas in the first place. This is, of course, is at the heart of the issue. If there is any strong opposition, it must be able to give a compelling reason why people should be allowed to adopt internationally. Based on our research, we have listed the most common reasons why people adopt as follows: There is less chance the birth parent will change their mind and try to reclaim the child legally; Less chance the biological parents will try and find their children later in life; There are too many restrictions to adopting domestically and it takes longer. While we do sympathize with these reasons, we do not find any of them compelling. The fact remains that in 2008 there was potentially 17,000 couples who could have adopted domestically but chose to go abroad instead. That means there are 17,000 kids still in the foster care system in American that doesn’t need to be. All 17,000 of those adoption cases would likely not have happened in America. The main reason being that adoption requirements domestically are often stricter than those in other countries. These strict laws regulate and help orphans to find much more qualified parents. Many times, before adopting kids, training classes are required. For example, the state of Kansas requires that prospective parents attend Model Approach to Partnership in Parenting (MAPP) classes. [[ So to deal with the current number of over 1 million children in foster care, the government proposes to have international adoption banned and put our own national domestic problems as the number one priority.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>The released intelligence report states We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President elect Trump. While the secondary goal may have been a preference for a Trump presidency, it makes one question why this would be the case. Russia is no fool, and I believe that they understood a Trump presidency would garner just the results that we see now a wildly unpopular president, at least with both the media and congress, and a much more divided nation. I don't think that anyone could disagree that half of the country that actually cares lost their minds when Trump won. We've seen unprecedented levels of vitriolic rhetoric in regards to his presidency, unprecedented levels of negative media coverage and even an attempt to assassinate republicans Trumps presidency has been overshadowed by scandalous allegations since he was elected, and six months into his term, articles of impeachment have already been introduced Now, much of negative coverage has been of Trump's own doing, but at the same time, I believe that the media focus on scandal is far outweighing and serious reporting on policy, and the Russian's knew that electing a divisive figure like Trump, with no political experience, would lead to exactly what we are seeing play out, a scandal ridden news cycle with nothing but negativity and division. So long as the media continues to focus on scandals and allegations rather than policy and results, and the congress continues to devote resources to investigations rather than legislation, then Russia has succeeded undermining our electoral processes by disrupting the focus of both the american people and the congress by focusing attention away from policy. <|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Affirmative Action was initially established to achieve equity in the workplace however, I think the principle has become too heavy handed and it has added to this PC anti PC culture that is having a major effect on the country USA , including the election of President Trump. I would prefer to keep specific politics out of this CMV. Anyway, AA is referenced by a large proportion of minorities and women. I think the use of AA as a principle of equity is no longer fair to those it does not protect. I believe the equity AA creates in certain situations gives the average generic white male a disadvantage, in some aspects. I think in situations where AA is referenced in terms of hiring a minority over a white male, the use of the AA principle does more harm than good. I mean this as in hiring for a job requiring a degree. I think having a degree automatically places people at an even level, even playing field and thus the hiring of a minority over that of a white male because they are a minority rather than qualifications is unjust and ruins the goal of the AA assuming they are relatively the same in terms of qualifications . In fact, obtaining a degree is important as I believe education is fundamentally the best tool for helping those the AA was intended to help women and minorities . I do not think someone's skin color or sex should determine whether or not they should get an education. I think the acceptance process would be better under a policy regarding socioeconomic class. When pay is brought up, I always try to look at it from an objective standpoint. As a millennial, I feel that what affects peers around me is based more upon socioeconomic status than racial reasons or sex of the person. A big problem I see today is the referencing of the percentage of types of people in leadership administrative roles, such as white males as CEOs. I think the use of this stat is biased. I would much rather feel comfortable if we broke it down by age. I would assume there are a larger number of minorities women taking on roles of CEOs at younger ages than the old white males that are holdovers from previous generations when minorities and women did need AA. My thought process might appear to be all over the place, I apologize. I am merely curious about this topic as it has kind of left me on the fence in terms of its purpose, as current arguments I find to be confusing and biased circular.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Facebook owns both Facebook duhr as well as Instagram. They are THE defacto standard for social media. This is not healthy for anyone. Facebook literally reaches Billions of users. By comparison, Reddit has about 330 million, same for Twitter. Apple doesn't even try. Even mighty Google is shutting down their social media offering in April effectively surrendering the market. The fact that even Google can't compete against FB clearly illustrates that FB is a monopoly. If these tech giants with unlimited resources can't compete, how could literally anyone else? No company regardless of how you feel about Facebook's questionable ethics, and recent revelations about their abuses should own that much of any market. And no one company of this size should be largely guided by thoughts, feelings, and impulses of one man. That leads to things like this Facebook has an 'expansion at all costs' ethos that is dangerous. Granted, this is sort of the ethos of most companies of this size. Their 'break things and fix em later' policy is wreckless for company of their size. They have a propensity to not 'stay in their lane' and just help people connect and share photos of their dinners, but also do things like control how people interact with the media that people consume. The havok that just those behaviors have been bringing is a really good example of exactly why a monopoly is unhealthy. Now, I'm not sure how FB would be effectively broken up. But that was the challenge of breaking up the phone company many years ago. It was done then, and it can be done again. Stiff regulation is another option. Facebook's main product, hyper granular user marketing data is a completely new 'product' that has very little rules outside of privacy laws ones that Facebook seems a bit cavalier with. A discussion about every American's, and all human's actual right to privacy needs to begin. Thanks for reading.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Almost every time when watch videos or look up things like “the funniest tv shows ever”, people are either mentioning community in the comment section or it’s like in the top tier of the funniest tv shows ever. But I really don’t think community is that funny. I love 30 Rock, Arrested Development, The Office US , and to a lesser extent Parks and Recreation. But I just can’t get into community. I really want to, but I can’t. There’s only a few moments or scenes that will make me chuckle and even less moments or scenes that will make me laugh out loud. I also love Rick and Morty which was created by the same guy who made community, but I just can’t get into it. I’ve tried watching the first season at least three times. I tried watching the second season and third season. I looked up “best community episodes” and I watched those, but it’s not really that funny to me. I might put it on if I have nothing else to watch. I think the paintball episodes are really fun. But I just can’t find it as funny as everyone else seems to. I wish someone could change my mind because I really want to find community hilarious, but I just can’t.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I will start by saying that I thoroughly oppose his political views and believe his actions hurt our country from every angle. With his recent decision to remove the United States from the Paris accord he has left the country economically crippled in many ways. Countries will likely impose sanctions on travel and goods on the United states in support of this accord. He has doubled back on most of his campaign promises including building a wall along the Mexican border once he found out that we don't have the resources to do it. He has also failed in passing his immigration ban and his healthcare system. He has succeeded in starting to tear down Title 2 and net neutrality is in jeopardy. He claims responsibility in the economy boom when the bulk of the work was done by the administration prior not by him in any sense. He uses Twitter as his main source of communicating with the public instead of speeches because of his poor public speaking ability and when he does it is clearly written by his staff not him. Huge corporations and even whole states are defying Trump. He has the lowest approval rating of any president ever before. There is no way anyone can effectively represent a country where the majority of people don't approve of him or his actions therefore the smartest action is that he and his cabinet are removed and an emergency election is held to replace it.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Ok so watch the world burn might be a little harsh. It's probably closer to simply hating the status quo so much that eliminating it is more important than anything else. As the candidates put out more and more details regarding their policy plans, there's no doubt Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have almost nothing in common besides their hair issues and a general support for Planned Parenthood. But on the big issues that could have serious impact on the lives of people living in the US immigration, taxes, foreign policy, gun rights, free speech, health care, higher education, and the overall size and scope of the federal government they are close to polar opposites. There's no way that a person who supports Bernie, but who will vote for Trump, is thinking you know I'd like to have free health care and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but I'll settle for continuing with the current health care system and deporting all illegals. But last week, The Guardian asked 700 Bernie Sanders supporters who they would vote for if Hillary wins the nomination and 500 of them said they'd seriously consider Trump while only 200 said they'd vote Hillary. Source This makes absolutely no sense if you consider any of the candidates stances on virtually any issue. So I believe a large percentage of Bernie Sanders supporters don't actually support him for his policies but rather because of what he represents or rather what he doesn't represent . They can't stand the status quo and want to see drastic change more than they want free college or free health care or to see a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Change my view.<|CONCLUSION|>

If the book is being read for school, it's the teacher's job to encourage/manage the discussion about the context.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Germany faces a situation where the major treaty alliance which has protected it or the western half of it at least since the 1940s is in severe peril, and the guarantee of American protection is not as reliable as it once was. Further, with the UK exiting the EU, Germany and France remain the two historical great powers left in that bloc which also has a mutual self defense treaty As the largest and most economically advanced country of the EU, Germany should prepare to position itself as the military leader of Western Europe even absent American global hegemony. With an aggressive and revaunchist Russia to the east, the EU faces a real security threat and should develop the internal means to defeat a Russian invasion. This includes the plausible threat of mutually assured destruction against Russia. Right now, France is about to be the only nuclear weapons state within the EU, and they have IIRC only land based ICBMs which are vulnerable to a first strike. Without a secure guarantee from the US or UK, Germany should focus on developing a strong enough conventional force to stave off Russian aggression in the baltics, as well as a secondary nuclear strike capability probably constituting SLBMs like the UK has. <|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>A tank's job is to keep the team alive and well by tanking damage, right? Rein has a shield Orisa has a deployable barrier D.va has her defense matrix and Zarya has her bubbles other than that, they all have a decent level of armour except zarya and have abilities based around what they can do to help the team overall Roadhog, winston, and specifically wrecking ball have little to no such abilities. The fact of the matter is, they simply weren't designed to tank for the team, they were designed to get kills and tank for themselves Take roadhog, for instance, his only abilities are primary and alt fire, his hook, and his healing Short of bodyblocking for others which they never do , all he does is rack up kills and let his team die WInston, though he has a barrier with a small amount of health, usually plays behind the enemy team killing supports and sometimes snipers. His health drops very quickly and is an overall nuisance for everyone involved. Wrecking ball has zero ability to defend his team other than bodyblocking which, again never happens . his abilities are based around using high mobility and velocity. If his protective barrier was able to give shields to his allies, then he'd have a way of protecting his team directly, but most people just roll around on point or spend half the match above the team, dealing knockup and then immediately dying. Additionally, the tendency of players to charge in alone as hammond can severely hamper a team's efforts to push. Tl dr winston, roadhog and hammond suck. why do they have SO MUCH HEALTH BUT NO WAY TO PROTECT PEOPLE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE change my mind.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>We all know the standard reasons why some people are against religion. But my reason is because teaching a child about religion is basically brainwashing and indoctrination. I say that the only way to eliminate religion is to ban all religious teachings. If a person grows up never learning that such a thing as religion ever existed, religion will be gone in one generation. My plan is simple, just make all children be raised by the State rather than their biological parents, and punish anyone who mentions anything about religion. After all the moronic religious people have died, and the children who know nothing about religion have grown up, we can go back to the parents raising children. Also, books will not have to be burned, because once a child reaches maturity, if they hear that some magical man in the sky created them, they will consider it nothing more than bad science fiction. Please tell me why this is a bad idea.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Ok, first I want to state that I am in no way against gay marriage or homosexuality in anyway. As far as I'm concerned, it's none of my business what two or however many people want to do with each other. If two people or however many decide to get married, then let them. I want to make it clear, I'm not saying it should be illegal, I think it should be legal. I do not, however, think it is a human rights issue. It's not like gay people are being round up and shot or are forced into ghettos. I mean, it's only marriage. As far as I'm aware, there is no universal declaration of the right to marry. To put it another way, polygamy is also illegal in America. I've yet to hear someone say that this is a violation of human rights and yet what's so fundamentally different between this and gay marriage? morally, not technically I personally don't care if polygamy were legal, but I certainly don't consider it a rights issue. TL DR Basically my view is this gay marriage is just as much of a humans rights issue as polygamy is and think the current rhetoric surrounding the issue is way too hyperbolic. Also, I don't see the difference between the two from a moral perspective. I'm not saying either is immoral. Edit a word<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>The cry of 'the end of capitalism' used to be heard emanating only from 'the Left', particularly socialists and communists. In our age, however, the most striking prognostications regarding the imminent collapse of the capitalist mode of production are coming from technologists, who have pointed to the way increased automation, along with a bifurcation of the traditionally interrelated notions of 'use' and 'ownership', are pushing the capitalist system to its breaking point. I believe many of the problems our world is facing, from an over financialized economy that exposes the entire global economy to recurrent crises, to expanding wealth and income inequality both in developed economies and between global North and South, to our planet's environmental crisis not only global climate change, but the loss of biodiversity, pollution, and deforestation as well , are due to capitalism's inability to cope with the changes capitalism itself has brought about technologies that are capable of having effects on orders of magnitude much higher than those who own them can reasonably control, leading both to increasing structural unemployment and to more deleterious negative externalities. However, there is a bright side capitalism has also given rise to extremely powerful and sophisticated means of control and intervention that are rapidly making the notion of 'ownership' irrelevant. Who 'owns' the human genetic code? The obvious answer at least to me is 'no one'. But our genetic code is rapidly becoming one of the most interesting sites of human experimentation and development. Our genetic code can be tampered with and modified without concern for who owns it. This is but one example of what I called earlier the bifurcation of use and ownership. The preceding leads me to conclude that capitalism which, to be clear, I understand not as an ideology but as a mode of production analogous to feudalism before capitalism is on its way out. Now, I don't think that there is an obvious replacement to capitalism already available, and surely whatever comes after capitalism will not be the traditional socialist dream of public i.e. state ownership of the means of production. Just like certain elements of feudalism have carried over into the capitalist age, I see no reason why post capitalism would require the wholesale abandonment of private property or some forms of capital concentration and even social classes. But, at least to my lights, the current configuration of the world economy around capital and its increase is stifling the further development of that economy and so will become replaced by a new engine of progress. What that would be, I must admit, is beyond my ken. It is this ignorance that leads me to be skeptical of my own contention, and the reason why I've chosen to pose this question of this subreddit. Change my view. Edit lots of confusion in the comments concerning the definition of capitalism and the precise question I'm trying to ask. The obscurity was mine, I apologize. a Capitalism is the mode of production centered around a regime of capital accumulation b My contention is that capital accumulation is no longer functioning appropriately, i.e. in a manner capable of reproducing society as a whole, in as much as this social reproduction is necessary for the continued expansion of capital.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>During his commencement speech at Howard University, President Obama was quoted as saying the following gt “That’s a pet peeve of mine – people who have been successful and don’t realize they’ve been lucky,” he said. “That God may have blessed them it wasn’t nothing you did. So don’t have an attitude.” I have several problems with this message. While I generally agree with part of the sentiment success is part work part luck circumstance whatever you want to call it , I don't believe that this is actually a good sentiment to reinforce. This message disincentivizes hard work by reminding people that hard work alone might not equate to success. It offers comfort to those who have not been successful regardless of their actual effort level by redirecting responsibility to this invisible force that they cannot control. It wasn't nothing you did is a logical extension of the you didn't build that speech. I didn't have a problem back then because of the context. But with this additional context, a troubling pattern is emerging. Instead of hammering the part luck part work narrative, he seems to be doubling down on all just luck . My opinion is that when speaking to anyone, and especially the disenfranchised, this kind of speech is far more harmful than an insensitive phrasing, a joke, or a blunt, misguided opinion. Insensitive speech hurts a groups feelings. The President's speech can wrongly alter behavior. Thus, the reaction to each kind of speech seems backwards to me. The most important part of this CMV is that I don't need to be convinced that success typically involves luck outside of your control. I need to be convinced that we are benefited more than we are harmed by reminding everyone that success is out of your control.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>College entry standardized testing is designed to see if you can read, use logic, compute, demonstrate mastery of the English language, comprehend, write, and use basic mathematical and literary intuition and skills quickly and accurately. If you can't do one of these things, it should be reflected in your score because that is what the test is trying to show colleges. Whether you can't read quickly because you are dyslexic, you can't focus well, or you just aren't good at reading doesn't seem to be of that much relevance to the purpose for which colleges want test scores, which is presumably to see if you have the abilities and skills necessary to succeed in their classes. A common argument seems to be that these skills aren't important and mastery of them doesn't indicate people who have great ideas, are driven, or will succeed in college or life. This is absolutely true, but then we should get rid of this style of standardized testing altogether instead of punishing students who have minor problems testing quickly and giving accommodations to those with huge problems testing quickly. If colleges want this information and College Board and the ACT have agreed to give it to them, they should at least give it to them accurately or have an asterisk or letter accompanying the scores to reflect the unusual testing conditions. If you are illiterate for any reason, colleges should be told that in some form on a test of reading speed and ability. If you get the questions read out loud to you and answer verbally, which is not an uncommon accommodation at my school, colleges should see that information along with your score. Especially on the ACT, where the questions are fairly simple and time is often the main factor in the reading comprehension and science sections, extra time, getting questions read to you at your own pace, and even in some cases unlimited time are enormous benefits that can lead to perfect scores. Percentile is hugely important in SAT and ACT scores and affects and outlying scores affect everyone's score. The main problem with accommodations based on learning disabilities is that it is hugely class based and leads to more unfair advantages and opportunities for cheating for privileged kids with pushy parents. As a student at a fairly elite private school where a majority of kids are applying to highly selective universities and almost half of the student population gets accommodations of some kind on standardized tests, I hear kids and parents talking all the time about strategies to get accommodations, a process that requires a lot of time and money from involved parents concerned with college admissions, attentive teachers in small classes, tutors, and school learning specialists and college counselors, none of which are available to many kids in this country, many of whom probably have real learning problems that go undiagnosed. Many kids in my class have perfect 2400s or 36s earned with accommodations, and a huge percentage of the kids at my school have accommodations of some sort. In some parts of the country, the SAT is treated as a literacy test for state or community college admission, and yet in my extremely wealthy community, kids get questions read out loud to them if they read slower than the average kid their age. It doesn't make sense to me. I can't help feeling that this system isn't fair, it's biased against kids and families who need the most help, and it prevents the standardized test from doing its job. I'm starting to feel really guilty about this, though, and I think it probably is coming from the frustration of the standardized test process. Please change my view, reddit.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>Age Of Criminal Responsibility Should Be Raised<|ARGUMENT|>Children do not have the emotional maturity to be responsible in law for their actions. We all know that children cannot always make informed decisions. It is for this reason that children in many countries cannot vote or drink alcohol or consent to sex. Children have not had enough experience of life and do not yet have the same mental and emotional abilities as adults. They are often not aware of the consequences of their actions. Even where they know the difference between right and wrong, they often don't understand the difference between various levels of wrongdoing. It is therefore unfair to hold them criminally responsible for these actions.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>To start the FCC's new rules are Not final but this is from their blog That all ISPs must transparently disclose to their subscribers and users all relevant information as to the policies that govern their network That no legal content may be blocked and That ISPs may not act in a commercially unreasonable manner to harm the Internet, including favoring the traffic from an affiliated entity. When I read these it seems to be the opposite of what Reddit says will happen. First off the new laws require ISP's to disclose all information about how they govern their network. This can lead to a new level of transparency and allow us to really see what we are paying for. It also means you can see if any ISP's are negatively effecting your favorite websites service Even though this would be illegal under the new laws, see below . People argue for more transparency in corporations and this will bring just that. No legal content may be blocked, I don't believe anyone is against this rule and it prevents situations such as Turkey and Syria where governments have blocked major websites. The last rule is the most important. All deals for fast lanes need to be reviewed by the FCC so they are not commercially unreasonable. This also guarantees that all internet traffic must be provided at a baseline service level, with some companies paying to provide a better level of service. This does not allow discrimination Specifically outlawed and means that companies that use more bandwidth can pay to maintain better connections. This could also prevent throttling of service, as all traffic must be provided at a baseline level Which needs to be determined but I would like to see it guaranteed at the service level you pay for . Websites with low traffic and funds do not need to pay for a fast lane, and there will be a point where a company finds it economically feasible to pay for increased service. Some have complained that this will increase prices, but it can also increase service levels of your favorite website. I would gladly pay an extra 1 2 a month for better Netflix. We could also benefit from faster free services such as Youtube and Skype. To further my point above why shouldn't ISP's be able to charge more for better service. Like they charge customers more for faster and more usage should ISP's not be able to treat companies like their consumers? I can't think of an industry that doesn't charge more for better service and I believe if the carrier is offering better service to the company they should be allowed to charge more. Especially if the extra costs are used to improve last mile service. Overall I think the Knee Jerk reaction of reddit has really hindered the discussion about the benefits of these laws. Talk has centered around potential negative effects, instead of looking at how we can improve these laws, if they need improving. From what I gather from the FCC's proposal I see more transparency from ISP's, protection against censorship, new laws to protect against throttling and discrimination, and improved network speeds for the most popular websites. Change my view.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Louis CK was recently accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, where he exposed himself and masturbated in front of several woman, who were shocked, confused, or disturbed by his behavior. While this behavior is certainly inappropriate and distasteful, he never actually forced these women to watch, and he didn't have any physical contact with the women. If they wanted to, they could have left the room at any time or told him to stop. He might have been in a position of power, but these women still had free will regardless. Because of what he did, his entire career has ended. All of his film, television, and stand up projects have been cancelled. He has admitted that he was wrong and has given what seems to be a heartfelt apology. He is one of the greatest living comedians and his style of brutally honest, self reflective comedy has had a positive impact on millions of fans. Therefore, his career should be allowed to continue. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>There are reams of evidence supporting the fact that institutional racism and its effects, particularly targeting black Americans, still exist in the United States. Yet some people persist in claiming that institutional racism is gone. So I thought I would compile some evidence. Economics Wealth housing One area where we can see this is with wealth. The median black family has twenty times less wealth than the average white family. Much of this disparity is the result of institutionalized housing discrimination, called redlining. 2011 research from Brandeis university found that gt The number of years families owned their homes was the largest predictor of the gap in wealth growth by race Figure 2 . Residential segregation by government design has a long legacy in this country and underpins many of the challenges African American families face in buying homes and increasing equity. There are several reasons why home equity rises so much more for whites than African Americans gt Because residential segregation artificially lowers demand, placing a forced ceiling on home equity for AfricanAmericans who own homes in non white neighborhoods6 gt Because whites are far more able to give inheritances or family assistance for down payments due to historical wealth accumulation, white families buy homes and start acquiring equity an average eight years earlier than black families7 gt Because whites are far more able to give family financial assistance, larger up front payments by white homeowners lower interest rates and lending costs and gt Due to historic differences in access to credit, typically lower incomes, and factors such as residential segregation, the homeownership rate for white families is 28.4 percent higher than the homeownership rate for black families This discrimination is a product of government policy. Boston University historian David Lyons explains that gt In fact, federal policies promoted racial segregation. Consider housing. In the 1930s, federal agencies embraced the practice of redlining, which disqualifies applicants in African American and transitional neighborhoods from home purchase and home improvement In fact, federal policies promoted racial segregation. Consider housing. In the 1930s, federal agencies embraced the practice of redlining, which disqualifies applicants in African American and transitional The process of housing discrimination continued on into the 1980's Jobs Identical job applications with black sounding names get calls back 30 less than white sounding names. In bad economic periods, black people are fired before other people Black workers receive extra scrutiny from bosses, which can lead to worse performance reviews, lower wages, and even job loss. Criminal justice Black Americans are oppressed by our criminal justice system. White and black people use marijuana at the same rate, but black people about 3.5 times more likely to be arrested for it White people are more likely to deal drugs, but black people are more likely to be arrested Crack cocaine more common with black users carries harsher penalties than powder cocaine more common with white users . For murders with white victims, black people get executed 15 times more than white people, even though 82 of white victims are killed by white people. The end result of racism in criminal justice is that America now incarcerates black people at a higher rate than Apartheid South Africa. Voting Since 1982 and 2014, the Department of Justice overruled 2,400 racist voting laws policies in 10 states. See examples here pp. 46 48 Voter ID laws disenfranchize one in nine voters disproportionately black and hispanic In 2006, the Supreme Court found that Texas drew legislative districts in order to decrease minority voting power With all of this research, no one should be able to claim that institutional racism doesn't exist.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I believe that socialism is better than capitalism. The basis of capitalism is that the hard working have a comfortable life and the non hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard only to scrape by. In socialism, every single person has a relatively equal income. I'm not talking about Communism in which there is no currency or ownership, but a market in which everyone is free to spend but the poor are uplifted and the rich are taxed. According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life, can you please try to CMV and offer good arguments for the benefits of capitalism? EDIT Thank you for all your answers and apologies for not being so clear. You have all definitely showed me the pros to capitalism, and helped me remove the connotation of socialism to a perfectly equal society.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>common opinion of many Americans is that the Iraq war was wrong and George Bush is a war criminal for it. When you look at the recent events leading up to it I think the war was well within reason. Saddam Hussein first rose to power then began fighting the Iranians and that was ok because they were our enemies. Then he proceeds to genocide an ethnic minority in his own country killing 182,000 Kurds during one campaign, utilizing weapons of mass destruction . After this he starts a war with a sovereign nation and occupies it. Not comparing him to Hitler but he was very similar with his atrocities military invasions. If the world is serious about never again and not allowing genocides, wouldn’t it be moral to remove the regime responsible for such atrocities who continued active genocide up to 2003. Not to mention Iraq was being run as a fascist state that regularly kidnapped,tortured and massacres any dissenters supposed dissenters. The military invasion of Iraq may have been started on false pretenses WMD’s but it did remove a regime that is an Arab version of the 3rd Reich like seriously you have a military dictatorship, genocide, police state, one party rule, regular massacres, propaganda centered around a charismatic strongman, invasions of neighboring states The US was then forced to be the reigning government and occupying force. There were Baathist members joining insurgent groups, old sectarian feuds exploding because the Baathist rule was now gone and there was that unfortunate bombing of that important mosque. We removed a genocidal dictatorship and then were forced to keep a dysfunctional country under control. It was unfortunate a large scale insurgency happened and many died as a result but were not entirely responsible for that forming, we just had to fight it. We even eventually formed a democratic government who still ruled today. There are still issues but not at the same scale. Tl dr the Iraq war removed an Arab 4th Reich and unfortunately fought a large war. The handling might have been botched but it was noble and we really were toppling an evil government.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>This is obviously related to the killing of Daniel Shaver. If you haven't already, you can witness the footage here viewer discretion advised My argument is that no cop should be allowed to kill a man because the cop felt threatened. Killing a person should be the absolute last resort, when the situation is imperative and no other action is possible. An act like that cannot be based on feelings of threat. Judge jury cannot order a person to be executed just because they have a bad feeling about him. The conviction has to be based on evidence. Same here, even though response time is much shorter. Feeling is not enough, for two reasons Feelings can be influenced by a number of things. What if you slept really badly the night before? What if you had an argument with your wife and she said she wants a divorce? What if another vehicle nearly hit you on the way to the crime scene? Lot of things can influence how we feel, not merely what is happening at the scene. Feelings can also change rapidly. There is no way to prove a feeling. Only I truly know what I feel, no matter what I project to outside. It's extremely difficult, if not impossible, for others to prove I did not feel what I later swear I felt. If I am allowed to do what I want because of the way I feel, no one could hold me accountable for anything. All necessary punishments should be based on verifiable evidence and the punishment should fit the crime. But what if the person does not respond appropriately to orders? You know, like Daniel Shaver. Well, honestly there could be a number of reasons for that for example he might be drunk, on drugs, panicking having a breakdown, mentally handicapped or simply does not understand English well. Because reasons other than he is going to kill us exist, there needs to be at least another factor, like the suspect being verbally aggressive and threatening. I should not be killed just because I had a twitch on my leg and the cop had a stressful day. Not even if I reach to pull up my pants. If I am not armed, I pose no threat and ANY fatal shot is not justified. How can cops know if I can pose harm? Either by my aggressive behavior or witnessing the presence of a gun. But then the cops get shot right? No. The likelihood for that might increase, sure, but the likelihood for innocent person getting shot needlessly also vastly decreases. At worst, it's a zero sum game. At best, the society at large benefits, with fewer people dead. Also, I have to note that a cop that has his gun already out and pointed at the suspect, has a huge advantage in response time. It takes 0.5 seconds or less to pull the trigger. For the other to reach and pull out a gun, extend their shooting arm, aim and pull the trigger, it takes about 2 3 seconds. Odds simply favor the cop. So cop deaths might not even increase, even if cops have to wait an additional second to identify a gun. Nevertheless, in all scenarios the appropriate action should be the action of least harm. Frisking, restraining, detaining, taser, warning shot or non lethal shot first. Fatal shot should be the absolute last resort, when others are not available. Daniel Shaver should have been frisked and detained when he was on the ground. The cops outnumbered him 3 to 1, had their guns ready and he was unable to harm anyone when on the ground, hands over his head. Result from his non compliance should not have been a fatal shot. Maybe no first shots policy would be too much, but at least cops should not be able to shoot until the threat weapon has been verified to exist. Having a feeling of threat is not enough. Sudden twitches or movements towards waistband or glove compartment are not enough, as the suspect might be unable to rationally think about what his actions look like to a stressful cop. And even then, shots should be non lethal maybe use rubber bullets first and foremost, until all the other options have been exhausted or impossible. I don't think this is the case nowadays. Same goes for me, or anyone really. I cannot beat up a guy, just because his presence threatens me. Not even if his hand is in his pocket. If he threatens me verbally or non verbally like getting extremely close and touching me , I would should be allowed to do the action of least harm to protect myself. But even then I definitely should not be allowed to kill him as my first instinct . Only if I know for sure that my life is in mortal danger, and it's my life or his. Police should follow the same rules, pretty much. The bottom line I cannot be thrown into jail for robbery, if I was literally unable to rob that bank, no matter what the police thinks . And likewise, I cannot be shot to death, if I was unable to pose a serious threat, no matter what police thinks . And the fact is that if I face 2 3 armed police officers, my unarmed ass simply poses no threat to them. Just because they feel I might be dangerous or armed is not enough to sign my death warrant. Nor is death appropriate punishment for my failure to comply with all of their orders. EDIT Lot of good responses, no time to reply to them all. Thanks regardless <|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>ban animal testing<|ARGUMENT|>23 new drugs are introduced each year in the United Kingdom alone .[1]. While almost all of these drugs will have been brought to the market after extensive animal testing, the number of animals used to check their safety only seems to be a high cost when the benefits that each drug brings to its users are inadequately considered. New drugs that are approved for medical use have the potential to relieve human pain and suffering not only for the first group of patients given access to them, but also for future generations of sick and suffering individuals too. Consider all the lives, all over the world, that have benefitted from penicillin since its discovery in 1928. If drugs cost more to research and develop, then that reduces potential profit margins, and some drugs that would have otherwise been discovered and released will fall below the new threshold of likely profits necessary to fund the research. Adopting this proposition will lead to more people suffering and dying in the future than would have otherwise been the case. [1] BBC News. 2013. Falling drug breakthroughs 'a myth'. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I was in a relationship for 5 years. We got engaged. And then about a month after that, she told me that she had been seeing some other guy, and that she was leaving me to go be with him. I've heard it said many times that the best relationships work when you are friends for a good amount of time first. And that has certainly shown itself to be true in my life and the people I know. Every one of my friends who is in a relationship, has been in that relationship 15 years. And every one of my friends that isn't in a relationship is the exact opposite. They get in and out of relationships all the time and nothing substantial and meaningful meaningful in my own opinion. everyone has their own meaning of course is ever established. The guy my ex left me for, let's call him Al she knew him before she met me. Which is probably what hurt me the most. They had been friends a long time, and she ended up leaving me for him. The hard part to accept about that is that before she had met me, she had been in a very abusive relationship where the guy would not only cheat on her constantly, but beat the shit out of her on a regular basis. It was very difficult in the beginning because she had serious emotional and mental issues. But I stuck with her because I loved her. Where was Al when she was going through that depression? Where was Al when she was crying because it was too sunny outside? I don't know. But I was there, loving her and supporting her. Because of what happened in her past, I wrongly assumed that she, of all people in the world, would never cheat on me. I was wrong. My sister, who got married with a guy after only 2 years, is now divorced after only a year of marriage. I have no female friends. Never mind any that would want to be in a relationship with me. It's been over a year since she left me, and I have yet to even get a date with someone else. As far as I can tell, women my age either 1 already have something established or 2 aren't looking for long term relationship. I am going to die alone. Please, please, please change my view on this, as it has left me extremely depressed and suicidal.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>All throughout reddit, any discussion of climate change is accompanied by studies and citations claiming that all hope is lost. There is absolutely nothing that I can do though I don't have a car and have vowed to never have children, which are probably the biggest two things you can do for the planet and I cannot live in the best case scenario society All my entertainment is derived from technology, most people don't like my deep topics of conversation and I cannot reach their level I don't care about sports, I don't care about the weather, I don't care about irrelevant events in the lives of others . I don't even like group activities. I will not be able to stand having to spend most of the day farming and hanging out with people I find utterly uninteresting. Since I am such a loner I am utterly incapable of surviving a disaster scenario. Therefore, my best course of action is to live a solitary existence. I don't plan for the future since there is no future. Why get into debt to buy a house, since it will be worth nothing? Why plan for a long term career, since it will all collapse? Why raise a family, since it will be people I will have to defend and likely see slaughtered and raped in front of me, all cursing my name for not being able to defend them? If there is no hope, why should I expect a tomorrow? I don't want to go out fighting, I see no point on it. I might as well just stay in my room and play videogames until the apocalypse and finally hang myself when the time comes. Why not follow this plan?<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>As far as I can remember, university admissions have always put great emphasis on their applicants demonstrating their leadership abilities, as if having leadership qualities are the most important to society and the most important metric to indicate future success. gt Harvardʼs application informs students that its mission is “to educate our students to be citizens and citizen\ leaders for society.” Yaleʼs website advises applicants that it seeks “the leaders of their generation” on Princetonʼs site, “leadership activities” are first among equals on a list of characteristics for would\ be students to showcase. Even Wesleyan, known for its artistic culture, was found by one study to evaluate applicants based on leadership potential. This is flawed for several reasons Not everyone can be a leader. In any leadership hierarchy, there are only so many spots at the top. Yes, leaders, are important, but you also need followers as well. Not everyone wants to be a leader. Some people such as my self, have no desire to be leaders, and are comfortable following someone else's lead. Some people are perfectly happy being a producer in their craft and contributing, without taking the lead. It penalizes people for having certain personality types. Leaders tend to be more extroverted and outgoing, so requiring leadership qualities penalizes people with more introverted personalities. There are other important and meaningful ways to contribute to society and be successful without being a leader. Steve Jobs may have lead Apple and had the vision, but that company would have never been successful without all the work and contributions behind the scenes, many of whom may have no had leadership roles. It leads to an unhealthy rat race in high school. With college admissions being so competitive, many high schoolers will overwhelm themselves trying to take on as many leadership roles as possible to try and be able to stand out from the rest. Once again, this ignores the fact that students can have other non\ leadership qualities that can still be valuable to society. Leadership isn't the only indicator of future success. There could be a a brilliant artist or writer or engineer with a lot of great potential who gets looked over because they don't have a lot of leadership qualities to talk about on their application. TL DR \ Leadership qualities are not the only indicators of future success, and are certainly not the only things that are valuable to society. Therefore university admissions should stop putting so much emphasis on leadership as an admissions criteria. Just because someone isn't a leader doesn't mean they don't have value to society or to an employer. EDIT 1 It penalizes less affluent kids, because they will likely have less opportunity to take leadership roles in school activities, because they will often have to spend more time after school working a menial job to help pay the bills, or their less well funded school system just may not provide as many extra\ curricular activities.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I want to preface this by saying I'm not interested in being psychologised. I hold this view for the following reasons The level of suffering in the world is too great, and vastly outweighs that of the pleasure. Despite admirable strides in human progress i.e modern medicine there are still too many issues plaguing the earth and humanity wherein suffering is too prevalent en masse. Very briefly, there is still absolute poverty, factory farming, warfare, etc. And then debilitating personal struggles, loss of loved ones, poor mental health, etc. What's more, animals in their state of nature suffer enormously. Their lives are brutish, and harsh, death in the natural world is often a slow process consisting of succumbing to infection, starvation, or gruesome deaths by predators or natural conditions. I would further justify this argument, through reference to Benatar's asymmetry, which I would love to see retort to, because I see it as almost iron clad. The asymmetry says that procreation, and thus existence, is undesirable because Existence Presence of pain bad Present of pleasure good Non existence Absence of pain good . Because Absence of pleasure neutral . Because no one is being deprived of pain. By not pressing the button, I would also be permitting humanity to continue forth on the path to progress, ensuring that even more suffering is inflicted upon future generations. <|CONCLUSION|>

Whether it's clothes, or a new phone, or anything that you've been looking forward to, finally clicking confirm purchase is immensely satisfying. This, of course, leads to your product being shipped from some warehouse to your door. You are often given a tracking number, so that you can follow your package across the world, step by step. But in truth, that ruins the experience. The anticipation of the package is a huge part of the enjoyment of the entire enterprise. When will it arrive? Today? Or the next day? There's a great Calvin and Hobbes comic about this exact concept the stress and emotion we give to the day's mail. But when we utilize the tracking number, the magic is lost. The unpredictability vanishes. We are reminded of the depressing fact that no, we don't actually make anything in this company any more, and even the necessary shipping facilities stateside aren't in our town part of the reason it and its economy suck so much. But when we ignore the tracking number, we say no to structure and the tyranny of knowing. We revive the magical qualities of our wait for the mail. Will my shirts be shipped in two packages or one? Will the arrive on different days? Where did they come from? Our lack of answers to these eternal questions catalyzes creativity and inspires imagination. Join me, as I wait for my most recent online orders, and say no to tracking numbers. Join the renaissance.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>As part of a years long contract dispute, the NJ transit public union is considering a strike that would shut down NJ transit train service. NJ transit trains are a vital piece of local infrastructure, and shutting them down would create a huge debacle edit not a boondoggle not only for the 100,000 people who is it so commute daily, but also those who would be hurt by the incredible traffic jams that will result from 10,000 additional cars on the road. It is estimated to cost the area millions and millions of dollars every hour . see here for a lot of this info . In short, these union workers are holding the local economy hostage as part of their negotiations. They should not be permitted to do so. This is very different than a private union negotiating with a business. Here it is not some company's money that is at stake, but the welfare of the general public. How would this ban be implemented? There should be a bill banning public unions from using threats to shut down vital services as part of contract negotiations. It would not become a criminal or civil offense to strike, but the NJ transit authority would have the freedom to fire any individual employee on the spot with cause, without appeal and without benefits to the employee. Yes, this would reduce the union's bargaining power. But it should , IMO. They are using power they should not have in their negotiations the power to hurt the common good. This would not render public unions toothless. They could still negotiate contracts as a collective. They could call for outside arbitration. They could still have a say in new hirings and firings. They could still work via public advocacy and get out the vote campaigns. They could do partial work stoppages that do not lead to shutting down the services for example, many ticket collectors and sellers could strike, costing the agency ticket money but still running the trains . Edit Such a change would not happen in isolation, and steps would be taken to insure that municipal unions retain their ability to function. Consider New York state's Taylor Law which bans most municipal unions from striking. However, provisions are in place that are beneficial to unions, such as mandatory outside arbitration and the fact that in the absence of a new contract, the previous contract is automatically extended including pay raises. Municipal unions covered by this law have in general done quite well in New York. They also have substantial influence in state and NYC politics to advocate for themselves.<|CONCLUSION|>

The finale didn't provide that much closure it didn't clear up the whole Despereaux thing and Gus and Rachel breaking up was really badly thought out and I thought it would be explained in the finale. Lassiter's and Henry Spencer's stories don't have a definite conclusions and it seems like the writers just skipped over them. The focus was really on Shawn rather than on any other character.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>First off, for those of you living under a rock I am referring to the proposed wall between the US and Mexico. Secondly, I am not at all a Trump supporter, this is one of 3 policies of his that I agree with. Anyways, the biggest argument I have heard about not building the wall is that it won't stop illegal immigration because most illegal immigrants come in on planes and or outstay their visas. However the way I see it human trafficking and drug trafficking are some of the biggest issues and those can't occur on planes. Smuggling drugs on planes is very difficult, especially in large quantities, and you need a passport to go on a plane so human trafficking also cannot be done on planes. That leaves driving across the border where, in many spots there really is no border wall of any kind. I think we have all heard horror stories of human trafficking so I won't get into that, and drug trafficking would be greatly reduced although not stopped. Illegal immigration would also be reduced and it would add more risk to traffickers by making it way more likely to be caught. I understand that this would be very expensive but I think it would be worthwhile. Also I wrote this on mobile but I will edit it when I get a chance. Edit I have changed my view thanks mostly to u shitferbrains55. I still maintain that we need more border security, but I think that due to ecological and financial reasons a wall does not make sense. I think armed guards and drones would be more effective and efficient. Thank you all for the great respons<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>People arguing for against capitalism and socialism tend to do so from a pure economic perspective. Browse just about any debates on CMV or other websites and you'll see how one sided each debate is. The debate between socialism and capitalism whether it is a casual debate on the Internet or especially a serious debate in politics should rather discuss the efficacy and inefficacy of multiple elements from both economic systems. History alone proves that too much of anything is bad . A successful economy derives from a mixture of both socialism and capitalism. How so? That's because happiness is an indicator of how successful an economic system is. Look at Norway or Denmark though often misinterpreted as countries of socialist paradise, they are countries that have successfully integrated capitalist and socialist policies. In turn, people who live under a more mixed diverse economy tend to be much more happier than those whose country leans further towards one side of the economic spectrum. Based on that premise, people and I mean a significant portion of a country's population who have experienced misery have done so because of a nearly pure economic system, whether through the means of wealth inequality poverty e.g., 19^th century America or dictatorial rule e.g., under Stalin's rule Unless people are willing to submit to these types of pure economic systems, then there is no point in debating which economic system is superior.<|CONCLUSION|>

They use drugs or have other addictions in a similar way, to get through life without going insane. Now, I'd like to stop being so cynical about how I view drinking drug use, but I just can't seem to let it go, because I hate seeing people be dishonest with themselves and give in to the society trap we are living in If people were happy with their lives, why would they need to drink?

<|TOPIC|>Capitalism vs socialism<|ARGUMENT|>The first assumption is that socialism is a statist society. This is completely false: as socialism (at its core) is a classless society where workers own the means of production it is very rare (if impossible) that socialism could be a state society - there are exceptions (such as Kerala, Bolivia, etc.) but that is because they are transitioning towards socialism, and in doing so are gradually taking away state power and putting it in the hands of the people. The second assumption is that stateless socialism can only exist in pre-industrial societies, a lá the ideas of Zerzan and other primitives. This blatantly false: the largest and best example of a socialist society was the spanish revolution, which was an industrial society, and most ideas for socialist societies (such as Prouhon's Mutualism; Bakunin's Collectivism; Kropotkin's Anarchist Communism; Bertrand Russell's Guild Socialism; Pannekoek's Council Communism; Rocker's Anarcho-Syndicalism; Albert's and Hahnel's Parecon; Shalom's Parpolity; and others') have been for industrial societies. So both assumptions that the argument that socialism could harm the environmnt are erroneous.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>You’re probably thinking “if you don’t date someone because of their race you’re a racist ” And it’s simply not true. You can’t control your physical attraction and that’s what makes you interested in people, it’s not necessarily a conscious decision. It’s unfair to shame people for trying to be happy with a consenting person within the law. I’ve seen so many instances where people are shaming women for only wanting 6’ tall men, but no one shames men for wanting a woman with a pretty face. Being logically consistent if it’s not wrong to like someone because of their face, then it isn’t because of their height, and it isn’t wrong because of their race, or their age of lawful age of course or their transgender status or their wealth and so on. If not wanting to date someone because of their race, transgender status, wealth etc. is wrong then we might as well date the first person we see.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>hold all U.S. presidential primaries on the same day.<|ARGUMENT|>Immense pressure is placed on candidates to win in the early primaries and then to deliver repeat performances across “key” states. Each stage of the process is effectively a national campaign and has to be treated- and funded - as such. Even though votes in primaries are limited to the citizens of individual states, or the members of state parties, the media can communicate a poor showing in the polls or a blunder in a debate to the entire nation. The overall cost of running campaign adverts, researching a candidate’s position on a huge range of local issues and organising rallies, debates and press briefings can quickly become astronomical– hence the need to establish as decisive lead as early as possible. A single national primary would both reduce costs and provide for a clearer result. Moreover, a single national primary would compel candidates to mount campaigns based around positive policy statements and direct involvement in issues local to states. The role of attack campaigning- aimed at undermining opponents with an early lead- would be de-emphasised. To give these practical benefits some context we should consider the 2008 campaign for the democratic party nomination. By the end of primary season, Obama and Clinton between them had raised nearly a quarter of a billion dollars. Obama won on paper, but the campaign had been dominated by the differing perspectives of two figures who would go on to be President and Secretary of State. It can hardly be in the interest of party of national unity to know that the Secretary of State thinks the President lacks the experience to receive a late night phone call concerning an international crisis.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>At 21, most people are outside of parental supervision, at college, or hopefully living on their own I know this is an unattainable reality for some Millennials, the perspective is still valid for a large chunk of the populace . I believe that it is critical that a youth learn 'the right way' to drink. I know this sounds a little silly to some of you, please reserve judgment until the end of this post. I see so many people who just hammer themselves drink after drink until they feel blitzed enough. And as many of you experienced drinkers know, you're usually 1 or 2 drinks over where you want to be when it starts to hit you, if you slam them one after another. Most of the time it is a strange peer one upsmanship contest that nobody wins. On the other hand, most of the people that I see that moderate their intake responsibly, slowly ramping up to their 'dancing optimum' where your inhibitions are just weak enough to let you loose, but still around enough to keep you from snorting a line of Finishing Sugar off of the rim of your margarita. And in most circumstances, those people that drink responsibly were indoctrinated in the responsibilities of drinking at home by their parents. I know its common knowledge that parents may occasionally give their older kids a sip of wine or beer, and most people really don't have an issue with this provided it isn't some whackjob parent buying six packs for sleepovers. On the other hand, when the drinking age was 18, many families I knew made it a point to be around for their newly drinking legal offspring's first few benders. Important lessons were learned in these early years. Pacing Quality assessment 'Beer Goggle' resistance In most similar perspectives, it is the gentle and sometimes not so gentle embarrassment of family members that are trusted that guide the youth into proper drinking patterns. Without that guidance, drinking patterns are based upon personal experience and peer encouragement. In the modern day 21 college frat party culture, there are fewer social controls or mentor structures in place, resulting in a larger number of people who become adults without really having a grasp of consumption moderation. I volunteer at a non profit drug rehab, and I see literally thousands of alcoholics come through our doors every year. I get a chance to hear most of their stories. Most of them started young, 12 14. And they started hardcore, and never really stopped, and never learned to stop, and never learned why they even would want to stop. And they never had a chance to have guidance from their family on how not to be stupid in consumption. So, I feel that by raising the legal drinking age to 21, and stigmatizing alcohol awareness training from parents, we have created a great swell in the number of alcoholics that need treatment to get their lives back on track.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>A Joe Rogan video hit the top of r videos a few days ago and the comment thread prompted this CMV. In general reddit loathes the body positive movement because in my opinion they don't like unattractive women thinking they're attractive. This is what the issue is really about to me. People say it will encourage women to be obese or we should encourage women to lose weight for the health benefits but i don't buy any of that. No one aims to be obese, it just happens because we live in a stressful alienating world and some people deal with it by eating. No one cares that our media is filled with obese men. And most importantly, this has nothing to do with health. Being obese isn't good for your health but neither is millions of things like smoking or energy drinks or sitting in front of a computer your whole life. In fact if you're obese you don't even need to necessarily lose all your weight to become healthy, and having the aim of losing lots of weight is often a poor strategy. If you aim to exercise and diet so you don't put on any weight, and talk to a doctor or dietician, you'll become pretty healthy while still being chunky. More than this it's not just about hating fat women. It's fat women who think they're attractive is what really gets people angry. And why? Beauty is entirely subjective, many unhealthy habits like smoking can be seen as attractive, and thinking of yourself as beautiful is often a positive thing. So what's the problem here? Is it because they're seen as liars? Many obese women are seen as beautiful by certain people. People rarely react by saying some might find you beautiful but personally from my subjective view I would disagree it's almost always you're not beautiful or No one thinks you're beautiful which is entirely unverifiable. It seems like transparent policing of women's bodies to me. So if there's a reasonable way to hate body positivity that isn't revolved around being repulsed by fat women I'm all ears.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I'll preface this by saying that I view Wall Street and investment banking with a contempt few professions inspire, for a wide variety of reasons. After the 2008 crisis, my view was that I'd gladly see half of Wall Street in jail and the other half subject to enough regulation to make Dodd Frank look like a blurb. Having watched political and economic developments over the last few years, that's still a part of my personal utopia, but I don't think it's an effective solution in practice. It seems to me that Wall Street finds new ways to make profits at the expense of its customers and, when things go really wrong, taxpayers who bail them out at a remarkably quick pace. Congress, by contrast, moves far more slowly. The last major reform was Dodd Frank, passed in 2010, thanks to a Democratic supermajority in the Senate which happens once in a blue moon , and the financial industry has been lobbying to water many elements of the law down ever since it was passed. A Republican congress will kill any attempts to pass new regulations, or amend existing ones for better enforcement. Even if we get new laws passed, it'll take a long fight, which financial lobbyists and their congressional allies will drag out as much as they can. Note that I'm not trying to make this a political issue. In 2008, Obama raised plenty of funds from Wall Street, though the numbers dipped in 2012 because his campaign was more populist. Reagan and Clinton both played a part in deregulation. I'm reasonably convinced that a dollar in lobbying money is worth 1 on either side of the aisle. Anyway, faced with this trend banks can make changes overnight, the federal government can take years or decades to pass new laws regulating Wall Street , the logical conclusion seems to be that trying to regulate Wall Street is like a game of whack a mole, with a very slow hammer and a very fast mole that periodically changes shape so the hammer is useless. I suspect there's a lot of information out there that I haven't considered, and I'd be glad to have reliable evidence that my view isn't necessarily correct. So, change my view.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Referendums are held on the terms of, and within the discourse of, establishment politics… but it’s time to reclaim the debate and the EU. The EU has some serious problems notably concerns with democracy and entrenched neoliberalism. This has had devastating effects, no more so than the fate of Greece, where the people voted against austerity multiple times, yet the Troika backed by a willing EU forced it upon them with ruinous consequences. The EU’s complicity in this assault on the Greek people is emblematic of its current state of contempt for alternatives to the neoliberal agenda. Despite these glaring issues with the EU, along with its capitalist roots and motivations, these problems do not constitute reason to abandon the project. With the rise of politicians and movements across the EU that are willing to challenge the status quo, now is the time to remain, and fight for an EU wide movement of progressives. If nothing else, a Remain vote is voting for a check on the Tories’ slashing of rights and regulations. Climate change, a doomed financial system, wealth inequality, etc. don’t respect national borders therefore isolationism is no solution. To tackle transnational problems, we need cooperative solutions a concrete example is the EU Financial Transactions Tax that the EU proposed, aiming at taxing the financial sector to mitigate some areas of worsening inequalities. It’s worth noting that the Tories opted out of this scheme. The EU may be a project of the elite, but that does not mean we shouldn't fight to reclaim it and repurpose it as a progressive, redistributive machine. While I respect the many on the Left who are campaigning for the UK to Leave, I am far from convinced that the current situation is propitious to a Brexit and pursuit of a Left agenda I think it's far more likely that a Brexit would only empower the marketisation of the UK. I am left in an uneasy situation tentatively supporting the UK to Remain in the EU, while trying to maintain distance from the business centric economistic appeals of the mainstream Remain troupe. Ultimately, the challenge remains clear whether we Remain or Leave, the neoliberal agenda is the ultimate target we must fervently fight against it either way.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>From a mathematical background, I think predicting the future is inherently unstable and that attempting to do so while hiding behind the veneer of quantification is dishonest. Long term economic trends pass tipping points unpredictably, and if big events can't be predicted by consensus then whats the point? Like history, those who ignore the lessons of economics are doomed to repeat past mistakes, but I think if we industrialised historians to the same degree as we do economists and marginalised economics to academia, we would end up with a similar success rate at predicting the future and the workings of governance and enterprise would be much more engaging to the general populace, and therefore society would be more democratic. I'm from Australia if that matters.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I'd like to first state that I think meat is delicious and eat it whenever it is available. My argument is as follows Animals are capable of suffering, and to cause suffering is immoral. While I think that it is absolutely possible to raise animals for feed so that they live happy fulfilling lives, animals in condensed feeding operations are confined in small crowded cages, left wallow in their waste, sometimes never even see the light of day, and are often mistreated and abused by their handlers. This obviously causes a large degree of suffering. On the other hand, it's possible to have sex with an animal without it suffering. For example, if I were on my hands and knees lying naked on the floor and a dog came up behind me and mounted me under it's own free will, it's not being coerced or harmed in anyway. While there are definitely abusive forms of bestiality, and ethical forms of animal farming, I believe that the form of beastiality I just described was more ethical than the form of farming I just described.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Recently I watched a video where a question was posed that I began to think about. Is rape ever ok? Most people would answer no. And at that point I agreed with them. But that same night as I was looking through the different posts on Reddit I saw something about the pedophillia in the Catholic church. And I began to think about this awful subject matter. Now to the best of my knowledge pedophiles in prison often get 'punished' by others that hate pedophiles or have children. This 'punishment' isn't always rape but, I think that sometimes it is. I have conflicting thoughts and beliefs because I think that rapists should be put in prison, I don't think that it should go unpunished. But I have absolutely no sympathy for those who are repeat offenders in the act of pedophillia who are 'punished' while they are in prison. I don't think that all rape should go overlooked in prison, it is a terrible thing that I am sad is a part of society. I want someone to convince me why it is a thing that needs to be stop tell me why and how you think we would be able to stop this act. If you think this is some kind of justice for the children who will be changed forever tell me why you think that maybe this could be overlooked.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Water Privatisation<|ARGUMENT|>When water is not treated as an economic good, it is wasted. On a domestic level, unmetered access to water means that consumers do not pay according to the quantity they use and so they will use it wastefully. At a national level, subsidised water for farmers and industry encourages wasteful methods and inappropriate crops (e.g. growing water-hungry cotton in California or Central Asia, both naturally areas of semi-desert), often with a damaging impact upon the environment. Pricing water according to its true cost would promote more efficient and environmentally-friendly practices, e.g. the use of drip-irrigation or dry farming in agriculture.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>As a white Canadian citizen, I have grown up with the idea that the First Nations people had their land unfairly taken away from them by the European settlers through unfair treaties, and as a result of this, the Government of Canada throws various freebies at the First Nations people, such as Specific job opportunities only open to First Nations. Thousands of dollars in scholarships only available to First Nations. They allow the First Nations people to govern themselves, yet supply utilities, free healthcare, sanitation systems, etc. Major subsidies to certain post secondary programs only available to First Nations. Free land housing available only to First Nations on Native reserves. Still, every year I hear in the news the First Nations people wanting more special treatment, more freebies. Now arguably, the Government of Canada has been attempting to assimilate First Nations people for the past 100 years, so perhaps the whole First Nations should be happy with what they've got idea has been imprinted into my brain through mass media. I am supposed to sympathize with the First Nations people, but I am finding it difficult to do so. Please Change My View.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>On reddit and other sites I continually hear people say with absolute confidence that atheism is not a belief in no God but a lack of belief, and so people who criticize atheism or state that it is a kind of faith just as much as theism are wrong. The justification for this is usually the argument that the prefix a means not so a theism must mean not theist. I believe this is mistaken. First, the dictionary definition Definition of atheism 1 the belief that there is no God. 2 disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings. Read More These are clearly binary statements showing hard stances of belief disbelief, not a lack of belief. Note that these are the only two definitions on dictionary.com. Webster's dictionary is much the same, using disbelief and doctrine to describe atheism. Compare this with agnostic Definition of agnostic person who believes that the existence of God is unknown and unknowable or that human knowledge is limited to experience. Read More This is a lack of belief. The synonym study clarifies that an agnostic refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine while an atheist has a doctrine that there is no God. Now some people claim that there is such thing as Gnostic and agnostic atheism. These seem to be very modern labels people use to escape the argument that atheists disbelieve in God by saying they are agnostic atheists . Now these terms don't seem to be recognized by any major dictionary, but from their usage it seems to mean that a Gnostic atheist faithfully states that there is no God with a sense of certainty, while an agnostic atheist says that there is no God but we don't have proof? I've yet to have someone really clarify this in a way that makes sense to me. Here's the thing if you state that there is definitely no God on your faith alone, that isn't Gnostic atheism, that is just atheism If you say we don't have proof but there is probably no God, that falls within agnosticism. If you say there is no proof but there is definitely no God, yet this somehow isn't a decision of faith, i don't think there is a particular word for that because you are talking out of your in a sense there. So maybe agnostic atheism is the word to use here but it is a corruption of both words in this case. Some anticipated counterpoints We should let people label themselves as whatever they want. No, because this confuses the argument and not only makes it difficult to understand what the other person is trying to say and to state things clearly yourself, it allows dishonest commentators to constantly say no, you haven't proven me wrong because I'm really this ad nauseum. The current definitions are too broad. We can easily narrow them down by saying I am an agnostic who believes our existing knowledge makes God almost impossible, but we don't have the evidence to prove the theory of God wrong instead of misusing words which already have a definition and causing confusion. Agnostics have no doctrine so they can't say that there is isnt a God, which means there needs to be a word between I just don't know and atheism. I think this is the strongest argument as doctrine means principle or belief and isn't necessarily limited to a yes no binary dynamic. Still, it seems much clearer and more logical to say I'm agnostic but there is probably no god than to say I'm an agnostic atheist so there is no god but there is also no proof but this isn't a matter of faith. Agnostic atheism seems hypocritical to me. Also see the Socratic definition below. Edit, one more from reading other agnostic atheist threads The dictionary definition of atheist is too narrow and hardly anyone who calls themselves atheist fits it. I don't see the fact that people misunderstand the definition as a good reason in itself to change it. We should instead educate people on what these words actually mean. The reason I don't think we should compromise on this point is the confusion discussed above. Plus the proposed new definitions seem contradictory. Unlike some other cases, accepting these new definitions doesn't actually make conversation easier this isn't just being pedantic, it is being understandable. Also, those people who do identify and use these words properly shouldn't be forced to re label themselves simply because internet goers got it wrong. It's also unclear whether most people get the word wrong or if it's just the reddit community and a few other forums. I'd love to see information based on academic texts or political news discussions. I truly welcome anyone to correct my definitions of Gnostic and agnostic atheism. As I said, i couldnt find official definitions and I've only heard the terms used online so I'm basing their definitions on that context and my own limited analysis. Edit so far the definitions I wrote here haven't been corrected, but some people have added that there is a chart comparing two axes theist atheist and gnostic agnostic with the intersection of each being a different word. This seems to come from the writings of Richard Dawkins originally and is also cited on some blogs. Otherwise, change my views here that atheism is a hard belief disbelief and agnosticism is the soft version, and that gnostic agnostic atheism is a misappropriation of these words to create definitions which already exist as other words and that this is harmful to clear, honest discussion of the topic. Edit as an addendum to the definition of agnosticism I posted above, please note If you look at the definition of agnostic it carries a few other meanings including someone who carries neither of two opposing opinions on a topic such as I'm agnostic on cats vs dogs. this already fills in all the gaps between atheism and theism, which have until now been defined as opposite views. Which is further evidence that the corruption of the word atheism is useless and confusing. The idea that Dawkins wrote it this way doesn't seem a valid reason to ignore atheism being binary and agnosticism filling in the gaps, which has been clear, concise and established. At the moment I'm getting mostly down votes for a post I put a lot of thought into and have commented on every response to. Are you down voting because you disagree with me or because you think I'm unwilling to change my view? Also no one has so far addressed anything beyond what is the correct definition of these words today. The point that the original definition of atheist was binary has not been challenged, nor has the idea that binary is clearer. Some people have said that the definitions used on r atheism are the ones real atheists use but have given very little evidence of this. I'm open to that idea but since the dictionary, which reflects real language use, all academics I've spoken to and nearly every atheist I've met in person all use the classic definition I haven't been given any reason to think it extends beyond reddit and the writings of Richard Dawkins. I argue back hard and ask you to give me evidence but provide that and I'll happily change my view. I do acknowledge that of the major English dictionaries, Oxford does include lack of belief as part of its definition of atheism for the US and Britain , but that is also inconsistent with its definition of agnosticism in its US English section. It seems Dawkins and other modern writers may have had a pronounced effect on the current definition in the British entries in the Oxford dictionary. The other major dictionaries do not seem to include lack of belief, only disbelief. Edit My purpose here was to see if a consensus could be established either way on the definition of the word and it's clearest use but my view has ended up being changed to Avoid such loaded words entirely, especially when discussing delicate topics like religion. My view is also changed in that several important groups and a significant number though not all of individuals define themselves by the inclusive definition of atheism which is a spectrum, not binary. This type of usage really does change the definition of the word, even if it makes it less clear. Conclusion 1 atheism should be officially updated to be inclusive based on widespread use and self identification with the term 2 in discussion it is best to clarify how you're using the word from the start or avoid using such charged language 3 I still believe the inclusive definition is unclear and technically incorrect, but those drawbacks are outweighed by colloquial understanding and self identification in most contexts. Bonus I'm still going to call myself agnostic but you can call me atheist if you feel like it.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Backstory I am a senior in high school, and I was recently awarded recognition by the College Board's National Hispanic Recognition Program. What this means is that I got a high PSAT score compared to other Hispanic Latinos. At my high school, three other students received some sort of recognition from the College Board for their test scores. Two of them were white, and another was Korean. They received normal National Merit Scholar recognition, as none of them were Hispanic or Latino and were thus ineligible for that award. At the same time, there are other students at my school who received higher test scores than I did, but lower than the three other students did I know this for a fact I have compared scores with some of them . In my opinion, they are more deserving of awards than I am. However, because I am Hispanic, I was given an award, and those other students who tested higher than I am were not. Here are my views on the situation i.e. what to change I believe that there are other students who deserve an award more than I do, but only did not receive an award because they are not Hispanic. This is bad. I may be deserving of this award, but I don't believe I am deserving of an award in general, if that makes sense. I understand that the Hispanic award is not as high of an honor as the normal one, but I believe that does not undercut my original point. I believe that this is further exacerbated when it is taken into account that the only group recognized separately from the main pool is the Hispanic group. There is no group that is exclusively for whites, blacks, Asians or Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, etc alongside the normal, overall pool. Although having all these groups would not necessarily make it a good thing, it would be less bad, in my eyes, than having only a Hispanic group alongside the all encompassing one I believe that having recognition for high test scoring Hispanics or other racial ethnic groups, for that matter is not inherently a bad thing. However, I think this should be restricted to just telling people their percentile among different groups or something along those lines.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>The most upvoted comments concerning Pirate Bay always hold it to some impossible level of importance. It comes across as people thinking that piracy is justified because big studios charge too much money for their goods. I understand that Piracy can force the market to adapt in order to lower prices or allow for easier access, and this leads to the birth of Steam or Netflix. What I don't understand are the people that hold it as some sort of right to have access to anything and everything at no charge simply because they have an internet connection. There is no situation where I would illegally download a move that was just released in theaters or before it was released . That is flat out stealing, and harms the industry as a whole. There is also no situation where I would pirate a recently released game for the same reason. Further, the argument of They don't deserve my money that people always throw around concerning the likes of Ubisoft or EA is an incredibly idiotic argument to justify piracy. If there is a product by a company you want to consume then purchase it. I don't agree with the human rights violations that happen in China or Bangladesh, but that doesn't mean I'm justified to steal the products produced there in lieu of boycotting them. I feel like I should add as an addendum that there is one situation where I have thought it was justified to pirate a movie, and would have if I had been able to. My father was bedridden while fighting Lung Cancer and wanted to see the second Hobbit. There was no way he could have sat through it at the theater, and we knew he wouldn't be around long enough for a DVD release. That is such an extreme case though, that I hard think that it can be used as a justification for the existence of the Pirate Bay.

<|TOPIC|>Boarding Schools Are Beneficial To Children<|ARGUMENT|>As well as allowing for flexibility in curriculum choice, boarding schools can also accommodate a variety of specific family or lifestyle considerations. Children with specific learning or emotional needs can also benefit from specialised help as noted above. Particularly important is the way a boarding school may provide relief for parents from the day to day strains of dealing with a child’s problems, making time spent together more pleasant. Sometimes time away from the home benefits the child whose problems may be caused or exacerbated by troubles at home, for example divorce, bereavement or illness of a parent. On a merely practical level, parents whose work requires them to travel extensively, live in remote areas or abroad may find boarding school a useful way to provide stability and continuity in their child’s education.<|CONCLUSION|>

The incredibly popular Harry Potter films, for example, would not have been half as convincing without the large cast of actors under the age of 18 playing the schoolchildren. Child actors are also necessary in the advertising industry, in order to make products appealing to a younger audience. Some sports, too, would be endangered if children were not allowed to compete.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Not trying to pot stir or anything it's just I thought of this for a while now and would at least like to talk about it. I accept society as it is and will adapt whenever it applies to me but I personally feel women have a leg up on relationships and sex. Simply because they have so much value when men basically have very little to give. So they often start with disadvantages. So the obviously solution is to found out what women want and what they need and the biggest reason why it is so hard to get these things is because you need to date more women to get them. Confidence, humor, sex game, conversation, emotional connection, etc. Is what can be acquired through dating women. The hard part is you have to find women when you absolutely nothing to offer them and hope they accept you. Which can be very fustrating. Not impossible but indeed very hard. When you're guy you have to know how to please women and know exactly what they want because they don't like to tell you what they want, just expect you to just know. It's like playing Dark Souls on a slightly harder setting with absolutely no tutorials or HUD. You're basically going in blind.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Disclaimer I'm all for Net Neutrality, but I cannot simply call others who disagree ignorant or greedy. I want to try to hear them out. Why Net Neutrality may not be good? A friend of mine who is not associated with the media industry argues that the problem is the lack of competitions. If cable companies are truly in an open competition with each other, then customers would have choices and would choose the company that looks after their interests. So, the solution should be to fix this aspect and restore market competition instead. This, to him, is the root cause. Applying government regulation is contrary to the open market and capitalism. At best it is short term. At worst, government itself could corrupt themselves and use it to violate greater human rights. What are other arguments?<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Curse of Knowledge I admit that this is a messy and generalized opinion based on subjective experiences I have attempted to reconcile, albeit poorly. This correlation could very well be more relevant to other issues, such as the psychological profile of people attracted to the field, the nature of mathematics, math education in the US, hierarchy stereotypes of related jobs, bad teachers, etc., or I could be wrong all together. I am easily swayed on this one. Throughout junior high and high school I was placed in the advanced math courses and did well, however I noticed the trend that my friends who did really well in math as in constantly bored by how easy and effortless it was were generally useless in explaining it, defaulting to the frustrated mantra of many of the math teachers You do it this way because that is how it is done These friends were consistently very close to the math teachers, and from the outside it seemed less a matter of shared interest, and more an issue of similar personalities. While I did well in math, I could not have survived or felt reasonably confident had I not done a lot of research and study outside of lectures and the information in many of the textbooks. Many teachers and textbook authors would jump huge logical gaps, foregoing reasonable explanation in favor of a vague order of sometimes unclear instructions, with the expectation that principles that had been lightly covered 4 years ago if at all were as fresh as the morning dew, and required no review. Math can be very much like a foreign language, where those who are fluent are surprised when beginners do not understand what they believe is a simple sentence, not recognizing their own failure to acquaint themselves with the students' limited scope of knowledge. Part of the problem is likely inconsistency in content and quality of teaching, but I'm hoping someone will have more information and correct my own logical gaps.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I am currently 20 years old attending college. College was never my goal in life, in fact until the final semester of high school I was set in enlisting in the Navy. My goal is to become a Navy SEAL. I decided to attend college to appease my mother and my grandfather who want me to have a degree encase something happens during training or during my career where I cannot continue being a SEAL or don't make it. I'm about to start my fourth semester of college, assuming I take nine hours over the summer I will be able to graduate in three years as opposed to the typical four. I'm good at college. I'm a political science major with a minor in strategic studies and am currently running a 3.74 GPA. The problem is I'm absolutely miserable in college. I hate being in classes and I feel like it's a detriment to my actual goal of becoming a Navy SEAL. Any day I have to forgo training towards the SEALs working out to work on classwork just depresses me further. Navy SEALs have an expiration date. It's a high stress job both on the mind and body that one cannot do forever. I feel that every year I'm here in college is a year taken away from me on a SEAL team. Almost everyone I know tells me to finish out college but is it worth my misery? It's not as if I won't finish college after the Navy with the GI Bill I won't have to owe anyone for my degree either.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Hey everyone. LTL, FTP, all that jazz. So, my position is fairly simple, the Iran deal sucked. Why? Because, first and foremost, it was a band aid at best, as it allows Iran to purchase the equipment necessary to refine nuclear materials in 15 years. Next, inspections. Sure, we can inspect the sites suspected of nuclear production and testing. After a 7 day waiting period for approval FROM IRAN, then if they say no up to a few weeks if I remember right before any action can be taken. Plus, the sanctions will never be able to be put in place again, as Russia has absolutely no interest to do so to help us. Then there's how it was passed. Really? Calling it a nonbinding agreement to sidestep Congress? When you have to hide behind closed doors to make a deal, you're doing something wrong. And finally, there is the threat Iran is. People say that Iran is just trying to become a first world country, and is peaceful. Ha, yeah. And those Death to America speeches where the crowds chant back what the president says? Please.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>This was a hard thing to come up with a title for and may be ambiguous so I will try to explain better here. Whenever the assault weapon debate comes up, people on the side of more restriction typically talk about how an assault weapon can shoot many more rounds per second and for much longer than a handgun, therefore they should be limited. I don't hold this view, but if it came to the point where something MUST be banned I would come at it from a different angle. Banning should be based off of the carnage it can cause to a target, not the amount of targets it can hit. For example, if grenades were legal and were on the chopping block to be banned, saying that it could injure dozens of people at once would not be the best reason, the best reason for banning it would be because a grenade will blow off limbs and cause enough damage to decimate a human body. I think of guns in the same respect, it's not how many people it can injure, it's the type of injuries that matter. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>When I mention an omnipotent creator I am referring to a universal creator that created the universe and subsequently humanity and all it's subsets. Specifically I am referring to the Abrahamic God because the Abrahamic religions are the major bringers of the free will argument. For the sake of the debate one must consider the beliefs of the three major Abrahamic religions Judeism, Christianity and Islam, which all worship the same omnipotent force who created the universe. Free will is to be considered the power of a sentient being to make decisions based on conflict, or more simply the ability to act of ones own discretion. The major argument of the Abrahamic religions is that the Deity creates the universe and life, and allows the life forms to make their own choices aka free will . This occurs in spite of the Deity's knowledge of the future and control over the environment. I am not here to debate the legitimacy of the religions, I simply wish to debate the idea of free will when given the existence of creator. My main argument behind my claim is that when a creator controls every aspect of a life forms life it becomes impossible for the life form to make it's own decisions. The life form thinks that it's decisions are it's own, but it's decisions are made because of the creators impact. The creator has created every brain cell and every neuron that impacts the decisions, so while the being makes decisions based off of it's brain it is in reality the creator who is making the decisions through the being. An omnipotent force would not only control the creation of life, it would also have knowledge of every decision they make. The creator knows everything that is going to happen and everything that has ever happened because he is omnipotent. I see it impossible that a human can make his own decisions when the creator knows what decision he is going to make and has programmed him like a computer to make that decision. Consider a computer that is programmed to make it's own decisions. Now consider that the creator knows every decision the computer is going to make, because he programmed it that way. Does this computer have free will? I would argue that it does not, because it is simply a puppet used by the creator to do a task. The computer believes it is making it's own decisions, but since sense the programmer has programmed the computer which decisions to make it is not truly the computer who is making those decisions. I don't mean to offend anyone with my opinion, I just wish to see the opposing arguments that you all can offer. I am not attacking anyones religion and I am in no way telling you what to believe, I am simply stating my opinion on one of the more popular theories on the meaning of the universe. Sorry for rambling, I kind of got carried away with this. If you can, Change My View.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Yep, I'm what you might call a militant vegetarian. I think for human civilization to survive we will have to abandon meat. Not necessarily all animal products, but certainly red meat. We know that the two main greenhouse gasses are methane and CO2. Contrary to CO2, methane has a much shorter half life, meaning that if we stop emitting methane we see a much faster impact on global temperatures. This is important, because although CO2 is a long term problem, our acute short term problem consists of staying beneath two degrees, to avoid positive feedbacks like droughts and the disappearance of north pole ice . From Wikipedia gt A 2006 UN FAO report reported that livestock generate more greenhouse gases as measured in CO2 equivalents than the entire transportation sector. Livestock accounts for 9 percent of anthropogenic CO2, 65 percent of anthropogenic nitrous oxide and 37 percent of anthropogenic methane. A senior UN official and co author of the report, Henning Steinfeld, said Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems. 17 gt Nicholas Stern, the author of the 2006 Stern Review on climate change has stated people will need to turn vegetarian if the world is to conquer climate change . 21 President of the National Academy of Sciences Ralph Cicerone an atmospheric scientist , has indicated the contribution of methane by livestock flatulence and eructation to global warming is a “serious topic.” Cicerone states “Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere now. The population of beef cattle and dairy cattle has grown so much that methane from cows now is big. This is not a trivial issue. 22<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>This seems like a pretty obvious solution that is supported by mainstream Dems and GOPers. It has also been a success in Australia, Canada, the UK, and New Zealand. A merit based immigration system will help reduce income inequality in the nation, help fill high skilled jobs which currently have many vacancies , and will not reduce low skilled workers due to visas like the HB2 . Not only will implementing this system help the US financially and through creating a more robust workforce, it will also help facilitate a political solution to the current immigration problem, which hasn't been comprehensively addressed since 1986. I would prefer some type of immigration system resembling but not the same as the 2013 Senate Bill. Specifically, once implemented, I would prefer that 80 of immigrants are provided lawful permanent resident LPR status each year based on a merit based system. The rest of the immigrants given the LPR's can be refugees and service industry blue collar workers. I also think there should be some special exemption for souses of US citizens and children of US citizen's that doesn't count against the quota I listed, no hard cut off for the spouses, rather that would be dependent on eligibility criteria and the naturalization process already outlined in law. The blue collar workers would have a different merit based point system that I will not get into here. I think that this approach will help reduce income inequality in America, albeit slightly. It will probably also help with assimilation because immigrants will be self sufficient and not needing to live 2 3 families a house to make rent and ends meet. They also will not be dependent upon a network of immigrants from similar home countries to find work, due to their high skill levels and experience. It will also ease assimilation through ensuring that each immigrant can speak English. It will help make the US workforce transition into the technology age and make the economy more robust. Furthermore, this type of system would incentivize politicians to increase the amount of citizens provided LPR's and also naturalized on a yearly basis. Finally, it will also incentivize politicians to increase HB2 visas and the like, to be able to fill current vacancies and vacancies created by switching to a merit based system. The political aspects of this are related to political capitol and how legislation is negotiated. The Merit System would look similar to the 2013 Senate bill indicators and point system. I would prefer to have a hard number of necessary points for acceptance for each applicant, with a flex of 5 10 points either way so that a judgement can be made on individual's who are close to said cutoff. The allocation of points in both tiers is based on a combination of factors, including education, employment, occupation, civic involvement, English language proficiency, family ties, age, and nationality. For example, 15 points are allotted for a doctoral degree, 3 points for each year of work experience in a highly skilled job, 10 points for being a primary caregiver, and 8 points for being under the age of 24. There is no “passing score” that needs to be reached to qualify. However, the system prioritizes immigrants who are young, educated, experienced, skilled, and fluent in English. EDIT TO ADD DETAIL EDIT To Change My View, I will need to see a coherent and factually supported argument. Not some snark<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I was born and raised in America. I went to public schools and was taught about the great history of our country. I've learned of our exploit, our shining moments, and our past. I was a strong patriot for virtually my entire life. I am not a patriot anymore. Over the past several years, I've realized that, to my disappointment, this country disgusts me. Its history, as I've learned, is racist, sexist, anti democratic, and corrupt. The system now is, save for the racism and sexism which have improved greatly, but are still somewhat present, very much the same. We run propaganda campaigns comparing Russia to Nazi Germany, we parade around the world with our military like we own the place, and our politics back home are corrupt, anti Constitutional, counterproductive, or so egotistical that they're completely useless due to the gridlock. We beat our chests that we're the best country in the world, when, statistically, we are not. The drooling masses go driving around in their big pickup trucks because they're living in denial of scientific fact, the dimwits in our legislature either don't know what they're voting on, don't care what they're voting on, or simply line their pockets and vote based on that. Did I mention we live in a closed, two party system that shows no hope of changing and represents virtually nobody's views? Our economy is flawed, dangerous, and corrupt. Its unregulated influence has allowed national corporations to dictate what local governments can do, there is no inspiration for companies to do anything but make money, and they've funded a political party so heavily that tax may as well be one of the words that gets bleeped out. It's like we're a nation in denial of our own history. People here believe that America can do no wrong and that we should go galloping around with our apparently Christian Airforce and bomb every turrurist on Earth. We've decimated democratic governments out of paranoia, set up dictatorships that we later went to war with, and put ourselves in debt pointing missiles at an enemy that wanted nothing to do with us. The next problem is that people are resistant to change. This and that are communist though they almost never know what that word even means, this and that are the exact same as Hitler , and we're so mindblowingly simple minded that we deny numbers just to keep our identity, our money, and the idiotic ways that we are used to. Reddit, I am not a patriot, but I envy those who are. I want to join them again and be happy for the country that I live in, but I'm not going to lie to myself. Though I would never do anything to harm, impede, or destroy it, I fucking hate it. Sorry for the disorganized rant. CMV.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>There has been much discussion about r atheism as a default lately across Reddit, and the recent CMV highlighted this. However, I have a different proposition change the default to r trueatheism instead of r atheism. I believe it would serve the original intent since a large amount of the userbase is non religious without de valuing the reddit experience. Truthfully I think it would make Reddit a better place for new users. Instead of being hit with a Sagan bomb they'd have a default that is higher quality, more tolerant, less jerky, and just an overall better experience. I think that anyone who has switched from r atheism to r trueatheism knows EXACTly what I'm talking about. Obvious disclosure, I'm an atheist but it really decreases the quality of Reddit and brain cells that something intended for intelligent discussion is such a joke. It would be like if r history had OMG GHENGIS KHAN jokes every other topic. In addition, this fuels the absurdly irritating anti r atheism circlejerk. I cannot say how many times I've made a legitimate point about religion when it was the topic of discussion only to have someone use brave enlightened quotemaker etc. Frankly it's even more annoying than the puns. TL DR Should we censor r atheism? Absolutely not. But should we continue to endorse it as a staple of the Reddit diet? I'd disagree with that. If you think we should leave it because it has so many subscribers I'd ask that you take it off for a week and see just how many people join it without it being a default. r trueatheism offers the same ideas and benefits at a much smaller cost.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Should we worship a god that sends people to hell?<|ARGUMENT|>Omniscience, from the Christian Bible: "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father" \(Matt. 10:29\); "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world" \(Acts 15:18\)<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I haven't really thought this out heavily, but I'll do my best to make a proper case for myself, and I actually would like to see it from another's perspective. So here goes Having bought a game on one platform, it's not immoral to pirate the same game on another platform. I'm not even really talking legally though feel free to inform me , but wether I am negatively influencencing the victim company s with this. This of course excludes remakes, GOTY editions and other versions that add substantially to the game, assuming you own the vanilla version. This does not include better graphics on PC or Keyboard mouse support .By buying the game on one platform I have compensated the developer fully for all the work gone into making it, buying another version that adds nothing to the previously bought version is just paying twice the price for one product, solely because the rivalery of companies Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo prevents cross buy. Expanding on my personal buying behaviour, 90 percent of the time I wouldn't have re bought the game anyway, and am doing it purely for convenience bought on Xbox, torrenting on laptop so I can play it when I'm gone too so the developer console company won't make a loss on my illigal copy, and the other 10 of the time I might be interested in rebuying a game bought on console for PC for, say, the mods which are fully made by people outside the company, and do so for no profit , and I still might just have enjoyed the game enough to justify a rebuy if the price is right i.e. I enjoyed the first Fable game greatly on Xbox, and bought Fable TLC in a Steam sale for 3 so I could play it again with mouse keyboard and in widescreen. This port technically has some added content but is also the only version available on PC, I wasn't interested in the extra content and could have done without would I have had the option. Therefore, I wouldn't have felt guilty about torrenting it but at that price I have no issue considering the fun and time I put into it already. You could argue that in theory, I could buy a console that a company has been selling at a loss in hopes of earning this back in sold games, and pirate every single game on it as I already own them on another gaming machine, therfore have the console company make a loss on me. I think that's a risk you take when you're selling your machine at a loss, and if that business model doesn't work for you, change it. Of course the odds of someone doing specifically this are very, very low, and is but a minor dent in the ten hundred thousands or even millions of consumers raking in the profits for these companies. I would be no more harm to them than a person buying the sole console only to let it eat dust in the basement, not to mention the fact that I have a perfectly fine gaming laptop and wouldn't be buying their consoles anyway if it wasn't for their exclusives, which as the name suggests, are exclusive to that console. Along with that, pirating a game on pc fully cuts out the machine developer middle man and makes the loss go directly to the game developer. I think that's pretty much it, I thought this up on the spot and read it over a few times but there might be some holes in it, feel free to use those of course. Also, I do apologise if this has been asked before, I did a quick search before posting and found nothing. Maybe my arguments make for a different approach to the case.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>While Google generally used to have a very positive reputation on reddit, it seems as of late, users have been more untrustworthy of them. People frequently bring up their Don't be Evil motto mockingly. Yet I have yet to see any reason to mistrust them, or avoid their services due to questions about their ethics with data. To me, Google has demonstrated they can be trusted with user data because They allow users to clearly see all the data they have on them They show they take the security of their platform very seriously. They offer large bounties to those that discover security vulnerabilities with their products. Google resists government overreach in accessing user data. They are involved in multiple court cases to fight giving the US government access to certain users' data. While I know they likely wouldn't be safe to use if you were a person of high interest to the government e.g. Edward Snowden , I do not fault Google for this or think they are unethical because they have no choice. Change my view <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>My thinking is that there are just too many of us to actively monitor. Yes, Shia Lebouf told us about how 1 in 5 phonecalls we make were recorded, but that's so much audio to sift through. There are 6 billion phone calls made every day in the US, so about 1.2 billion phone calls are being recorded. Every day, something like 80 years of video is uploaded on YouTube, Reddit gets 10 million new comments, and there are 400 million new tweets. Don't get me started on the 300 billion emails sent every day They just don't have the manpower to dig into 99.999 of citizens' lives, and for any of this to be worth the effort, money, and bad press, they're only going to look at either people they already have flagged, or have certain words flagged, and even then they aren't getting to 99 of those. Just because a library of congress has Stephanie Meyer's autobiography doesn't mean that book will ever, ever be opened. Hell. With Instigram, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and whatever other social networks I'm not cool enough to know about there's not much left to hide anyway.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I feel sex has risks and a child is one of them. A couple could have agreed to raise a child together but when she gets pregnant he could decide he doesn't want to anymore. Then the woman was cheated and now has to raise a child by herself. A couple could have also agreed to abort any pregnancy that may come from having sex. If the woman does get pregnant and decides she wants it, the man is cheated. But he has taken on the risks of sex in the first place. I myself could never have an abortion. I am pro choice but I would feel incredibly guilty, though my family and friends are pro choice and I know I would not be judged. Another thing, the father doesn't always have to pay child support. My father doesn't, but he also has no parental rights. I know this is seen as unfair,but if a woman doesn't want to have an abortion because it could mess her up pretty bad mentally I don't think she has to have one. Edit I feel the exceptions to having the father pay child support is if he is mentally unfit, can't afford it or if he wants to raise the child with the mother but she refuses to.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Background Comedy Central CC announced Trevor Noah, a correspondent on The Daily Show TDS , would replace John Stewart on TDS when John steps down. Initial responses were positive, then a bunch of controversial tweets were noticed, and claims of antisemitism and misogyny have started a now familiar pattern of Internet Outrage. My opinion, that I would like to see if you can CMV This isn't a surprise, it's nothing more or less than CC should expect, given the direction TDS has taken, and its audience. So TDS can't blame anyone but themselves. Note that I am NOT saying the outrage is or is not justified. That's beside the point. I'm just saying it isn't surprising. Ok, here is why I think this isn't a surprise, and why TDS is responsible. A TDS has not been about comedy for a long time now . It's about politics . John uses it as a platform to bash Fox News and to a lesser extent the Republicans and also CNN and Arby's When John has to decide between making something funnier or making his criticism of Fox News more on point he always chooses the latter. I personally dislike Fox News, and happy to see it criticized. But that's not the issue. The issue is that TDS is a political satire show, not a comedy for sake of comedy show. Just to make that clear, look at Weekend Update on Saturday Night Live. Obviously everyone involved there is left leaning, pro gay rights, etc., yet it isn't about politics. Politics are one thing they make fun of. It's the comedy they place as their highest priority. I'm not saying they are or are not funnier than TDS just that the shows' priorities are flipped. Weekend Update jokes about 1,000 other things than politics, and they poke fun every which way even when they are talking about politics. TDS isn't anywhere close to that. On TDS, the message is the point, and the message is a political one. Comedy is the means of making it interesting for the audience. There's nothing wrong with that, of course political satire is very important. But my point so far is that TDS isn't about Comedy, it's about Politics. B Furthermore, TDS has slid to left wing outrage based identity politics . TDS has been very focused on proper PC messaging for a while, from William's and Schaal's feminist pieces on women, to a strong focus on hiring minority people, to Stewart explaining white privilege to that Fox News guy, etc. etc. Not that any of those things are wrong. It's great Stewart worked to get more minorities into CC now both his show and the one after are or will be hosted by funny black guys , and some of them are amazing Aasif Mandvi is my favorite . And it's great that there are pieces on women's issues, but they bring out the same old tired talking points like the 70 cent misrepresentation of the wage gap all the time, with the same biting sarcasm that you hear from feminists on Tumblr and Twitter. And TDS has been using more and more terminology from that political space, like White Privilege , as well as bringing on guests promoting it. Again, I'm not arguing any of those are wrong, nor that TDS is wrong to go that way. It's fine if they want to. But that brings me to my final point C So far I've claimed that TDS is a show about politics, and increasingly outrage driven internet style politics. It's audience is, unsurprisingly, similar those that don't like those politics have simply left . So TDS is watched by people that care more about politics than comedy, and that have very strict rules about what is ok to say and what isn't, for fear of Outrage breaking out and being Shamed. So why is it surprising that those people are Outraged about Trevor Noah's not perfectly politically aligned tweets? It isn't surprising, it's the obvious result. For such an audience, which TDS has either adopted or created, the host has to be first and foremost ok politically. Strong preference for anyone that isn't a white dude that goes without saying but more importantly, that doesn't make jokes about stuff that isn't ok to joke about. Be funny if you can, it's a plus, but first of all don't pick the wrong topics that's how things work for that audience. Am I wrong? Is there anything surprising about this? edit It's Weekend Update on Saturday Night Live, not Weekly Update . Thanks mizz kittay<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Smoking during pregnancy can lead to low birth weight infants, putting them at risk for a wide variety of health problems during infancy as well as later in life. Smoking can cause problems with the placenta, causing placental abruption, which endangers the life of both mother and baby. Babies born to women who smoke are also more likely to be born with birth defects. Smoking during pregnancy and around an infant is one of the leading causes of SIDS Sudden Infant Death Syndrom which is leading cause of infant mortality in the U.S. Source Parent's who choose to smoke endanger the lives of their children, yet their are no consequences for their actions.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I think that categorizing any group of people based on their ethnic background can lead to many forms of generalization that could lead to stigmatization the more stigma, the more division, the less likely it is that people will stop paying attention to ethnicity People will often say that colonization was a result of white supremacy but isn't it the opposite? Colonialists were motivated by greed and power, and used the stigmatisation of foreign populations to justify their inhumane actions. Think of it the same way Hitler raised the masses against the jewish and the gipsies before the holocaust dehumanize and vilify a cotagory of humans for your own interest and never have anyone oppose your decision to treat them like cattle. This is very anecdotal, but maybe I should mention that I'm an arabic living in North America, so I've experienced racism in many different forms<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I grew up in a high school that was, I thought, absurdly pro athleticism. Scholarships were constantly being thrown at these scholar athletes, their education was being paid for them because they could run well with a ball, they often had around 2.5 GPAs. This all happened while the intellectuals and pseudo intellectuals as myself were left to their own means. Today, being a professional athlete gives about probably one of the highest paying jobs in America, while researchers and doctors make fractions of that. I simply feel that we have assembled this society that values sports and entertainment over everything else and this view is continually being pushed as it is highly marketable. I, to this day, carry somewhat hateful, perhaps envious, opinions of these scholar athletes. I make fun of people who desired to be a pro sport player rather than pursue what I thought to be meaningful careers. Please, change my view,<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>It's obvious that Trump has violated the terms of service and is continuing to do so but blocking him would do no good and would probably harm us. Even if mouthing off on Twitter doesn't actually calm him down, it lets the world see his mindset and gives us a greater chance of somebody removing him from office. In other words that gives him a noose to hang himself with. There's still too much of the public that agrees with him and doesn't know him for the disaster that he is but it gets harder for them to deny it when things like this are made public. Without Twitter we would have no way of seeing this information and if he were impeached all his supporters would still be able to argue that he was wronged and that there was some Grand conspiracy working against him. With his tweets available to the world only the most ignorant are able to claim that he isn't delusional and dangerous. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>The idea of having a two party system in the United States is absolutely insane. Many Americans feel the same way as well. So including the 3 other main parties that people don't really know about in debates for the general election would really spark an interest for other candidates. Especially those that are far left and far right. Of course this will not ever ensure that the Green party for example will win, nor for the Constitution party or Libertarian party. It will provide a way for voters to see that yes, there are other parties that they can vote for besides just democrat and republican. Yes, I do understand that some voters do know that's a thing. Like how in 2012, over than one million people voted Libertarian. I believe that the news outlets such as NBC, CBS, Fox, and ABC should be required to invite these candidates to the debates for the general election. If more people saw that there were more candidates that they can choose from then maybe the two party system will eventually be broken up. Maybe not 2016, 2020, or even 2024, but maybe 2036, or 2040.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>In the United States, we are facing a terrible opiod and benzo crisis. We lock up the victims while the cartels are still going strong and reeking havoc in Central and South America. The reason MOST people are dying from these drugs is due to the cutting of drugs, improper dosage, or completely fake drugs. Obviously there are people dying from long term use or committing suicide, but with the user knowing exactly what and how much of a given substance they are putting in there body, the OD rate across the board would decrease significantly. Law Enforcement can also use drug usage as a scape goat to invade the privacy of impoverished or minority families. A very large majority of the cases of police brutality is connected to suspicion of drug usage or possession. The increase in violence in Central and South America is connected to the production of heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and others. We have families fleeing their home countries due to the violence of cartels and terrorist groups. Now seeking asylum in the United States. The violence in the countries would greatly be diminished if there biggest market for profit was gone. The medicinal properties of marijuana, psychedelics, and mdma are listed as Schedule I by the FDA. With legalization of these substances, we would have far better treatment for people suffering from PTSD, Despression, Anxiety, and other mental health problems. Another problem with prohibition is the gateway drug theory. A very large percentage of drug addicts start with weed. Lets say Jim wants to buy some weed and finds a guy at his local high school. Jim is now connected to the illegal drug trade and can also get coke, heroin, xanax, meth, etc. Jim gets caught smoking weed and and is getting drug tested, so he moves to a harder drug that can't be tested by a general drug test. Now Jim is addicted to K2 or something along those lines. He doesn't stop there and starts doing other drugs that his K2 dealer has. At 25, Jim is addicted to heroin and dies of an overdose of Fent. x200B My last point is people will always get what they want. If someone wants to get heroin, they will get heroin. Why cause all these problems so we can try to stop people from doing what they want to do? How many people would start doing heroin just because it was legal? If we had proper education and reformed our drug policy, our society would have more trust in the government. My question is how would you go about solving these problems? I'm very eager for this discussion and want to know other peoples solutions to solving these problems. x200B x200B<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>With recent allegations regarding some of the most talented people in Entertainment industry and many more coming to light soon enough its too easy to hate the person for his acts. People like CK, Kevin have done some horrific acts and they need to punished for the same, but it doesn't mean that the good things they did were just a facade and a joke to distract people. I mean whether or not one agrees, Kevin playing Underwood in House of Cards is one of the best acting I have seen in my life. And some of the Louie bits have a profound message hidden in them delivered to us in subtle ways. IMO, to reach such a high platform people need to be a bit fucked up in a sense take Jobs and Musk for example.And we should not mix up their life's hard work with who they are in their personal life.

<|TOPIC|>Is The Ubiquity of Heterosexuality Chiefly a Product Of Heteronormativity?<|ARGUMENT|>In fact, this social constructionist idea of society "indoctrinating" people to have a certain sexuality is ridiculous and goes against LGBT rights. If being gay is simply social conditioning, then that means there can be ways to reprogram gay people to be straight. This is incorrect and takes away one of the strongest defences that LGBT people have--which is that their sexuality is innate and biological and NOT a choice.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>People's main complaints about America's 2 party system is that there are not enough choices and not enough ideas. But IMO our 2 party system with primary elections covers the spectrum of ideas. For example, on the right we had a libertarian candidate, traditional republican candidates, traditional conservative candidates, and I guess fairly moderate but right wing leaning candidates. And on the left we have a Democratoc socialist, a moderate Democrat, and a pretty liberal candidate who dropped out. Now with all of these candidates across the spectrum, we narrow it down to the top two candidates. So the whole spectrum of political ideas are represented, and we don't have to worry too much about the spoiler effect of vote splitting in the general election. Also in the end, the two party system is majority rules. In a multi party system, for example with 4 parties, party 1 may receive 20 , party 2 receives 25 , party 3 receives 27 and party 4 receives 28 . The winning party wins with 28 of the population satisfied with 72 dissatisfied. Basically in the end a larger of the population will be unhappy in a multi party system.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Yes, I was cheated on recently. So, all you people saying, “found the jilted male,” can go fuck right off. And fuck the person next to you too. And then the person next to them also. My ex claimed I was not accepting of her “polyamorous” lifestyle. I laughed at that, and she said that was hateful and abusive. I take abuse seriously, so I want to know if I really do have a toxic view on polyamory. In my opinion, if you come to me and ask if you want to sleep with other people, and I say no, and you do it, then how in the world am I in the wrong on this? I’ve heard this said elsewhere by “true” polyamorous people, that monogamy is a social norm. Yeah, obviously. Is that supposed to be a bad thing? Are you really going to shame me into submitting to your wayward pleasures? It’s your life. Go fuck who you want. But the whole reason for a relationship in my opinion is loyalty. Presenting and entrusting yourself to someone else increases the risk of disease, and that makes it your partners’ problem. Call me a bigot. Whatever. Update Your responses were very logical, and I changed my view. Cheating is violating an agreement, polyamory makes no such agreement, therefore it’s not cheating. Monos can cheat polys can cheat. It’s all about the rules you set.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Medical marijuana dispensaries<|ARGUMENT|>People should be at liberty to treat their bodies how they want to. Indeed, people are allowed to eat and drink to their detriment and even death, so why shouldn't they be able to harm themselves with marijuana use? This is, of course, assuming that their use does not harm anyone else. This means, as with substances such as alcohol or cigarrettes, that regulations be put in place to ensure that one individual's consumption of marijuana does not violate the liberties of another citizen. If this is achievable with alcohol and cigarettes, it seems achievable with marijuana.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I know we have more technology than ever before, but the last major human advancement was going from cavemen to citymen. Science has definitely given us more knowledge, but humanity seems to generally be lacking in the wisdom department. Hell, I'd settle for a little more common sense. Here's some of the reason's I don't think we're as advanced as we typically believe 5 We can't figure out how the ancients built the megaliths Not only can we not recreate what the ancients did, we are generally lost as to how it was done. There are so many ancient sites that still confound us, the Sphinx and the Pyramids of Giza, Puma Punku, Gobekli Tepe, Stone Henge, Easter Island's Moai, the list goes on and on. I find it hard to call ourselves advanced when we can't even move many of the giant blocks that these advanced ancient civilizations used to build with. 4 We let natural resources run the world Civilization as we know it has always been dominated by the control of natural resources. People that control these resources have all the power, and they seem to get a raging boner for manipulating everyone for their own profit. During the bronze age it was the trade of bronze. Today it's fossil fuels. The worst part is we have the technology to move past this phase, but not the money, how ironic. On top of that, we consume these resources faster and faster each year as more of the world becomes industrialized. We really don't know how long these fossil fuels will last. Fossil fuel depletion gt It’s often claimed that we have enough coal to last hundreds of years. But if we step up production to fill the gap left through depleting our oil and gas reserves, the coal deposits we know about will only give us enough energy to take us as far as 2088. And let’s not even think of the carbon dioxide emissions from burning all that coal. 3 Advanced technology historically has been weaponized There are too many instances to list, but nuclear technology instantly comes to mind. Instead of clean energy, we made bombs. Newer tech that can revolutionize the world is epitomized by drones. We are coming into the age of drones, and the craziest idea so far is having them deliver a fucking package? The rate of drone use is rapidly increasing. Currently governments are mainly using drones to kill and spy, instead of more useful things like exploration and labor. Nikola Tesla was the greatest genius of the industrial age, and even claimed to have found out how to give free energy to the world. Nobody was interested because they couldn't profit from it. The only time any governments seemed to be interested in Tesla's work was when he claimed he could make a death ray 2 We don't have faster than light capabilities Yes, I'm calling out the prime directive. If we can barely make it past our planet, how can we call ourselves an advanced civilization? Recently, Voyager 1 may have left the solar system, scientists still aren't 100 sure. It was launched 1977 and is one of the fastest crafts we have, but that's not very efficient in the scope of intergalactic space. Until we can travel close to the speed of light or faster, exploration isn't really feasible. There are theories on how this can be done, but no serious research is being pursued. warp drives gt Is there any work being done to search for these breakthroughs? Yes, but not much. 1 We are still at the whim of the universe Not much explanation needed here, our advanced civilization could still go the way of the dinosaurs. Until we can protect the planet, we're only as advanced as the universe let's us be. There are theories on how this can be done, but if we actually found an asteroid in time and it came down to it we'd likely be screwed. There has also been a recent study that suggest we are in a snow globe solar system of asteroids. Can we be advanced if we can't protect our planet from catastrophic space events? The answer for me is not really. Not until humanity can start looking toward the future in terms of eons instead of decades. What do you think, are we really more advanced then early civilizations, or do we just have better stuff?<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>There are several reasons why this is a good idea. In the long run it will be very good for society and even the government. It may seem bad initially but hear me out People would still likely work part time. While I'm sure you could scrape by on basic income. For most people the choice to work would be a no brainer. Then they could afford to move to a better place of living. Most people would want to work simply because it gives one a sense of dignity and something to do with one’s time. Part time jobs would be more available. It would be easier to find a job because nobody would need to work two or three jobs just to survive. This would lower unemployment as jobs could be given to more people. It would prevent exploitation of workers. Currently, workers can be exploited because leaving their job would leave them homeless and it would be hard to find a new job. If losing a job weren’t necessarily a financial disaster, more people would be willing to walk out on jobs where they weren’t being treated with dignity. Student loans would be less of an issue. It would help students pay off their student loans. Additionally, fewer people would flunk out of school because of having to juggle studies and work. It would help victims of domestic abuse Far fewer people would be forced to stay with abusive partners, parents or roommates because they couldn’t afford to move out. The money would flow back to the government easily. People would be able to afford new stuff hey can’t afford now. New clothes, books, toys, locally produced food, car repairs and with each purchase money would flow back to the government, because Value Added Tax, along with income tax. Petty crime will be drastically reduced. Less financial desperation would lead to less petty crime, and hence less strain on police and security. It will help the family dynamic. Parents will be able to spend more time at home with their kids instead of working multiple jobs. Not to mention there are many teens who also have to work to support their family. This will also allow teens more time to study and get higher test scores.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Universities should make all academic work they produce, including scholarly articles, course handbooks and recorded lectures, available to the general public.<|ARGUMENT|>The United States University system is famously expensive and as a result it is probably the system in a developed country that has least public funding yet $346.8billion was spent, mostly by the states, on higher education in 2008-9.[1] In Europe almost 85% of universities funding came from government sources.[2] Considering the huge amounts of money spent on universities by taxpayers they should be able to demand access to the academic work those institutions produce. Even in countries where there are tuition fees that make up some of the funding for the university it is right that the public should have access to these materials as the tuition fees are being paid for the personal teaching time provided by the lecturers not for the academics’ publications. Moreover those who have paid for a university course would benefit by the materials still being available to access after they have finished university [1] Caplan, Bruan, “Correction: Total Government Spending on Higher Education”, Library of Economics and Liberty, 16 November 2012,  [2] Vught, F., et al., “Funding Higher Education: A View Across Europe”, Ben Jongbloed Center for Higher Education Policy Studies University of Twente, 2010. <|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Sorry for my phrasing. My english is a little wonky at times. Lil about me I grew up in India and I was and still am a very fidgety person and loved doodling while taking notes and I understand and know that it is an amazing tool for memory retention. I’ve also been that person who fell asleep in class cuz they were bored af. Another thing, I had the privilege of having very good and respectable teachers for most of my elementary school, and had great relationships with all of those teachers not so much in middle or high school college is meh , although the bad teachers were few and far between. Additionally in India, and I guess most Asian countries, respecting your elders, especially educators is insisted upon and taught from a young age. My household was filled with free thinkers who valued respect and didn’t define it as fear, so I really do respect most of the teachers I’ve met in my life, not only for who they are as people, but for their profession. — A. About sleepers I find people who fall asleep in class regularly and are crashing cuz they’re bored very disrespectful. I think this because of these reasons The person might be or most probably is distracting other students or even the teacher. Especially if they snore. And even more so when they take the front seats. If there is a group project, that student is usually bringing less to their group since they weren’t paying attention in class and so might need extra time to catchup or understand what is happening and contribute to the class. How you do on tests and in the class itself is a reflection of the course itself, the student and the teacher. Most teacher will be held responsible and will have to answer to parents guardians and their higher ups. Amazing teachers shouldn’t be responsible for a student slacking off or crashing in class and thus doing badly. Most teachers put in a lot of time and effort into their class, however fun or dry the class is. I just think it is really really disrespectful to not respect their effort. And you are actually wasting their time by dozing off in their class. Some concessions I am not talking about people who are sick, who’ve crashed like less than 5 times aka very rarely , have talked to their teachers about a problem, or have issues at home that causes them to need that extra hour or two of sleep. I have also crashed in school. Multiple times. I have also dreamt of doing it to spite a teacher cuz I knew that I’d be pissed off if someone slept off in my class on purpose. B. Doodling I love doodling and writing random nonsense along the margins of my notebook whatever paper I have near me while I’m taking notes. I am also one of those people who NEED to physically write stuff down while doodling AND hear it for it to get into my brain. I very rarely need to look back at it to remember it. So i find teachers who don’t allow students to doodle kinda on the dumber side of life or super snotty. At the same time, I do think that if a teacher has specifically told that they want all eyes on them when they convey something important maybe for a moment or two , people need to stop doodling. I really think that when teachers say something like that, it means they want eye contact and it’s just wrong not to give it to them since usually they’re just emphasizing something important that they might have said a second ago or will repeat again in a few minutes. Maybe it has been ingrained in me from my childhood, but not giving your teachers that little time is just wrong. — Here are my arguments I am actually quite keen on seeing the other side cuz I’ve been thinking about this a lot due to experiencing many different etiquetes during graduate school compared to my undergrad and high school experiences which are also very different compared to my schooling in India.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>First off, I was raised in a lower middle class household, my family was borderline poor. So I don't have a stake in this. That said, it strikes me as distinctly counter to the American Dream to deride others as trust fund babies. Part of the American Dream, surely, is to become successful enough to provide for your children. The natural end game of that goal, if you are very successful, is to set up a fund to make sure your kids are healthy and happy even after you're gone. So why do we blame these kids for their parent's success? I would hope one day I could be so fortunate to set up a trust fund for my own children. It seems like something to aspire to. I believe the American dream is making something for yourself in this world, and by extension taking care of your family. So calling someone's kids trust fund babies in an attempt to deride this situation is counter to the American Dream. To change my view, you'd have to convince me that most kids with trust funds are worthy of this derision and or parents who set up these funds aren't in fact living the American Dream. Change my view<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Currently it is against federal regulation to sell fetal tissue, But the regulation does not entirely stop sales but just prohibits compensation to the women. From gt Note that the word “donating” is used. The woman is “donating” the tissue. Planned Parenthood implies that no money will be involved in the “donating” of fetal organs and parts. Yet Planned Parenthood makes money due to the method listed above. This is possible because the NIH Revitalization Act exempts “reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue” allowing a loophole so that everyone can make money except the woman involved. Fetal tissue is important in advancing scientific research into how the body works, but there is a shortage, Medical abortions damage the quality of fetal tissue, so allowing sale of fetal tissue would compensate for the higher cost of surgical abortions. Making the sale of fetal tissue legal would allow compensation to go to the women, increase the supply of fetal tissue and it's quality.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Texas has been in the news lately with their Voter ID law getting some heavy opposition. The bill originally intended to prevent anyone who did not have a valid photo ID to participate in the elections in Texas. A district court judge recently blocked the law on the grounds that it is racially discriminatory. However, the appeals court stated that Texas could keep the law in place for the upcoming elections. I find it hard to believe that this could be interpreted as racially discriminatory as you need to have a valid ID to pretty much do anything in this country. So why should Texas or any state for that matter allow anyone who doesn't have a valid Photo ID to vote in their elections? EDIT I am very glad this post got the attention I thought it would. It has come to my attention that it is unrealistic to expect every United States citizen who is eligible to vote have a photo ID present when voting and I now agree. My underlying concern is ensuring that only United States citizens vote in United States elections and there are other ways to do that rather than photo ID's, however tricky those ways may be. This is a very sensitive topic for a lot of people and I get that it may not have serious implications now, but it could in the future there is no way of knowing. That being said, thank you all for your comments and articulate responses, my view has been changed. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Hi All, I am new to this subreddit and I have been hooked for the past couple of hours Apologies if I my title doesn't fit the style of questions posted on here, I promise I will get better with time On to my actual point. Why is betting allowed in some countries? As far as I understand it, this is how betting works. There is a bookie or an agency that takes bets on some event A. Let's assume there are a total of X people in this hypothetical world, and they all bet on this event A. The bookie is the one setting the odds for this event so he has some contextual knowledge of how many people have bet on the positive and negative outcomes of event A. It is in the best interest of the bookie to make sure that the odds are stacked in such a manner that he ends up making a profit. The money that a few people win based on the outcome of event A is basically the sum total of the money lost by the people losing their bets. That is how the betting odds are designed, aren't they? All this happens while making sure that the bookie booking agency takes a cut of every bet placed. How is this an acceptable thing? I have never bet a single cent in my whole life. Not in sports betting, not in friendly betting games. Whenever I think about the betting industry and think about making a bet, it only feels like I am taking someone else's hard earned money. I understand that the people who lose the money are fully aware of the consequences, but it still doesn't help me rid of the guilt that I am taking someone else's livelihood savings. I think there would be no gratification in the money earned through this, no sense of satisfaction of earning the money. I am not trying to argue this from a standpoint of the ethics of the players teams involved in the event on which the bets are placed. That is another can of worms that I do not wish to open at the moment. I merely want to understand this from an economics and ethical perspective of the people who make the bets. Why is it okay for me to take your money or for you to take mine? I am all for free choice, but doesn't the government society have a role to play in making sure that I don't make rash ill informed choices even though it is legal to do so? I am not sure if I am getting my view across correctly. I realize how hard it is to get my viewpoint across only when it comes down to putting pen to paper. I will gladly answer any and all questions that you might have regarding the clarity of my thought process here. Help me help you change my point of view <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>To clarify I am not talking about people making child porn or child molesters. I'm only talking about people caught possessing it. My reasons I found this TIL post and a lot of comments in it made a lot of sense. Pedophilia is today's McCarthyism or Salem Witch Trials Nobody wants to stand up against it, or you're automatically labeled a pedo or a commie or a witch. Prison doesn't help anyone. I get that imprisoning guys left and right for whatever reason can be scrounged up is a long American tradition just not a proud one but what exactly is the point? Who is this helping? The offender? No. Society? Not even a little. I also don't think they should be put on that God awful sex offender registry. That thing should ONLY be for people who are a threat to the neighborhood. Can you name a better way to keep someone from being a productive member of society than to march them around their neighborhood and force them to tell everyone they live near Hey. You know that thing everyone hates more than anything? I'm that. Well I look forward to awkwardly avoiding eye contact with you for the rest of my life. Would you hire a sex offender? The purpose of Megan's Law is to protect children period. How does this do that? Pedophiles are not destined to become child molesters. There's this thing we all agree on Rape is about power, not sex. How and why does this change because the victim is a child? There's a Harvard study that says pedophiles are most likely going to harm children in some way or other that always pops up when this assertion is made that I can't find at the moment, sorry. But assuredly someone is bound to cite it sooner or later here but the key thing from that study that everyone willfully ignores the sample of pedophiles interviewed for the study were in prison at the time , so it's not a wild leap to say that they were all there for harming children. I mean imagine your brother came to you today and said I'm a pedophile . Would you ever trust him around your kids alone, ever again? This guy you've known your whole life and I'd bet you a million dollars you'd treat him the same way you would treat a dirty vagrant around your kids. Why would a pedophile ever share this life ruining secret with anyone, ever? It's impossible to know how many pedophiles are out there because of that. Putting them in therapy to help channel their sexuality in a way that won't harm kids. This makes your children safer. Who wouldn't take a teeny, tiny tax increase that directly makes kids safer? Therapy is expensive and the price tag is a major barrier for people taking the step to get help. A nameless, random face on the internet will almost never be attached to an identity, so the victim in the picture will likely never be found, and the best justice you can salvage from the situation is that someone gets help for their dangerous habit. Throwing that guy in jail for having her picture doesn't make one ounce of a difference to that girl. At least this way, you're helping someone . CP of someone the perpetrator knows is pretty solid probable cause to find out if they broke any other laws, like rape or assault or the production of child pornography.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>While there's no doubt that the movie will make an insane amount of money, pretty much anyone over the age of 12 will be disappointed. The first 3 movies were beloved because they were original and had breathtaking, innovative special effects, but in terms of plot and character development were pretty lame. So what options does J.J. Abrams have? He can make a good movie, on that actually stands on its own in terms of scriptwriting an acting. And everyone who loves the original will hate it because it doesn't have the spirit of the original. Or, he can try to replicate that spirit. But everyone who saw the first 3 when they were young are more mature and sophisticated now and it will seem like drivel. See episodes 1 3 for reference . What does that leave? The film will never be judged by its own merit. We've all seen great special effects in other recent scifi movies, so that's not going to make up for anything. Of course, if someone asked Abrams or Disney whether you'd be ok making a billion dollars if it means that fanboys will be bitching, I'm sure they'd agree to the deal, so I don't feel bad for them. But I do feel bad for the millions who are so excited about the movie coming out who are destined for be let down.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Twitter and especially Reddit are absolutely AWFUL sites for people that want to have genuine discussion. The idea of karma or likes perpetuates a system where people don't speak their mind to the fullest extent, instead trying to appease the massages to get their updoots. Not to mention if someone does come by with a different opinion, they'll be circle jerked away while someone digs through their account to try to find something to discredit them with. It's not a big issue, until these platforms try and pretend to be for open discourse and discussion. Say what you will about 4chan, 8chan, etc. But no point system and full anonymity allow actual discussion between parties without the minority being silenced. I'm 100 willing to provide examples and hopefully reach a conclusion with whomever wishes to reply, and look forward to doing so.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Specifically I am thinking of the right to free speech, the right to assemble, the right to due process, and the right to vote. Right now in Washington there is serious consideration to restrict an individual's Constitutional rights based on being placed on a terrorism watch list. The proposal so far is to restrict them from exercising their 2nd amendment right to keep and bear arms. I believe that if that proposal was to be passed, then it should also restrict all of the other Constitutional rights. If the logic of the proposal is that anyone included on that list is dangerous enough to not be allowed to own a weapon, then they should also be considered to dangerous to be able to speak freely. A single man with a weapon can kill 50 people, but if this person was allowed to spread his philosophy he could be exponentially more dangerous by recruiting others to join his cause. These people should also be denied to freedom to associate assemble due to the danger of them planning a terrorist attack. It almost goes without saying that these people should also be denied their right to vote. Anyone who is dangerous enough to be placed on a terrorism watch list is clearly not someone who should have a voice in the workings of government. And last, since we are restricting Constitutional rights, why beat around the bush about it? If someone is dangerous enough to be on a watch list, then they should lose their 5th amendment right to due process. This is already implicit in the proposal being suggested since there is no due process protection related to the administration of the list. It just makes sense that inclusion on the list should be enough to entirely strip you of that right.<|CONCLUSION|>

Additionally, I feel that the arguments I've read about anarcho capitalism resolving the corruption present in society don't acknowledge the fact that a largely privatized society could result in an even greater concentration of power and wealth among the upper crust, and higher likelihood prevalence of corruption on all levels. I admit I might be reading into it wrong, so let's go ahead and change my view.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Feminists believe women are the same as men, except for some slight biological differences in the genitals. They don't merely want equal rights for women, they also want women to be treated the same as men socially and culturally. I think this is bogus. Feminism grew big between the 60s and the 80s, when people strongly believed in the malleability of society and nurture was chosen above nature. This is false. Modern research has shown that personality and behavior are far more dependent on biology brain, genes than previously understood. There are significant differences in general between male and female brains. In the past all males had to act masculine and females had to act feminine. Instead of ending gender stereotypes, feminists have created a new unisex stereotype letting females behave more like males and letting males behave a bit more feminine. Both options are wrong and harmful. In reality many males seem to be predisposed toward masculine behavior for example aggressiveness and competitiveness , and the same holds true for females and feminine behavior. On average, boys just have more testosterone in their bodies. Not all of them are aggressive, and there are aggressive females too, but if you're looking at big groups, there is a significant difference. So if there are more male boxers, criminals, politicians and businessmen than females, that might just be biology, and not 'the patriarchy'. The idea that women are exactly the same as men seems to be harmful. Women should be fully equal in political and legal rights, but it's not 'wrong' if a certain group a job or a community has more males than females, or vice versa. Some governments try to 'correct' this with quotas, and I think that's harmful. I don't think we should strive for a unisex world I think we should learn to accept feminine males, masculine females, feminine females and masculine males.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>Tidal energy<|ARGUMENT|>Tidal energy does not require any fuel. Tides rise and fall naturally every day, and so supply a free source of energy. Therefore, once a tidal energy plant is built, the energy extracted from it is virtually free. This compares favorably to coal, petroleum, or nuclear power generation, in which fuel must be drilled for or mined (which takes energy and money), filtered or refined (which takes energy and money), transported (which takes energy and money), and burnt for energy (which has environmental and subsequent economic costs). This means that fossil fuels have a price while tidal energy is a free energy source.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>My brother is a staunch monarchist. He is going to an event in a few days where he will meet our local representative to the Australian House of Representatives to ask for a portrait of the Queen. I'm not kidding Members of the Australian House of Representatives really are required to give out free portraits of the Queen if requested hint hardly anyone ever requests these . His rationale for this is gt Patriotic Americans fly the American flag in front of their house to show off their patriotism. Why can't I show off my patriotism by requesting a portrait of the Queen and displaying it in our living room? In contrast, I am a republican by that, I mean that I support the idea of Republicanism in Australia These are my views on this topic If you want to show off how patriotic you are, putting up portraits of a non Australian citizen is the exact opposite way to go. I also oppose personality cults and dynastic politics and a de jure royal dynasty doesn't stop de facto dynasties of politicians . Some Australians would even say that monarchism is inherently un Australian, going against the Australian belief in a fair go . I believe that it's understandable why patriotic Americans fly the American flag in front of their house because it's their nation's flag, not that of another nation, and it's completely separate from personality cults and dynasties. However, since lots of people accuse me of closed mindedness, I need to prove that accusation wrong by opening my mind to the opposing arguments. Therefore Why should I consider the Queen Elizabeth II Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms as a symbol of Australian patriotism? Why should I support dynastic monarchism and a personality cult?<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Let me start of with a miniature rant. Why is is that soldiers peace keeper with military training are sent overseas to police in other countries, while the actual police get barely half the training and they police our own citizens? It doesn't make sense, our people deserve the highest level of protection, our own governing body should care more about the lives of its citizens than that of another country. Now lets narrow the viewpoint. In the event of a mass shooting. Military training vs police training to take down armed assailants in a crowded suburban or metropolitan area. Seems like an obvious choice. Okay now thats pretty extreme. Switch the scene. A domestic violence call. One officer responds and the wife is bleeding and the male is on edge. With a physical altercation being a possibility wouldn't someone with high level of hand to hand combat skills be preferable to end that struggle quickly, should one arise? Lets switch the scene again. A protest is getting out of hand, police have a line and the protesters may get violent. Soldiers have been trained to deal with crowd control and their much more rigorous training would keep them much more level headed in a high stress situation like this. Just one more situation please, a local thing that happened recently. Two adolescents tried to steal beer from a store and the cops were called. An officer stopped them and a kid came at him with a skateboard. The kid was shot and killed causing public outrage . I'm just thinking, he was shot because the officer was protecting himself. But if the officer had been more confident is his ability to fight back without the use of lethal force this kid may have been saved. I don't want police militarization i just want people who are as highly trained as possible to protect the citizens of my country. Please debate this with me, I don't understand what stopping it aside from public backlash from police militarization<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>The 2018 IPCC report that has been criticised by some climate scientists for being too conservative in its estimates of how much change needs to occur says that we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally by 45 by 2030 to keep long term temperature increase below 1.5 C a level that would be extremely harmful to the environment but not catastrophic. If we fail, human civilisation as we know it could crumble and millions or even billions of people will be severely negatively impacted. x200B And I'm convinced we will fail, unless top down change occurs now. x200B It isn't impossible for those in the west to cut their emissions by 45 . Becoming vegan, stopping flying, buying an electric car and fitting solar panels will probably achieve it. For the sake of argument, say that for the 25 most polluting individuals, a 90 cut in emissions is manageable though it would be costly and remove many pleasures from life by 2030. To reduce this groups emissions by 45 , half of this group would have to reduce their emissions by 90 whilst the other half kept their's level. x200B Sounds possible? Yes. Just about, especially given that if more people reduce their emissions, each individual only has to reduce their emissions less if all of the 25 reduce their emissions, then they only have to do so by 45 . This would still require huge social change across the west that is unlikely to occur given the difficulties and costs involved in reducing CO2 emissions by this much. You can't stop flying if it is absolutely necessary for your job, and veganism can be especially difficult for those with further dietary conditions. x200B But we've forgotten the remaining 75 of the world's population. Whilst this group emits less emissions per capita than the 25 , they also need to reduce their emissions by 45 . This group have lower emissions to start with, so need to reduce their emissions by less, but it will be a lot harder for them to reduce their emissions. They are generally significantly poorer than the 25 , and live in areas with less infrastructure. You can't drive an electric car in an area without a stable electricity grid. You can't become vegan if you're a subsistence herder. You can't stop flying if you don't already fly. You can't afford to buy greener products if you're already choosing whether to pay for rent or food each week. x200B It gets worse. Over the next decade, many in the bottom 75 will become richer. They'll have more money to spend, and will acceptably use it to increase their quality of life. This will certainly increase their emissions. This then has to be balanced through even greater emissions cuts from the rest of us, and the more emissions you cut, the harder it is to reduce your emissions further. x200B And we can't stop at 2030 either. We've got to keep decreasing our emissions after then. As I said before, it will just get harder and harder. x200B Personal actions are pointless, unless those personal actions are demanding that governments actually do something about this say, close all fossil fuel power stations, open carbon neutral factories to build electric cars and faster trains and ban flying . x200B I want to be wrong, and I want my choices to mean something. Can someone please convince me they will?<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Is enlightened despotism superior to democracy?<|ARGUMENT|>If policy can change on a whim then investors may be uncomfortable investing which would hurt the economy<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>The marketplace of ideas, as I understand it just to be clear, is basically the idea that we should have as few restrictions as possible so that the best ideas are free to beat the bad ones in fair and open debate. From this comes the idea that all speech should be free because even if it's bad people will come to realize that it's false and unworthy of consideration so long as good ideas are allowed as well. Whether or not some forms of speech should be restricted is a separate issue, but I do have problems with the mechanism through which free speech and in particular free speech absolutism is often justified. The MOI supposes that ideas, if they are good and well articulated, will win out over bad ones, but to me it seems as though the very existence of long running political debates at all disproves this. If good ideas truly won out over bad ones, then the only reason why someone could possibly disagree with someone else would be if they don't know their opponent's positions and reasonings, seeing as they'd convert upon exposure to the better idea. Obviously, people still disagree even if they know all the opposing opinions, and of course there are plenty of reasons why people believe or do something that have nothing to do with rhetoric such as personal self interest, identity, party loyalty, tradition, nationalism, etc. . This has led me to believe that free speech is generally ineffective under the MOI model, at least with specific regards to large political issues like gun control or abortion. The increased sorting of online communities into echo chambers and media bubbles further convinces me the MOI does not function as intended the premise that good ideas win out only works if people aren't already satisfied with the bad ones and never seek out anything better, whatever that may be. For all the talk of discourse , most op eds or opinion videos seem to talk completely past each other. Talk show panels do not negotiate positions with other talk show panels they speak to their audience about how they're already right. Even articles and videos made in specific response to someone else seem to be intended more to their own audience than that of someone else, a way of bashing the other side than trying to communicate to it. Even in literal debates, the purpose seems to be more about winning than convincing someone they're wrong. The Presidential debates aren't so that the candidates can all discuss what the right policies are and come to genuine compromise. It's so that they can humiliate and destroy their opponents on national television for the pleasure of their followers at home, as well as show party elites who to watch out for or throw their weight behind. Rather, I'd argue that the purpose of free speech is not convincing others that they're wrong, but spurring people who already lean in your direction to act. For example Fox News doesn't write op eds because they want to convince liberal readers to become conservative. They write op eds to fire up their conservative readers, because that's mostly who reads what they make. If they can convince their base that they're right, it makes them more passionate to act on the things they already wanted. Vice versa for liberal publications they don't call this or that conservative politician bigoted because they want Republicans to not vote for them out of disgust, but because they want their Democratic base to vote for the liberal candidate. Oftentimes, speech will be brushed off as virtue signaling or fake outrage , but I think that this is actually closer to the actual function of speech than the MOI it helps show others what your beliefs are and inspires people who already agree with you to become angry enough to actually do something. Very few articles seem to be honest attempts to convert people and just seem to be attempts to rally people who already agree with each other. Even articles like Why lt insert policy here gt is best really seem to come off as more like reasons why you're right the way I see it.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Money, Parents, Neighbourhood, Education all of those have been shown to have a significant impact on the future of a child. x200B Sure those are all factors to the future, but changeable with only so much effort. Give Money to everyone, so they are on an equal basis — Unrealistic. Take children away from 'bad' parents and give to 'better parents' — Self explanatory. Education — Sure, imo the second thing in my opinion we should change. Here's the catch. With great educational systems, great professors, or teachers for example are great to children who want to learn, however, there are too many that don't even want to do that. And I personally think that especially those in the poorer regions think the wrong way of education. Be that 'it is boring' or 'I don't want to be a nerd' or 'What can I change in the first place'. So great teachers neglect can't help those 'unwilling' children. Now the interesting point. If a child has the attitude, towards learning is interesting, enriching in a fun, social and yes even monetary way, learning is totally different from what it was previously. And for the time in which teachers, universities and colleges are not as great as we want them to be, those with the attitude will work around that problem, because they don't need the fast moving car to get far, they'll get creative because they want it , not some very motivating teacher. I've personally experienced those who have an interesting open attitude towards really anything, appear to be open towards any area, which makes them a great person all around. They are energetic, because they don't loose the drive at some point, because they think it's useless. They can have great conversations because they have this attitude which generates interesting approaches towards many things. Those features, in my eyes, seem to be good for job interviews, relationships, normal friend to friend conversation, normal stranger to stranger conversations, science. x200B I'd love to hear what you think about that.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I have recently been studying epistemology a lot, and I've come to the conclusion, that there are no good reasons to believe that there is any kind of spiritual supernatural world beings besides the natural one. I myself, have been a christian for nearly half of my life, and I've been primarily using my personal experiences as a reason to validate my belief in the existence of a God. Although the more I thought about them, the more I understood that I had no reasons to ascribe them to any God, elf or ghost. I've very often talked with my friends and even priests about their belief in a God, and usually it boils down to it's just a matter of faith , which I argue is not a good reason, because you might as well use it for any claim about the world we live in. <|CONCLUSION|>

I completely understand that it does refer to black people currently, but it's used as a way for a black person to talk about peers, other people of the same race, but a lot of black people have called white people niggas. So what does it mean when a black person calls a white person, or another race a nigga? It obviously can't mean black person, or even black slave, so why aren't any other races allowed to say it? Also, when I talk about racism, I'm talking about the definition in the Oxford dictionary, and not the general omg u compared this black person to that black person thas raycist gt Noun Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior. I believe not that all races are equal, or even that all humans are equal. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, and I also believe that I'm being prejudiced by believing all humans are equal because I'm only doing such a thing because it's said so frequently. So yeah, before I deviate a bit like I usually do, let's see if anybody can change my mind.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I have a degree in criminology and poly sci. I am well aware of the massive corruption, waste, and bias in the US Justice system from the street level to the courts. I recently watched a documentary however that showcased prisons in European countries. I was baffled at the fact that people who commit the most heinous of crimes are sent to prisons that are nicer then hotels I've stayed in. For example this man murdered 50 children, and only is severing 21 years as that is the max sentence in Norway. I fully support the idea of rehabilitation with punishment but I do firmly believe that there needs to be some sense of punishment for certain crimes. And I do believe that certain crimes are so reprehensible and evil that the person who carries out such acts has no place in a civilized society. Change my view EDIT Thank you for all the responses This is the first time I’ve ever posted here and it seems like a great community to get some information. I will admit in regards to the case I cited that I studied criminology in the United States and we just barely touched on systems outside of the United States so I was unaware that he will be reevaluated every 5 years after the initial 21. I have accepted through the responses that it only makes sense to do what is right for society to reduce recidivism rates that is proven through European techniques among other major components like the lack of social and economic inequality. Here in the United States it’s a cultural ideal held that a person should not just be rehabilitated for their crime but they should also be punished. A commons sediments damping Americans I often hear or see in regards to these crimes is that “why should have person enjoy any freedom or life when the person s he murdered no longer do” and also “harsher punishments deter crime” Which I know to be false . I think it’s just a cultural difference here in the United States that would be very hard to justify the people. To be honest you could present all this information to most Americans and I think it would be fair to say that they still agree that that person should not enjoy life in any sense whatsoever because the people they commit a crime against cannot.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Simply put I feel white people don't deserve their own countries anymore. It's like a parent scolding a child, You played rough, you don't get to have big boy toys anymore. As it stands, I think people in the future will look back and realize that, historically speaking, white people are the most evil race and have contributed more suffering and disaster than any other people in the world. Wherever they go they oppress and destroy. Everyone else just wants to live simple happy lives in places like North America or Africa, but white people are always the ones to take that away. Well I think now it is our turn. It's time to take the keys from whites until they can prove they are responsible enough to handle nations again and overcome their bloodthirsty nature. Think about it, would there really have been not one but TWO world wars without white people? Seriously all they do is kill, everything else is just a shortcut to more killing. So yeah. I feel that the white population has to go down, nothing violent like they do but they just should breed less and meanwhile everyone should be making more of the percentage. This way eventually we can kind of shepherd them along instead of letting them run wild. I think it's already starting to happen and that this is a good thing. However, some of my admittedly white friends tell me this is racist and really it's creating a lot of tension with my friendships. I want to get their side of the story and see if that can change my view.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Tourism is the major economy for many countries all over the world, especially developing ones. While it does provide people with jobs, and is effective in certain areas, I believe in it's most popular form it is not sustainable for the long term and does local economies more harm than good. I'm talking about places like Las Vegas, Cancun, island resorts, large casinos on Native American reservations, etc. Governments and large corporations use up natural resources to support the growing tourism industry, slowly destroying local heritage and the environment. I think that resorts have a high potential to fail and are not sustainable long term because there is no demand for them, especially in the wake of a global recession. That's why surrounding a lot of tourist areas, locals are actually really poor . Basically people can't afford to go on vacation gt resorts make no money gt locals are out of work or not paid well gt there are no other jobs because the entire economy is built around the tourism industry. Meanwhile, the development of worldwide resorts that are all the same eats up resources, damages the environment, causes dehumanisation of people and institutions and homogenises the travel experience. Is there anything I'm not considering? Can anyone provide evidence that these things are actually good for local economies long term? gt Hello, users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators.

I've heard projections saying that if Sanders is to win though pledged delegates, then he'll need to win key primary states like New York with 70 30 margins. He won't be able to make up losses in California should he lose this upcoming primary.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>The Cynics of Greece rather than the modern understanding Modern cynicism is the disbelief in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions, while ancient Cynics believed in rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, sex, and fame. One could believe, perhaps incorrectly , that Cynics perceived proselytizing conventional higher values as stupidity rather than maliciousness. Ancient Greek Cynics preferred to live a simple life in poverty in the streets free from all possessions. For example, Crates of Thebes gave up riches to live in poverty and even had sex on the streets in broad daylight. The Cynics lived their philosophy of rejecting convention. Cynicism is among the ancient and modern languages, literature, philosophy, religion, and visual and performing arts such as music and theatre, taught in the humanities subject. Much of it based around people who lived and breathed and often suffered for their subject. In the past, the rich believed in the intrinsic metaphysical value of all this knowledge so much that they patronized colleges and universities so it could be taught and learned. In the US, this belief has lead to the conventional wisdom that it's not even just the humanities and all other pure knowledge disciplines that have an intrinsic metaphysical value, it's education itself. So much so that it was decided to also support the pure knowledge disciplines with public colleges and universities. By putting a price on them. And by decided to teach what was lived and even named for it's very humanity, with dry textbooks and standardized testing. And, often, by requiring them rather than leaving the question over whether they are worth learning to the students. And by giving loans so more students could more easily take part. And by continuing their support all the way into this day and age when the internet could provide the exactly same pure knowledge for less or for free . Even now, criticizing pure knowledge disciplines being routed through public college university education is met with arguments of the intrinsic metaphysical value of education. All this without realizing that forcefully conflating the metaphysical value of the pure knowledge disciplines, with the real cost and dehumanizing standardization of the public college university education system, effectively strips away much or all of the metaphysical value of the disciplines and renders them nearly or completely worthless. And, now, they're reaping these hypocritical, sophistic, superfluous, stupid seeds they've sown and become dissatisfied with how the intrinsic metaphysical value they tried to add to their offspring, students and fellow citizens didn't bear enough real world fruit. The situation brings a visions of Cynics laughing and dancing in the streets at the prospect of everyone getting their just deserts for their massive, arrogant bastardization of education and confirmation that, yes, those who proselytize conventional higher values aren't worth listening to.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Hello, CMV I bring this to light as it has been on my mind for a long time now. I believe this subreddit could aid me in changing my mind on something that I have found most people disagree with me on. The topic at hand is celebrities famous people in general, no specific group like moviestars are often found moaning and complaining about going to the store, being spotted by a fan and asked for a photograph. I've seen dozens of twitter posts or other interviews of celebrities claiming they should be 'left alone in public ' Let me preface this by saying, I do NOT condone the paparazzi or crazed fans. So what exactly do I mean? I feel I can best demonstrate through examples. One of my first and what brought this to mind at first was Louis CK's AMA. In it, he states something along the lines of Sometimes I just want to go get coffee without being asked for a thousand photos It seems to me that is a bit over the top, don't you agree? What I mean is this Celebrities since cameras have been available to nearly everyone, have been asked for photos. Your ENTIRE career is made from other people liking your work. If you live in a large place like NYC, there are going to be people who recognize you, and most just say hello, a few might get a photo. When you make MILLIONS of dollars a year, it seems a bit of a stretch to tell people no when they are part of the group that got you where you were in the first place. I do completely understand how it could drive people a bit mad being stopped often for photos or a chat. However, asking them to 'walk and talk' or keep walking while saying 'yeah, go ahead and grab your camera' doesn't seem to be the biggest trouble. I have two more examples, but I might rush them as this is a lot of stuff to read Another example was a female celebrity don't recall her name at a pharmacy getting medicine, a fan had saw her and asked for a photo, she looked beyond annoyed in it and later even posted on twitter IF YOU SEE ME AT THE PHARMACY, DO NOT ASK ME FOR A PHOTO. UGH. This is out of line, she didn't seem to be a huge star who gets stopped 24 7 like Ryan Gosling might so she most likely isn't overwhelmed by fans who help her in making hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars a year. The second one is Tyler, the Creator. He has a song specifically about this kind of thing He mentions a fan at Six Flags wanted a photo and he immediately went on to say he just 'wanted to go on rides ' I'll admit, later he says how the guy posted on twitter and suddenly Tyler was swarmed and couldn't enjoy Six Flags, which I do think is enough to complain about. Finally, I do hope you kind folk of CMV could change my view. I think it sucks when you are swarmed or harassed by fans, but to make such a big deal out of a handful of folks saying hello and asking for a photo is bizarre to me. Thank you. EDIT I would like to thank everyone in the comment section for changing my view If you would like to know why I will put it like this When someone wants to pursue an acting career, they can do it for the love of it or maybe for money and fame. No matter their decision, they deserve a level of privacy. Yes, I did say that they continue to do movies, however, this was me not realizing things like cult classics. Brad Pitt knew he would act in Fight Club and get fans and money but didn't realize it would explode into what it is now. I also acknowledge that when a fan sees a movie of their favorite celeb they are paying for the movie alone, although you may see them later and ask for a photo, they have every right to deny your request hopefully politely . Sure fans get them where they are but they do not necessarily owe it to them just because they went to their football game movie etc. Once again, thank you to everyone who commented. Although I may still feel upset when celebs complain about fans wanting pictures, I will talk myself through what I learned in this CMV and eventually have my mind changed almost completely. Thank you.<|CONCLUSION|>

Those who were uneducated voted for the tangerine nightmare. Preface 2 This isn't what we should do or what is fair, or what is just. My view is merely we would be better off in terms of the tangible gains. It doesn't matter if you are left or right, we just elected a guy who says vaccines cause autism, global warming is a liberal conspiracy and whose VP says smoking doesn't cause lung cancer. Even if you are on the right, there is no denying that this guy is a complete moron or at the very least, stands for way too many things that are objectively moronic. We elected these two because voters think NAFTA took our jobs away. 99.9 of economists know that to be false. We elected these two because people are worried about millions of immigrants poring over our boarder. Net immigration has been essentially zero from Mexico since 2008. We elected these two because people think climate change is a liberal conspiracy. 99.9 of climate scientists know this is false. People are too stupid to vote in an informed manner. They can't calculate two percent of a hundred, name the VP, name the 3 branches of gov, tell you the impact of NAFTA, tell you if CH4 is a greenhouse gas. Leaving issues of fairness aside and just looking at the tangible impact, we would be better off if only the smart and highly educated voted.

While I am part of the Arab and American culture this post is about any culture but specifically Arab culture. I really hope someone can change my view cause this topic just gets me rolling. First off to couples who are financially well off and if the guy is well off since in Arab cultures the guys pays for everything unfortunately and you both agree to have a big and pretty wedding then this post isn't really about you per say. First there are some people that take out loans for their wedding like why???? That is so unnecessary and if you are girl and know your partner isn't in the best of financial state and you still expect this huge wedding so you can show off then I'm sorry but you are stuck up. I swear some people think more about the wedding then the marriage itself. Sure a wedding is fun and all but it doesn't have to be so expensive and all out. At the end of the couple of days celebrating whose going to come home with you? Everybody that was at the wedding?? No it will be your spouse and reality will start to set in that you have to live with that person. Why do people care about weddings so much? I will truly never understand it. It's just a temporary wedding. Why don't you think about your own marriage? I'd rather save money and have a small wedding while being able to have a great honeymoon with just the 2 of us instead. I hate the fact that I might have to pay so much money for such a temporary thing. Sure a beautiful wedding is nice and all but a beautiful marriage is even better. I really hope someone does CMV cause this topic irks me and it's so annoying seeing people prepare so much for their wedding not think about the marriage instead. Please try to change my view about a dumb materialistic wedding that doesn't matter in the long run once it's over and reality sets in that you have to live with your partner and start a life together. Any questions please don't be scared to ask.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Since I live in a household with a very singular view on the subject my current view is liable to be extremely biased, but I am pushed to ask the question here because all research I have done has done nothing to help me understand it. I don't understand the cause and effect of inequality. Every time I have looked it up, it has been described in terms I find to be sort of indirect, but I get the gist that the unequal distribution of wealth leads to all sorts of problems in the economy and the welfare of people in general. What I don't get is when people compare the United States to Third World Countries and say they are on the same level in terms of income inequality and we should be ashamed. That seems nonsensical to me, because the overall standard of living in the United States is way better than those countries. I also don't understand how income inequality causes all the things it is listed as causing. Does the difference in wealth between the rich and poor really cause people to behave differently, or when people refer to income inequality are they actually talking about poverty? It is probably ignorant, but I have a hard time understanding why the difference between the most and least wealthy has an effect on anything, rather than just the standard of living of the least wealthy on its own. In addition, I do not agree with the idea of wealth redistribution as a solution. The top 10 already pay a hugely disproportionate part of the taxes in America, and it seems like taxing them more would only cause them to be more clever about avoiding taxes or just simply taking their business elsewhere. Note Reading some of the things that appear on this site, I understand that many of you will think this question I have as just a passive aggressive attack on liberal thought, but I assure you that I am asking in an effort to better myself and to gain a better understanding of the issue. gt Hello, users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Disclaimer I have not played a lot of Mario Party, and haven't played in a long time, so maybe things have changed since the last time I played it, but this CMV is based on my experiences. I think the Mario Party series is terrible, and would probably even call it the worst video game intended for parties. It is not skill based at all. The mini games are basically meaningless as you can lose them all and still win the game just by someone else having a lucky die roll and swapping stars with you. Likewise, you can win them all and still come in last place because you just had bad luck and couldn't get stars for whatever reason And there were PLENTY of reasons . It is mostly a game of luck, not skill, which in turn makes it a terrible party game, in my opinion. Monopoly has a strong luck element in dice rolls, sure, but there's still a lot of skill in deciding which properties to upgrade, if its worth mortgaging a property to buy a new one or upgrade one, and trading with other players Side note If you don't trade with other players when playing Monopoly, you're really doing it wrong . But back on topic, Mario Party is a shitty party game. CMV.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>ban sexist advertising<|ARGUMENT|>Consumers have a choice to expose themselves to advertising through their own personal behaviour. Advertisements can be ignored by the consumer and deleted at will. Interpretation of the ad depends on the attitudes of the receiver. The purchase and consumption of beauty products is the personal choice of a buyer. How ads attract and influence is determined by individual beliefs and values of the audience member. Some feminists believe that institutional power structures set up a "victim" mentality in women and fail to empower them by placing dependence upon power structures to make choices for women.1 If consumers wish to embrace the ideals or values represented in ads, this should be their choice. Therefore the right to self determine one's consumer behaviour should be left to the individual. 1 Thomas, Christine. "The New Sexism."

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I understand why minorities in America may want more representation in movies, but I feel, as one of these minorities, we don't really have the right to be too angry when we get replaced by white people or when white people get more parts in movies. White people make up about 80 of the population and it makes complete sense that white people are cast in these movies. In japan the entire cast is Japanese. In Bollywood the entire cast is Indian. Is it wrong for a dominantly white country to have a dominantly white cast? White washing probably shouldn't be done if the race of the character brings extra meaning, or if the character actually exists looking at Joseph Fiennes playing Michael Jackson . Maybe if a fictional character changes race this goes both ways between white and whatever other race its perfectly okay. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Why I dislike Xmas heightened materialistic behavior Black Friday people misinterpret the holiday Jesus was said to be born in Autumn time, not December 25th. Also some people look to receive rather than give It doesn't make any sense religiously As I said before, not Jesus's birthday, and Jesus was the most non materialistic person you could ever meet, he downplayed material items and wealth of possessions Every year we get the classic media attempt of the War on Christmas Happy Holidays or Merry Christmas ? honestly who the fuck cares? It's a clear marketing ploy. Especially Black Friday. Christmas music plays from Halloween until January it seems. And there's only about 10 popular christmas songs that play over and over and over during this span in anywhere at all that is a public area. It's incredibly stressful I'd rather not have to get people gifts in exchange not to receive gifts simply to get rid of that holiday season stress. CMV<|CONCLUSION|>

I grew up in a lower middle class family below the poverty line, my parents separated when I was about 8 constant fighting alcoholism and substance abuse until I was about 12, I worked my ass off, put my self through school with no financial help from anyone, now I have a solid well paying job. So sure I was born a white, straight csigender male I don't see anything in my like that leans toward me being privileged in any way and I find it infuriating and pathetic when someone points out those facets of my life in any capacity and attempts to make me feel guilty or condemn me for them.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>This only goes for Team Sports. I think that Player apparel needs to go away and shamed by fans and organizations. If you wear a player jersey, then, to me, you’re not rooting for the team, you’re rooting for the player. That’s not how team sports work. It takes the entire effort of the team to succeed and thrive, not just one guy. I know some fans aren’t fans of teams, but fans of players, like Lebron. I get that. You’re fine. Exempt from this conversation. It’s cheaper. If you’re going to get a name, why not get your name? You’re a part of the organization by rooting for the team, buying merchandise, tickets, food, and parking. They would not be there without you. As Mr. Herb Brooks said “The name on the front is a hell lot more important than the name on the back ” TLDR Player Merch needs to be outed because it’s not the player that wins it’s the team.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Hi guys, I know that the death penalty is controversial and tends to fall along party lines. Why can't we have a compromise? Let's say someone murdered one of your parents and lets say you don't personally agree with the death penalty. Whether the murderer is executed or not is largely out of your control, and it may only worsen your anguish to see them die. Conversely, what if the murderer is given life in prison, but you live in constant fear that they will escape and kill you some day? If the point of the courts is to bring justice for those who've been wronged, then why can't we give victims any power of choice when they alone must bear the burden of the murderer's deeds? <|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>Enhanced interrogation techniques<|ARGUMENT|>The Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its interrogators working abroad would not violate US prohibitions against torture if their methods avoided inflicting "severe pain and suffering". The main reason for this is that prisoners can tolerate a little bit of discomfort and even pain, but severe pain and suffering can have the effect of lasting bodily or psychological damage. Enhanced interrogations succeed at allowing interogators to inflict some discomfort and low-level pain - waterboarding, slapping on the belly, sensory bombardment, prolonged isolation all qualify as such - in order to succeed in obtaining critical national security intelligence, while avoiding the higher level "severe pain and suffering" that could be called "torture".[19]<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Depending on personality type, I think most agree that the closer you are to the middle of the table, the more involved you are in the situation and the more enjoyable it is, being as if you are on the end of the table you are limited to who you can talk to. Whenever I go out to eat with a group of 6 or more friends has to be more than 4 to have a 'middle' of the table seat , my best friend always comments if I choose the middle seat first, if I am first to the table. Its not a jab or an argument, i think it just gets under his skin. He usually just sits on an end or close to the end. I personally think nothing is wrong with this. I subconsciously gauge how comfortable I am in the given group and if I am comfortable with talking to everyone in the group I will choose the middle most seat if I am first presented the opportunity to do so. If someone else gets the middle seat I don't think twice about it and just fill in starting from the middle out. I don't feel as if i am just seeking the limelight because I have no problem sitting on the very end of the table either. There's some situations where I won't take the middle seat, for instance with family or if I am eating with people I'm not that acquainted with. To me it's just like calling shotgun to sit in the passenger seat of a car. I just consider it first come first serve. Edit Let's assume the example is a completely accessible table from all sides and everyone gets along with everyone and there isn't any emphasis on a specific person or persons at the table event. There are obvious situations where it would be conceited to sit in the middle if you're being an inconvenience to others or splitting up people that are only comfortable around each other. Im very conscious of these things.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I mean, I think it's pretty self explanatory. I think arguing or debating over any form of social media is mostly pointless and just makes people more angry. On top of that it's very easy to take what people say the wrong way or take it out of context. Has anyone actually had there opinion changed over politics on Facebook? I have seen friends and family members unfriend and block people over a silly debate on social media. If you actually want to change their mind sit down with them and have a conversation. You are communicating with eye contact without body language and tone of voice which, I think, causes people to assume the worst. People take the smallest things the wrong way, like putting a period at the end of every sentence, not using emojis, using to many emojis, not using the right emojis and all the other things we read into. Where as if you were in the same room there wouldn't be as much of a question as to where they are from. Change my mind. 😉<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I have a fairly specific look and location in mind. Side of the head, kinda wrapping around the ear. Either something Celtic mandala like, or black and grey realism maybe a design that combines both. None of the pics in the links are tattoos I'm getting they're just for ideas. And btw, I already have big detailed tattoos on my arms and legs. note I am not nearly as good looking as the folks in those pics There's the obvious things that people would say against a head tattoo Can't get certain jobs Social stigma Family disapproval I'm not worried about jobs. I'm the kind of person who will never work in an place that would have a problem with head tattoos. I am worried how people in general might respond. Certain circles of society not only don't give a fuck, but openly celebrate such displays of artistic individuality. These are the circles I run in. It's the rest of the world that worries me. How badly would a head tattoo affect me walking into certain businesses, working with people from very different walks of life, or law enforcement those who might choose to discriminate based solely on that? There is no way of predicting these things, and I've talked to people with head tattoos about it. Those I've asked say they've been fine. But is it worth the risk? My family probably won't approve. Although fine with tattoos everyone in my immediate family has them , getting one on my head would be going too far for some of them. I wouldn't be disowned or barred from interacting with the kids or anything. I'm an adult, it's my choice and they would respect that, but I respect and love them too, and don't want to create rifts. I really want this tattoo. It's been on my mind for years now. But I'm just so nervous. What would you say to talk me out of it? Edit No one has really changed my opinions, but the hesitation to get this tattoo is still there. I guess I'm just trying to figure out why. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Here my fundamental belief Gentrification is only a problem because people that are in the neighborhood already feel that their tribes area has been compromised. Gentrification is a natural cycle. Neighborhoods have low property value, people see an opportunity to invest, it attracts higher class people, and the area gets better. Seems logical to me. There aren’t any laws that are making this happen. It just makes sense. The only reason this is an issue is because people in these neighborhoods don’t want people of different cultures or ethnicities in the neighborhood that was for the most part homogeneous before. They used to be able to look around and see everyone was like them, and now outsiders are coming in and they don’t like it. However, at one point we considered this sentiment to be deplorable, but now this tribalism is being disguised with the label of “gentrification”. So, my view is anger of gentrification is a form of tribalism. CMV. Edit ok so after reading a lot of replies I think a better title for my post would’ve been “Anger at gentrifiers is a form of tribalism”. The anger I am talking about is toward the gentrifiers themselves.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I am a hard determinist. Determinism is basically the philosophy that the future has already been decided by the natural forces of the Universe interactions at the atomic level, gravity, etc. , and can't be changed. Everything we do, have done, or ever will do has already been decided. Nothing else can happen. But I can decide to pick up this cup right now You're not making that decision. The decision is being made for you, by the neurons in your brain, as a defense mechanism. Neurons are just electrically charged or uncharged cells. We have a lot of them, so we think we have a mind of our own and autonomy over ourselves. We really don't. Consciousness is just an illusion developed over countless years of evolution to help us outwit other animals. In the end, our brain is just a giant mass of particles. Therefore, there is a finite limit to its complexity. Sure, it feels like we have free will, but we don't have absolute free will. The future has already been decided. When you think of yourself as nothing more than a soulless mass of particles, I know it may shatter your worldview and you'll want to wholeheartedly deny it, but our minds are so simple that we just stop caring a few minutes later. Hell, after writing this post about how I'm nothing but particles and forces, I'll probably go and play Pokemon or something like it was nothing. Our brains don't give a shit about any of that philosophical mumbo jumbo at least not for extended periods of time. Our brain only cares about the simple things, such as survival, acceptance, and entertainment. So don't be mad at yourself for doing that stupid thing you did at a party years ago. It was bound to happen, anyway. gt Hello, users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Before anyone takes this the wrong way, I am not suicidal. I have so much to live for amazing friends, family, a better life than most on this planet are born into, I have a multitude of hobbies I enjoy, and I very much enjoy learning about anything and everything, ESPECIALLY physics, cosmology, and philosophy. Although I don't fear death, I appreciate deeply the gift of life and will make it last as long as possible while getting as much as a I possibly can out of it. It seems to me like the global consensus on death is that it is scary, to be feared. I know my family and friends are like this, the media seems shares this view I think 99 of the population would agree with the statement I don't want to die . Not me. Is it the unknown that people fear when they look upon death? To me, this great unknown fills me with nothing but excitement. Nobody knows what happens after death. Many skeptics believe that, essentially, nothing happens after death. The fact is that consciousness itself is one of the greatest mysteries of science, we don't really understand it at all. There's no way to measure it. Personally, I am confident that SOMETHING happens after death, that is, there is a future of conscious experience after the body and mind have died, but you do not retain any of your living memories so it isn't reincarnation you are an entirely new conscious entity. Remember that the concept of time is meaningless unless you are conscious. To state that nothing ever happens after you die is to assume that for eons and eons, universes upon universes, you never, ever have consciousness arise again, even in the simplest form. I'm having a hard time articulating my thoughts on this so I'm going to stop here, but hopefully you understand the gist of what I'm saying. Death is tragic in that everything you ever knew, loved, and thought is permanently wiped from existence. But at the of the day of life, to me, dying is probably the most exciting and incredible experience a person can have. After all, to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Let me start off that I am not a communist, hate communism, and that communism has failed miserably every time it has been tried on a large scale. I am a free market capitalist, and believe that the greatest threat to world prosperity today is Socialism Communism, but will be mankind’s salvation in a not too distant future 100 200 years . Communism has failed every time it has been tried. But why? Largely because people are inherently selfish, and because communists eventually run out of other people’s money to spend. To oversimplify, the main idea behind communism is that everyone contributes to the collective, and the collective takes care of everyone in turn. In practice, the collective takes care of the people at the top, and the people at the bottom have no incentive to do anything beyond the bare minimum. The old saying in the Soviet Union was, “the people pretend to work and the state pretends to pay the people”. When you collectivize a farm, output goes down as the individuals receive the same amount of food no matter how hard they work. However, we are rapidly heading towards a time where the individual no longer needs to work to receive benefits. Our rapidly increasing social safety net, where even the poor have air conditioning, healthcare, phones, and even cars is continuing to expand. Many countries are starting to instill a “universal basic income”, where the unproductive are taken care of by the productive whether they like it or not . Wealth is increasingly in the hands of the elite, and the drudgery of hard work is being supplanted in parts by robotics. What will happen if these trends continue? I believe that robotics will continue to expand in the developed world, and eventually spill into the third world. I see robots taking over the farms, the factories, and supplanting so many jobs that universal basic income is required just to keep the people fed. I see a world with underground nuclear powered farms and unimaginable prosperity where our labor is taken care of by robotics. Will wealth be concentrated by those who own the robots and the so called means of production? I do not see this happening. What I do see is a rising tide of prosperity the lifts all boats, with all people taken care of by automation. A universal basic income and set of “benefits” is likely for all, with additional wealth available for those who wish to work tinker invent, and a reasonable standard of living available to all. In this world, a communist utopia of sorts will exist for those who wish it, and a higher standard of living will be available for those who wish to work to improve the lives of all. tl dr Communism has failed in the past due to the innate selfishness of man. However, a robot or computer is not lazy. It gets no share of the wealth no matter how hard it works. It does not get tired, it does not get discontent, it simply produces in line with its creators wishes. As trends in labor and robotics continue and automation increases, the amount of people required to support the lifestyles of others will drop dramatically. As the social safety net of today increases, those supplanted by automation will enjoy a reasonable standard of living. We are heading toward a world wide communist utopia, and the world of our great great grand children will be better than the world of today. Edit Formatting<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I don't understand how so many people are against hearing it, against broadcasting it on tv, against saying it in front of children etc. At the end of the day, the concept of swear words are just a construct. The only reason we consider bad words to be bad is because we historically have done. Say the word Fuck for example. Why is it that this word more offensive than just the literal translation of sex? It is because we've been told it is. Why is Shit worse than Poo? It means the same thing. The difference is when you use swears at someone, rather than just casually. If you're not causing any hatred, there's no real reason for it to cause upset. Words only have the meaning that we choose to give to them anyway. The only sort of slurs that really have objective harm is one that incites harm to group of people races, sexualities etc. I don't have kids myself, but I wouldn't have any problem with hearing them use a lot of swear words because they don't generally mean anything beyond synonyms with other non offensive words. The only reason I might warn them from using them is because I would know that they could cause offense to others. anyway, so what makes non hateful swear words any worse than other words? CMV. EDIT I want to make a clear distinction in saying that I'm not refuting the fact that people do get offended by your choice of language. In this current world, it is a bad idea to use swears in the wrong context. What I am arguing, is that there's no real reason people should be offended by swears. There's no difference between me saying I had a shitty day and I had a bad day , but the first statement it taboo.

<|TOPIC|>the ICC is not an effective deterrent<|ARGUMENT|>By prosecuting only those leaders deemed ‘most responsible’ for the crimes in question, the ICC is effectively allowing lower-ranked perpetrators to commit crimes with impunity. These rank and file troops generally have little awareness or understanding of international criminal laws. Furthermore, just as local domestic laws fail to deter offenders who often commit crimes with little thought of being punished, distant ICC threats are even less likely to deter those whose actions are easily manipulated and controlled by militia leaders. Child soldiers, in particular, have often been drugged before going into combat.[1] [1] Mullins & Rothe, pp.782-4<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>As the title states, I am of partially Jewish ancestry and get most of my genetic makeup from that side. I have curly dark hair, dark eyes, olive skin, almond eyes, and the high cheekbones giving me the so called Semitic smile . Unfortunately, right now, I live in the U.S. and there appears to be a serious 10 25 chance that Donald Trump will be our next president. Now, keep in mind, while he has not ventured beyond mild anti Semitism of his own, he has still advocated for eerie measures against Muslims that echo the Nuremburg Laws that the Nazis implemented and as we all know, the Jews were not the only targets of Hitler . In addition, his wife said that a journalist who was met with anti Semitic death threats and statements that she should be put in an oven brought those comments on herself . Clearly, Jews are on the chopping block under a Trump presidency, and if ultra Orthodox types were to commit a large scale terrorist attacks, we might be registered and God knows what else. I am aware that his daughter is a convert to Judaism, but all genocidal and racialist regimes make exceptions even Nazi Germany and I think Trump would be willing to kill all 7 million Jews in America except the ones he knows personally if it were politically expedient. He already has a Lion's Guard militia which appears to exist to serve him, and is clearly not above inciting political violence, even agreeing to pay the legal fees of those who commit it in his name. His supporters have manifested themselves to be equally bloodthirsty, cheering wildly whenever a protester is attacked and booing any arresting police officers. As such, as someone of visible Jewish descent, it would be in my best interest to hide my heritage both in words and in appearance, and to arm myself with the best rifle I can afford and sleep with it by my bedside I have experience shooting them and will be 21 by Inauguration Day .

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>It is my view that Greed does not exist as it can never be objectively determined. It's all based on the perception of each party involved. Party A thinks they have just enough, Party B thinks Party A has too much. This is usually found in claims of a person having more than they could ever need. Who's to decide how much a person needs? In the past 3 years, I've doubled my annual income. Am I greedy? I was able to live semi comfortably before, so why did I need more income? If I'm not greedy, why is a billionaire greedy? Greed is completely subjective. Milton Friedman said it best with It's only the other side that's ever greedy. It's never you. I'd be open to the idea that \ everyone\ is greedy, but if everyone is greedy, then, in my view, the term has no meaning no one is greedy and people are just people looking out for themselves.

<|TOPIC|>Banning cell phones in cars<|ARGUMENT|>Paul Tetlock, Jason Burnett and Robert Hahn. "Ban Cell Phones In Cars?". Cato.org. December 29, 2000 - "Cell phone subscribership in the United States has grown dramatically in recent years, from 92,000 people in 1985 to more than 77 million in 1999. A recent National Highway Traffic Safety Administration survey reports that 44 percent of drivers have a cell phone with them while driving, a number that will only increase with the proliferation of phone ownership. We calculated that car accidents associated with phone use account for about 300 deaths per year. While small in comparison to the 41,000 annual deaths from car accidents, these deaths raise the question whether cell phone use while driving is justifiable. We think a ban is unwise at this time because vehicular cell phone use provides substantial personal and societal benefits, but does not contribute to a large number of serious accidents."<|CONCLUSION|>

If such fundamental things are just a product of our minds, then what else are just a product of our minds? <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I believe that if a person is seriously in so much pain, it’s understandable that suicide seems like a desirable answer. I think just about every suicidal person ever has obviously considered those around them and their context, and the impact it may have on others. They may identify that it would significantly impact others, or they may have a skewed view and believe that nobody would really care. Either way they come to the conclusion that their own pain is too great despite having empathy for those close to you if any and they shouldn’t deserve to suffer like this. Is it really their fault if their mind functions in such a way that they believe their pain is greater than the impact their suicide will have? Depression is a disease the same as any other and some people, despite all their fighting, unfortunately lose their battle. I do not believe that is a selfish thing to do when you consider their pain, although I’m being told by almost everyone that I ask that it is terribly selfish.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>So, a lot of hype has come up with Ethereum and some other cryptocurrencies offering smart contracts , where you can pay people on the network to do calculations for you. I believe that the potential market for this service is very small and specialized. Ordinary home computers, or even mobile devices, are more than capable of handling the average person's computational needs. When they aren't, outsourcing them is impractical. You can't outsource graphical rendering for a video game, because it's too time sensitive. If you outsource rendering for a cgi movie, you're giving it away before it's ready to be published. I've heard of homomorphic encryption, but I don't think it's sophisticated enough to handle a complete rendering job. Correct me if I'm wrong. The only thing that it would really be useful for is certain scientific fields, and distributed computing systems already exist for those eg SETI home . The introduction of currency is an improvement, but a minor one. I should be clear that I don't mean distributed file storage, such as that promised by the SAFE network. That I can readily see the use for. But I don't think distributed computing is anything to get excited about. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys and often hunting and pecking. I personally consider this a major problem because I think it is holding us back to some extent. Some points that I use to support this argument Faster typing more productivity, businesses would benefit. You could do more paperwork, more homework, anything on the computer. I'd argue that if everybody could type, we'd all have more free time as well, or at the very least GDP would increase as we get more work done in less time. It's useful for personal and professional activities Even if all you do is type posts on facebook and write an email to your grandkids, knowing how to type will help you. It's easy to learn. It's all muscle memory, and if you practiced for an hour a day you'd be good in a month. Plus there are programs galore for it. So, my view is that if university required you to know how to touch type, perhaps with a modest WPM test on entry, or at least a freshman year course, people would be forced to learn it and would become better typists, thus benefiting everyone down the line. Why university? Because minimum wage workers don't usually need to type on a computer, making it less necessary at the high school level. Also, in university, you'll be typing a hell of a lot. I don't care what course you take, you'll need to type up essays and ultimately a thesis paper. Am I overblowing this? To quote the great Mugatu, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. To me it's at least as important as learning how to write with a pen these days. I'd just like to understand why society currently seems to place no value in this skill, and that maybe I'm overreacting. Edit 1 Well, thanks for all the comments, it's been a very interesting discussion so far. The argument that's hanging onto me the most is that the keyboard may become obsolete, but I can't see that happening soon enough to justify ignoring a useful skill. For those who point out that we can learn it of our own free will and it's not the university's place, I feel that the long term benefits of such a policy change benefit us in the long term. Universities often require you to study other things they feel are beneficial, such as learning another language which is often taught inadequately , so I don't feel that it's outside the potential scope of a university to require typing. And for those pointing out that it isn't worth the time, I maintain that learning costs next to nothing, and it saves you time over the course of your life if you add up every time you type. Edit 2, View Changed u cheeseboyardee made the point that not everyone learns at the same rate and some people may not be able to learn to type well, and thus mandating it could exclude otherwise capable people. Thanks for all the posts and cordial discussion.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I've been reading the book Aurora by KS Robinson. It's a book about interstellar travel. A couple thousand people volunteers from all over the world set out to travel to Tau Ceti twelve light years away. At the speed they're travelling it's a multi generational voyage, I think the voyage lasts seven generations. This got me thinking of the ethics of birthing children in an environment which presents extremely limited opportunities to express oneself. It is also system that necessarily restricts the rights of those born there. For example, only a few people are allowed to have children at any time. Obviously, there isn't a market for violin makers, so each traveller's career options are limited as well. There's all sorts little restrictions that the people on the ship resent, though the one that irks people the most strangely enough, IMO is that birthing is restricted and requires approval from the ship's council. Most depictions of interstellar travel get around this by putting people into cryogenic sleep. This book's travellers are the first group of travellers to set off to establish a new colony, which means that there's a lot of work to be done during the trip. The ship's also transporting entire mini ecosystems that have to be maintained, there's a lot of engineering and math and farming, etc. Basically, cryogenic sleep is not an option here. So that means that people will live and die and they need to be replaced. Since there is no way that the children can ever consent to be born and to die on a spaceship I believe that they're being unfairly treated they did not volunteer to give their lives for this and to have their rights curtailed. I also don't see another way around this whole mess and I was wondering whether someone could change my view. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. I tried to make myself clear, but I don't think I've done a very good job of it. I'd also like to point out a couple of things that will not change my view 1 The free will is an illusion argument 2 Wormholes let's try to keep this conversation as realistic as possible. Edit 1 Most of the arguments are coming from a natalist perspective, which is not what my view is based on. Telling me that children don't have a say in their birth anywhere is not an argument that's going to change my view since I'm already aware of that. Instead, it would be better to focus on how whether the lives of the people on the spaceship could be meaningful valuable. Also, downvoting OP's comments is churlish and against the rules of the sub. Deltas awarded to u rollingForInitiative, u Impacatus, u IIIBlackhartIII and u Feroc for helping me see some of the things that would make the lives of children born on the ship meaningful. Consider my view changed.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I'm Korean American and I have family in Korea. I disagree with many of those I encounter who usually tend to also be of Korean descent when I don't get all too frantic about the idea of war on the peninsula. I feel as if this conflict, whether it is dormant or tense or whatever, must be dealt with in the future and we're just kicking the can down the road. Many people would die, regardless. People are dying under the famines and in the concentration camps. The longer we wait, the more people will suffer and die. Taking action as soon as possible would cause a high death toll but can potentially be made up for it by the fact that we'd be taking action soon and not whenever unexpected situations lead us to. Plus, it's arguable that simply leaving things be is 'inhumane'. Long term, a unified Korea would turn into an economic powerhouse. We have two countries with very strong work ethics, a country with a ton of technological advancements and billionaire tech companies, another country with a ton of cheap labor that can help jump start the economy after unification , lots of natural resources that would offset the costs, and infrastructure that must be built in the northern half of the peninsula. Some experts say a unified Korea can surpass Japan in economic power. I highly doubt China would be as uncomfortable having a unified, US influenced Korea on their doorstep like people say they'd be. It's not like people aren't able to fly from Beijing to Seoul or New York City they're aware of lifestyle in first world countries. China and South Korea are, contrary to popular belief, close allies. The number of refugees who would attempt to cross the Chinese border would probably be minimal if China expresses force in the region and South Koreans distribute food effectively and quickly. Furthermore, they know they'd have to go through sex trafficking and risk of death if they want to go through China and then go where? I have a very open mind when it comes to this issue. The reason why I am posting this is because I see others worrying a lot when seeing news of a potential resumption of war while I feel a sense of hope. But my thinking may be entirely backwards. I'd like to see opposing arguments to this topic. Thanks for reading<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Okay, so the title is somewhat apocalyptic and certainly hyperbolic but that is indeed the gist of my belief. With only a few minor exceptions and debatable ones, at that , Democratic Peace Theory is largely true. A quick re cap of DPT Essentially Western style liberal democracies do not go to war with each other. Not included in DPT but included in my theory is the fact that Western style liberal democracies rank the highest in nearly all important measures of development, from literacy to mortality to education to security to finances and beyond. It holds true that nations that reach a certain level of economic prosperity, and with it the accompanying representative and at least somewhat non corrupt political systems, do not fight with other, similar nations. If that is true, then it must be the duty of the West, who espouses these liberal, democratic values to convince or coerce everyone else into following these systems. We have seen that you don't need the institutional history behind Western European economic and political liberalism for it to succeed. Consider Japan Forced in the mid 1800's to accept Western influence, it proceeded to modernise, turning itself into a Western style imperial power. After the Second World War, under the guidance of the victorious Allied powers, Japan became a liberal democracy, and despite a near uninterrupted three thousand year history of totalitarianism and feudalism, the Japanese now rank among the most prosperous and peaceful nations on Earth. Similar examples can be found from South Korea to Chile to Israel and beyond. This all goes to prove that you don't need to be European, or former European colonies US, Australia, SA, etc. to successfully Westernise and thus fall into Democratic Peace Theory. If, then, it is true that A Western style liberal democracies are peaceful, prosperous and progressive comparatively , and B You don't actually have to be Western to successfully adopt the Western system, then it must logically follow that it is the duty of those in the Western style liberal democracies to spread this system, unique in world history, to every corner of the globe. To that end, and, truly, with great sadness, I believe we must be committed to the destruction of all other economic political social systems, or, if not the destruction, then the alteration of those systems to the point that they are compatible with ours which many people would consider destruction anyway . Of course, I am not advocating the death of the adherents to or physical destruction of the locations in which these other systems exist absolutely not It is my sincerest wish that all people could co exist in peace, prosperity and harmony, and I have immense respect for and interest in the works and accomplishments of all the civilisations that have yet arisen on our planet, from the Islamic Golden Age in Baghdad to the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history that brought us Confucius, Lau Tse and Sun Tzu, and beyond. Even so, it remains true that the countries of the Middle East as an example there are plenty of other regions of the world that are similarly un Westernised, like Central Asia, most of Africa, some of South America, much of South east and East Asia, etc. , with the exception of Israel and formerly Turkey worrying developments there, eh? , are neither liberal nor democratic, and this must be changed, by force if necessary. It is with this theory in mind that I advocate the West's cultural imperialism across the globe, and where necessary and possible, the West's physical intervention, in order to as soon as possible bring about a peaceful, prosperous and stable international order. Change My View, I'm intensely interested in hearing critiques and rebuttals TL DR Western style liberal democracies are peaceful, prosperous and progressive, and they do not fight each other. Because of this, all countries should be coerced or forced into becoming Western style liberal democracies. PS I hope this won't be necessary, but I will make it explicitly clear I am absolutely not a white supremacist or anything like that, and an Arab American or Pakistani Briton is every bit as Western as a French American or Scotsman, provided they are indeed Westernised.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Now, to be clear, I'd rather a progressive, grass roots takeover of the Democratic party. Third party voting should only be a last minute resort when the Democrats nominate a corporate beholden, Republican lite moderate. That being said, I reject the notion that it's impossible to have multiple parties in our current system. There were MANY elections in the 19th century that had three or even four viable parties vying for the presidency. More recently, Theodore Roosevelt waged a campaign in '12 where it was feasible that he could've won he came in 2nd place Ross Perot was leading every poll in '92 until he dropped out of the race, rejoined the race, and his erratic behavior came under scrutiny. So I reject the notion that it's impossible unlikely, but not impossible. I will say that the argument that third parties aren't viable is mathematically sound, but for some of us, voting for a candidate that contradicted a critical mass of our values, beliefs, and policy ideals is not something we feel comfortable doing, regardless of mathematical or electoral realities. Faced with two untenable options, voting “third party” sends a message to the Democrats that our vote cannot be taken for granted, and cannot be extorted, the latter of which in my view Clinton supporters rigorously tried to do during the 2016 election. If Democrats want progressive votes, they need to work to keep them, and not rely on a message of “Have you seen the other guys?” an actual message featured on Democratic bumper stickers released last year . This is particularly true when considering Clinton, whose lifetime political record includes Championing supporting policies no one would describe as progressive Iraq War, Patriot Act, ’94 crime bill, support for shady Syrian rebel groups in ‘11 ’12 overthrow of Gaddafi no fly zones in Syria fracking Duplicitously flip flopping on practically everything supported the Iraq War, then disowned it, sorta supported border fencing, then didn’t opposed gay marriage, then supported it supported TPP, then opposed it, then had her VP start indicating to donors that she really supported it said she was “open” to Social Security cuts, then said she wasn’t Insufficient commitment—and sometimes hostility—to progressive causes, unless they benefit her a great example is financial regulation “I told Wall Street to cut it out” still makes me laugh I’ve also never heard her talk about scaling back the Patriot Act Freedom Act, whose sneak and peak provisions disproportionately affect minorities, or ending reeling in our drug war, which also disproportionately affects marginalized communities calling tuition free public college a “free pony” etc. . Obvious and insincere pandering “Hillary es mi abuela” campaign the infamous millennial emoji Tweet using 9 11 to justify coziness with Wall Street cynically exploiting her gender to diffuse criticism at every turn, often to imply she wasn’t part of the “establishment,” which she represents in spades having her VP speak in Spanish during every media appearance etc. I was dating a Puerto Rican journalist intern master’s student at the time, and she called Hillary Kaine’s behavior toward Latinos “Hispandering,” which I still fucking love to this day The vicious, underhanded, and at times, borderline racist campaign she ran against Obama back in ’08 I would also argue that much of what makes third party voting untenable is that the populace has been educated to believe that it is “wasting” a vote so despite the fact that many, many people are dissatisfied with both major parties, they think “well, as much as I’d like to, I can’t vote for a third party, because no one else will.” It borderlines on being a prisoner’s dilemma. If progressives continue to vote for Democrats no matter what, they have no reason to move to meet us philosophically. If I hate a restaurant’s food, but continue to eat there no matter what, why should they change their menu for me? The only impetus for change they have is if they know I will either 1. take my business elsewhere, or 2. start telling people their business sucks. That’s what I’m doing with the Democrats, and that’s what I think progressives more broadly should do.<|CONCLUSION|>

Clothes also become more and more resource intensive to produce, as designers try to make their work more impressive.

In other words, one's race it carries no intrinsic value either negative or positive. Subjectively I further believe that if one actually does begin to take an intrinsic pride or shame in belonging to a particular racial group, this can only lead to bad results. If they take pride, it will almost always lead them to be exclusionary toward other people as a result of their race or even worse becoming outright hostile toward other races i.e. it will lead to racism. In they take shame, it will likely lead to them thinking less of themselves as a human being without any ways of alleviating this shame because race is an immutable characteristic . This will likely lead to depression of existential dread. How You Would CMV explain to me how there is objective value in being of a particular race or explain to me how one could achieve a positive subjective benefit from being proud or shamed by their race.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>It seems like people generally believe that drugs produce their own exceptional pleasure or euphoria which can be appealing and seductive for everyone. However, based on my own experiences, it seems that drugs aren't better than sober happiness. They can only seem especially good compared to an unhappy state. This implies those who find drugs especially enjoyable and use them regularly are probably unhappy in their baseline state. It also implies that anti drug people who view drugs as a trap or moral weakness are failing to understand how it is a result of unhappiness. Drugs are certainly interesting in terms of how they produce various diffrent experiences, and I think it's understandable to want to explore that. I'm just saying that regular use past that is a sign of unhappiness. Also note that boredom is a type of unhappiness. I've used a variety of drugs, though I have to admit I haven't explored the strong stimulants and strong opioids much. That plus the thought that others may experience things differently makes me a bit skeptical about my view. Though, I also think that people who disagree may just not really know sober happiness.

I’m not in the market for a new phone at the moment, but these are my thoughts at the heels of the new pixel unveiling. 1.A phone with a headphone jack has the same Bluetooth capabilities have a phone without. The only difference is that a phone without a jack doesn't have the option to have a jack without adapters. 2.If Bluetooth was actually superior I would already be using it over my wired headphones, but I don’t. Therefore my experience is going to be compromised to an extent 3.For the hassle from the above, I would need to have significant additional incentives elsewhere to buy a jack less phone. That could come from…. 3.1 Price Nope, prices aren’t significantly lower, if not increased. Definitely the biggest factor 3.2 Build Phones still fucked without a case anyways 3.3 Waterproofing Even though in theory, this is one less place to waterproof, devices are ip67 68 regardless of the headphone jack or not 3.4 Software? Not really a thing atm hardware? in theory, but nothing revolutionary has been added in place of that space yet, not even battery life.

Although, right now many in West might lampoon Asia, but the truth is centre of economic activity is shifting back to Asia. If these two countries plan and execute well they will end up shaping the new world order. Also, China is already an emerging challenge to USA and if USA continues to fall, it's end as world hegemon is near. On the top of it, USA has not been making wise decisions for a while, hence helping china indirectly. we have seen the Neo imperialism by China, it's affects are already being felt in Africa and Sri Lanka, Hambantota port was almost like a perfect example of same. When we talk about India, although it needs to cover a lot of distance, yet if it's play the cards right, things are quite possible. It need to contain the population plus focus on revamping the education system. Already, it has revolutionised the IT sector and Internet people have cheapest internet access here now, you get 1.5GB data daily in barely 5USD for a month Also, Asians tend to have an affinity towards STEM, while there American counterparts are gravitating towards useless Liberal Arts courses. Political correctness and tolerating the intolerant might further exacerbate the issues in the West.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Is transhumanism the next step in human evolution?<|ARGUMENT|>From the beginning of humanity, humans always find ways to evade evolution and escape natural selection's effects: by inventing medics, prostheses, vaccines, etc. Transhumanism is just another method, nothing different than what we've already achieved in isolating ourselves from evolution to begin with.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I am an ex Christian, and this statement is what made me change my religious beliefs. My friend, the first atheist I knew, said to me In are thousand years people could look back at Christianity the same way as we look at Greek mythology, while continuing practicing their own beliefs just as ridiculous. I thought more and more about the Bible and Christianity as a whole, and started to hate it. At Sunday School and Church I would read the Bible to find moral atrocities such as Genesis 38 8 10 where a man named Onan is forced to sleep with his dead brothers wife, and when he spills his seed semen pulls out to avoid her getting pregnant, God smites him. I would also find things we simply do not follow today. Such as Moses' 613 Commandments everyone except the extremely devout seem to forget about. Or Bible Communism which is particularly ironic considering the typical conservative Republican is Christian. I do realize that I focusing on Christianity more than any other religions, but that is the one I have most experience and knowledge in. I would not want to make false or ignorant assumptions about Daoism or Islam without doing more research. I am curious to hear other perspectives because I attend a Christian High School, and most of the responses I get to the statement posed above are vague or don't even address it.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I thought about posting this in Men's Rights since it's three times bigger than Feminism and seems a lot more active , but I don't think I'd get the kind of open minded discussion I'm looking for there. Whenever I'm reading through a thread linking to an article that depicts one sex in a negative light rape, domestic abuse, false rape accusations, etc. , it seems inevitable that I come across some MRA feminism discussion somewhere in the comments. The first few times I saw this happening, I tried to follow the discussion for any compelling arguments, but it always somehow spiraled into absurdity. I started skipping over most of those sections whenever I came across them, writing them off as a waste of time. Until one day when I was reading one of these threads, I came across someone who said, I really only read the Men's Rights sub when I'm on reddit. A quick look in his comment history proved his statement to be true. Then I started doing that whenever I came across a sexism discussion on a thread I was reading. I'd say 7 out of 10 times, the user's comment history had 80 of their comments in either r mensrights, r feminism, or r shitredditsays usually the former two subs, as SRS comments are always downvoted to the bottom of most threads . I've looked through several threads on both subreddits, and aside from links to interesting articles, I guess I just don't see the good that they're doing. The rational, intelligent conversations in those places are few and far in between name calling and berating seem to be commonplace, and this definitely spills out into the rest of reddit. Have I misinterpretted the point of these places? I see them as a little destructive and somewhat counter productive to their cause. Some of these users seem like impressionable people who have spent so much time in these places that their views are completely shaped by them. As a disclaimer I'm not gonna pretend I know what it's like as a man in this day and age, just as I don't think it's possible for a man to know what it's like to be a woman. I acknowledge there are assholes, idiots, and all around terrible examples of both sexes and that these people do not represent either sex as a whole. I kind of see these subs the same way as I see r atheism now they've lost sight of the big picture and have almost become parodies of the things they're supposed to be against. Where hivemind mentality breeds and overrides any sort of outside influence. And where there seems to be a common theme of users who tend to obsess over these issues above all else. Tell me why these subreddits are more than just circlejerks for bitching about the opposite sex. I'd like to know if there's some kind of positive influence that I'm missing. And I'd like to know if I'm being narrow minded for seeing those subreddits that way. Maybe I'm just as judgemental as I'm accusing them of being? Change my view. edit Holy crap this thread has exploded within minutes. So many good points and discussion on both sides of the coin. I have since changed my position and realize that the gender issues subs of reddit can have just as many positive influences on people as negative. The first two deltas awarded to this post by u HeyLookItsThatGuy and this post by u MyMRAccount. I'll continue to read and reply as the thread progresses. Thanks everyone.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Should high-income countries take in refugees?<|ARGUMENT|>Some refugees hold highly illiberal views / beliefs. If we simply accept any refugee who seeks entry, some will believe that the penalty for homosexuality should be death. Others will believe that apostates should be killed. Still others will believe that women do not deserve the same rights as men. People with beliefs such as these just cannot be safely allowed into a western culture that abhors these illiberal views.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>with a focus on the UK Using this as the basis of my view Groundwater Contamination AFAIK there has never been a case of GC in the UK over the 40 years it had been going on. The risk of fractures propagating and reaching the aquifer is negligible, due to the fact fracking occurs hundreds or thousands of meteres below the aquifer, AND that the pressure conditions required are very unlikely to be met due to the UK's shale gas hydrogeological environments Royal Society, 2012 . In addition, the failure of wells is considered the greatest risk of contamination. However, the UK already has a unique well examination scheme which provides independent specialist review of every offshore well, which could simply be provided for onshore wells too. Earthquakes The report concluded that seismic activity is no greater than that induced by coal mining. Global warming Banning fracking doesn't decrease the demand for fossil fuels. The same amount will be burned, with or without fracking. The only thing that changes is where it comes from. To be clear, I'm not arguing it's good . I just don't see how it is worse.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I remember grilling people for years that their votes mattered and, if we all voted, we could really make a change I've been thinking a lot about this recently and I realized that right around the time that Citizens United passed, I started to think differently of our electoral process. Today I feel that my vote really doesn't matter in the broad scheme of things please note a lot of this hinges on the fact that I live in a very blue state with very few electoral votes, so if I lived in a swing state I might be more inclined to see my vote as some sort of civic duty to showing up on election day, but nonetheless Faithless Electors and incidents where electoral votes get cast for John Ewards when it's John Kerry that's running for president really test my faith in our democratic process. So I want to abstain. I don't consent to the current way that our leaders are elected and chosen. I also don't think it's fair to be told that if I don't vote I have no right to complain about it To me, that sounds a whole hell of a lot like well, if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear and I think we should all take pause to really think about the meaning of phrase you can't complain if you don't vote. Shouldn't not voting be my way of not consenting to the process? Isn't it the only way to show my disapproval? How else could I go about it? I'm honestly hoping someone out there can give me something to chew on that might rekindle my faith in our current process because I'd rather be optimistic than jaded.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Should cannabis be legalised for medical use in the UK?<|ARGUMENT|>A lot of the benefit of cannabis comes from the [entourage effect]( of these compounds together, by simply isolating 1 or 2 of these compounds we potentially lose a lot of the medicinal benefits of the plant.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Across the studies we know of, women are typically more choosy than men, less willing to have sex at the drop of a hat, have more conditions for minimal requirements to choose a mate, more willing to walk away from sex, feel more confident they choose whether sex happens or not, do a tiny of active explicit approaching and so on. In short, it is women who primarily weed out men, men who primarily risk rejection, attempt to flatter, coax, impress, seduce, serenade, charm and so on, in an effort to get a woman to say yes. It is also primarily women who are able to exchange their sexual favors heterosexually in return for money, favors, gifts and so on. In short, women have more sexual power, women have more sexual capital, in most instances the sexual locus of control emotionally resides outside of a man's body. Had Elliot Rogers been a woman of comparative looks like his sister he would have been having sex easily and early despite all of his personality failings.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>USA shouldnt stop following its laws to convict people. There is a procedure, a due process to convict someone. The unabomber's cabin was entered into with a search warrant based on linguistic forensics \ this is unprecedented\ . So, all evidence gathered from the cabin should have been ruled out as it fell under fruits of a poisonous tree. Secondly, the judge, his lawyers, the prosecutor and the psychiatrists colluded to 'checkmate' him into a guilty plea. The judge said he wouldnt give him time to prepare for the trial but even then the Unabomber said that he is ready to go to trial and then the judge said that he is mentally unstable to represent himself.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Hello there Over this past week I've been reading up on free libre culture and piracy sharing, and thought a lot about it and read a lot of arguments on the concept of copyright, what it does, what it's intended to do, who it's for, what kind of behaviour it encourages in it's current form, etcetera. My previous view was that copyright is to protect authors and ensure they can make a living off of their work without someone else stealing it. It seemed a simple premise and based on all the arguments I had read from pro piracy and anti piracy sides it made sense. However this week I began to consider the viewpoint that I now believe copyright is meant to benefit the public, by being an incentive for authors to create works in return for being able to have temporary exclusive rights to their work, which feed the author if the idea is any good, and encourage innovation by other authors to think of new things, and by and importantly the author after the copyright has expired, so they can't just sit on a work and make no benefit to society. After five years which is arbitrary but small enough that I think that all benefit could be made from a work would be exhausted the work would be released in to the public domain for other authors to innovate upon. In this belief, copyright is to benefit the public and innovate. This is in contrast to the existing laws that have extended copyright lengths that do nothing but benefit the author and not have as much incentive to create new works, and crucially doesn't give back to society or allow building on top of it. I'd like to know the arguments against this as I'm still keen to have a well informed opinion. Thanks<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Mark Twain used the N-word in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Should it be censored?<|ARGUMENT|>A more reasoned discussion of the word would highlight the origin of the word and how it gradually transformed to likely adopt a dialect in pronunciation. The word of origin was negro, which in of itself was not a word that implied "slave." Given a southern and Cajun dialect then, the word could have developed as "spell it like you hear it" from the way it was pronounced. Understanding this could remove the attached stigma.<|CONCLUSION|>

There’s no hard incontrovertible physical evidence of God’s existence.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>As an intactivist sympathizer I do not support neonatal circumcisions at all the only exceptions to this are when a baby provably has a foreskin infection that circumcision can prevent. But absolutely no government money can go towards circumcisions. All neonatal circumcisions, or circumcisions given to anyone under 18 who cannot give informed consent , must receive no public funding and should be fully fronted by the requesting parent s or a charity as long as that charity is not funded by the government . Medicaid, medicare etc absolutely none of these services should fund circumcisions unless there is provably an infection that has or will occur in the baby that a circumcision is sure to prevent. If you think that circumcision is so great that you are willing to do it to a baby incapable of giving consent, then you should be willing to pay for it an unwillingness to pay for it is an appalling contradiction in this regard. I think it would be very telling if, after this were to be hypothetically instituted, circumcision rates in states that cover circumcision would fall. To make this debate flow easier, I will say that you can boil my view down to neonatal circumcision, outside of special cases, is not medically valuable enough that it should be covered by government subsidies . CMV EDIT To add in, I will expand it to include any major medical issues with the penis that may be resolved by circumcision. So developmental, infectious, long term issues etc EDIT 2 Since charities are tax exempt, I'll exclude any tax exempt groups from the criteria<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Is political correctness detrimental to society?<|ARGUMENT|>"Political correctness" implies that the purpose for modifying one's speech is to comply with public or popular opinions.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>The main reason I think that philosophy is useless is because, as John McDowell has said, the point of philosophy is to leave everything as it is . It is a passive intellectual pursuit that seems to tell you how things are, but upon closer inspection it turns out that those things do not have any bearing upon everyday life. Moreover, philosophy cannot tell you what to do. Moral philosophy describes ways to get to the truth about what to do, but these ways are already understood implicitly by everyone and so never needed to be made explicit. Therefore, there is no point in being interested in philosophy. <|CONCLUSION|>

While it is easy for countries and foreigners to state their opinions about Israel's security interests and how its actions may or may not fullfill them, Israel's right to make that judgement for itself must be respected. In addition, it is probably true that only Israelis themselves can fully understand their own interests, take heart of direct threats to their lives, and develop appropriate security imperatives.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Donald Trump keeps saying the electoral process is rigged. He's right about that. But the real rigging isn't against Republicans, it's against outsiders. The most obvious how hard it is for third parties to get on a ballot. Then you have laws against fusion tickets, which violate freedom of association. Then you have campaign finance rules which don't keep money out of politics, but do make it very hard for third parties to raise money. The voting itself is fair, but that means nothing. The rigging happens by keeping candidates from running.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I’ll preface this by saying that I am a huge craft beer fan myself. The craft beer market is a multi billion dollar industry that continues to grow year by year. However, it seems that this sort of growth is unsustainable. Especially when you consider how expensive these craft beers can get. I've seen as high as 15 for an 8 oz glass. I don't think that the industry is going to crash, but at some point one would imagine the market for some of the crazier, more expensive beers will dry up. I also think that there are way too many IPAs on the market. Especially because when they get to a certain point of bitterness, they all tend to taste the same. <|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Many corporations provide separate job applications and networking events for minorities, women, and members of the LGBTQ community in addition to the standard job application and networking events that anyone may use. By definition, which may vary depending on what dictionary is used , discrimination is the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex. Basically, my viewpoint is that it is a form of discrimination to allow different categories of people to apply for a job using a separate application, since separate applications may receive less applicants than the centralized application pool. Less applicants in a specific pool means that someone that may be ranked 14 overall may appear as the 1 overall applicant for that specific category. This would make people in the separate applicant pools face less competition and stand out more. An example of this would be that there are 100 applicants for only three open positions. Out of these 100 applicants, 20 are women that applied to a women only application. Basing qualifications on merit alone, let's pretend the top 8 candidates are Indian, white, and Asian males. These 8 candidates are more qualified to perform the job than the highest ranking female. Using separate applications, the woman that is technically ranked 9th overall would be ranked 1st overall in her group, thus propelling her into a larger spotlight than she would have received through one centralized application and increasing the chances of hire. The same can be said for specialized networking events or specialized internship programs for specific groups of people. Networking events for people of color may provide an advantage over other groups that were not presented with that opportunity. Internship programs for only Hispanics would be disqualifying anyone that is not Hispanic from participating. I expect many of you to use the argument of affirmative action and leveling the playing field due to the mistakes of past generations in history. I am aware of this argument, however, I am interested in seeing what people have to say solely based on the definition of discrimination and by focusing on the present. If affirmative action is your argument, please explain how it justifies having separate applications, and how that makes separate applications NOT discriminatory by definition. Here are some questions I have. Feel free to answer as many as you'd like In a society that fights for equality, how is this equal? How is this not discrimination? Is there something that justifies this form of discrimination as being acceptable? Would a separate application that said, White males only, be discriminatory or acceptable? Other somewhat relevant questions What is stopping a biological male from claiming to be transgender in order to apply to the LGBTQ pool, then after being hired, publicly state that they have decided to return to their biological gender? Should there be a law that would make doing this illegal? If so, how would you prove that you are aren't truly transgender? What if after that person decided to return to their biological gender they were fired? Would that be grounds for a 'termination based on gender' lawsuit?<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>They have some listicles and gimmicky content, but they use that to finance some of the best journalism in the entire world. They have numerous pullitzer prize winning journalists from places like the NYT and Pro Publica. Anyone criticizing them is using dated talking points or is a jealous hater. They are this generation's NYT and MTV combined. They have the best news gatherers and are at the forefront of the youth zeitgeist. They are A STAR FACTORY on YouTube and Facebook. Just look at people like Matt Bellasai super famous among teens and Gaby Dunn over 500k YouTube subs . They both were made by BuzzFeed. Yes, BuzzFeed has taken money from the Koch brothers but almost every big news org has one shady donor or two. And they don't do clickbait, despite what people might think. Since their ads are native they don't need to get clicks. They also don't focus on clicks anymore since they're moving to a distribution model. All the criticism of BuzzFeed is 2010 2012 era crap. Anyone criticizing them now is jealous that they're not good enough to work for them or ignorant.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Is Morality Objective?<|ARGUMENT|>Laws can be from internal sources. Many laws that affect the United States were written after its foundation by its citizens.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>After reading a lot about Utilitarianism I can't help but feel that in eating meat we are directly producing large amounts of pain, and therefore it is immoral. Peter Singer, another Utilitarian philosopher, argued that the best way to maximise utility happiness was by acting according to individuals' preferences. He said we have to extend this to animals because they are similarly conscious beings like us, and if they were as intelligent as us some are close then their preferences would to be not killed for eating. A common counterargument against vegetarianism is that it is natural to eat meat and animals eat each other regardless. I don't find this convincing just because something is natural commonly practiced or has been traditionally performed does not mean it is moral . There is no logical connection between these things and ethical ends like utility happiness. I don't think animals have the extent of free will that humans appear to have if humans even do have free will and they also often don't have easily available alternatives like us, so we cannot blame them. I'm basically looking for philosophical, logical or ethical justifications for eating meat. Note I'm not a vegetarian and I'm unsure of whether I'd like to be. gt Hello, users of CMV This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

<|TOPIC|>the right to anonymous posting on the internet should be protected by law<|ARGUMENT|>Citizens have a right to speak their mind without government interference – which is why in the offline world people also have a right to speak anonymously.[1] Internet anonymity guarantees that people can actually exercise their right to free speech: anonymity takes away the fear of potential political consequences. The reason why governments are cracking down on internet anonymity is exactly this: they don’t like being criticized. For example, China recently introduced a bill requiring ‘real name registration’ of every Chinese internet user, thus hampering free communication and the airing of political dissident opinions.[2] Conversely, internet anonymity has helped in the Arab Uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia: people used anonymising software like TOR to come online and communicate, organize and criticize freely without fear of political repercussions.[3] [1] Electronic Frontier Foundation, ‘Anonymity’.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I've looked through other CMVs and none of them really seem to address why piracy is actually legal. I understand why it's less wrong than stealing a car or a handbag because you're not stealing something physical and depriving someone else of using it , but to me it still seems unethical in the same way that fraud is unethical. You're essentially ripping off the artist and the record label who negotiated a contract, and even though no one is losing access to the music the artist label are still losing access to the money that is generated. The main arguments that I've seen in favor of piracy are that you're not taking something from anyone and the record label's pricing is bullshit because there is zero marginal cost. If you disagree with someone's pricing model, don't buy the fucking product. And yes, I am aware of the practical difficulties of separating illegal piracy from legally protected fair use like timeshifting what's the financial or legal difference between taping a song you hear on the radio, taping a song you hear on Spotify or Vevo, and getting the song from a torrent? , but from an ethical and moral issue piracy seems very sleazy to me.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I'm pro choice for both father and mother. What I mean by this is, when a child is conceived whether intended or not the father is put in an awkward situation. My view is that if the father would like to legally disown the child before the 24 week abortion period have passed, he should be allowed to do so. This would except him from being forced to pay child support if the mother decides to keep the child, as well as dissociate himself entirely with the child. In the case that the father wants to keep the child but the mother does not, she could conduct this same procedure, and instead of being forced into abortion could simply pass the child to the father upon birth. There of course are some flaws in this view but I believe overall it is better than the current system. It should also be noted that I am not some male rights activist trying to help deadbeat dads weasel out of child support. This system is a tool to help children being born who should have been aborted. EDIT Great responses reading through them now my opinion is very mixed but I'll try to respond in defense of this view regardless.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I have read a lot about near death experiences and have watched videos with people who had them. I have also read a lot of opinions on this topic by the sceptics. My conclusion is that while NDEs are not a 100 bulletproof evidence for the existence of afterlife by afterlife, I refer to the possibility, that a certain part of personal consciousness can exist after bodily death , I still think that there is enough evidence, that such option should be considered very seriously by the mainstream science. As evidence, I consider 1 frequent reports of psychic phenomena during NDE sceptics seem usually to ignore that, or simply say it's not reproducible or trustworthy 2 similarly patients having NDE being able to describe details of surgeries that happened while thay had no brain activity 3 people who had NDEs are usually completely convinced that the experince was real and believe in afterlife, reagardless of previous beliefs sceptics simply say thatm they're deluded, which seems rather closed minded, even smug, to me 4 similarly people who had NDEs often change their lives in some way and attribute that to the contents of the experince. probably does not logically imply much, but it's still worth considering imho . Further, it seems to me, that the sceptics failed to provide a resonable alternative explanation. Usually, they just dismiss it saying it's just hallucination of the dying brain or fraud , but never elaborate on the details of such claims. Please, don't try to CMV on the validity of NDEs, but try to CMV that mainstream science is ignorant of the available evidence and that the sceptics are rather closed minded. Or alternatively explain why all the evidence available is actually not enough to consider this possibility scientificaly interesting and disbelief should be pushed as the default opinion in science as it seems to me to be the case now.<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>Should Turkey Be Accepted In The EU<|ARGUMENT|>Turkey has a better history of democratic elections than a number of the former communist states currently negotiating their membership of the EU. Its recent election of a party with islamist roots has led to a smooth transfer of power, with no attempt at intervention by the secularist military (as in the past). Turkey’s human rights record is also improving rapidly, with the recent abolition of the death penalty and the removal of some restrictions on the use of the Kurdish language. These advances have been prompted by the improved prospect of EU entry if Turkey conforms to 'democratic norms', and this process is sure to continue to the benefit of both Turkish citizens and the EU if accession is offered in good faith.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>3D printed firearms are currently inferior to ones produced by firearms companies, yet history would suggest that technological improvements will usually be made when there is a demand to meet. I do not believe it is unreasonable to conclude that 3D printed firearms will approach match grade quality within the next 20 to 30 years. Tight controls or outright bans on 3D printers are against the public interest for a variety of reasons I won't get into here. I'll simply say that suppressing the growth of a new technology for the sake of gun control is absurd. I believe the age of gun control is coming to an end and alternative methods of preventing violence need to be sought out, or a certain amount of violence needs to be accepted as the cost of living in a free society.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Every genre has its period. The 1960s had Westerns, the 1980s had SciFi, and the 2000s and 2010s had have superhero movies. Things started off well in the 2000s. We had Spiderman, The Dark Knight, Ironman, etc. But now this genre just seems forced. Most of the movies coming out now are for superheroes no one has ever heard of. The movies get mostly negative ratings. Plots are lazy, acting is sub par, over reliance on CGI effects, etc. I just went to the theater on Friday to see a movie and 4 out of the 9 movie trailers shown are for Marvel movies which all look atrocious btw . Just stop already.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Does the Bible allow women to hold the church office of "deacon"?<|ARGUMENT|>John Calvin believed that the order of Nuns, which the Catholic church had started, was begun by Paul’s orders in [1 Timothy 5](<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>The Libertarian Solution: Can People Govern Themselves?<|ARGUMENT|>The supposed role of the government is to protect its citizens, but the statement in itself is patrimonial due to its origins in the past where patriarchy dominated, but some forms of universal government protection needs to exist, particularly in regards to military and partially economy.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Does God Allow Evil: Is the Existence of God Compatible with the Existence of Evil?<|ARGUMENT|>In [Numbers 31:17]( they are told to murder all the children amongst the enemies and any woman who might be pregnant.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I can understand disagreeing with tipping but don't think non tippers should be allowed the free ride they get from tippers. A waiter doesn't know who the tippers are so they treat everyone equally. But it is unfair that non tippers knowing that they aren't going to tip don't speak up about it. They allow the waiter to believe that they probably are tippers since the vast majority of people are tippers and enjoy the quality service that they may not get if the waiter knew the truth. They are being dishonest by not speaking up and they're piggybacking on the generosity of others.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Autonomous Killing Machines: The Future of Warfare?<|ARGUMENT|>It is easy to equip AKMs with cameras and microphones, so they could spy on citizens and transfer the collected data to the authorities.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I'm not going to say that white people don't want racial equality or want things to better for black people. I think most white people would want that to be the case. I just think that white people as a whole see all the negative statistics for black people and they see them in the real world and gain a sense of superiority. I'd like to believe that my view is wrong, but given my real world experiences as a black guy as well as my internet experiences as one, I find it hard for my view to be changed.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I need to preface my thoughts initially by saying that holding this view does not mean I devalue cheerleading in any way. I have attended competitions, and known several friends who cheerlead, and though I am a very active, physically fit person, I would still find it challenging to learn and execute many moves in cheerleading, and find it impressive and enjoyable to watch. However, I don't consider it a sport. This is not a pejorative assertion, but even so, I have experienced pushback for it in the past. I also don't subscribe to the Olympic definition of sport. In my view, a sport needs to be able to be won by objective means. That is to say, you need to have a goal that can be reached make it to a certain point first, score more points, lift the most weight, etc. Obviously, officials make wrong calls, and goals in hockey soccer for instance are wrongly disallowed wrongly given occasionally, but at the end of the day, there is still an objective result outcome, but for the number of games they decide on the merit of the mistake alone, I'm willing to consider them a reasonable minority. Team A 4 3 Team B, Usain Bolt wins race with time of 9.68 seconds, etc. I believe events decided solely by judges cannot be sports, and will always be subjective in nature. Sports like boxing, with judging elements, are still sports in my view because there is an objective way to win knocking the opponent out so they cannot respond to a 10 count, for instance. The judging is a tiebreaker, and I am fine with that. But in judge only events, an identical routine could win one contest, and lose another, simply by virtue of human subjectivity alone. For this reason, I lump cheerleading in with figure skating, diving, and other events as athletic activities.<|CONCLUSION|>
