<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I say this because there are many things that the fork is simply incapable of doing, but the noble spoon can do it all. The fork fails in the consumption of many things, as it can only be used in the department of solid foods, but the all powerful spoon can do solids OR liquids. The only thing the spoon cannot do is a few techniques such as twirling spaghetti. I love eating yogurt, and almost all of my breakfasts involve cereal with milk, so a spoon is very important to me. The fork is just unnecessary, like it is unnecessary to have a normal knife AND a Swiss army knife, just get rid of the normal knife for simplicity.
