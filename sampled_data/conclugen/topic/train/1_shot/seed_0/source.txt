<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>There's something about it using childish imagery, yet exploring adult things that I can't relate to. I've heard great things about these shows, but it just weirds me out before I can give it a chance. I feel the same way about anime. It's animated so it feels strange that it would not be for kids.<|CONCLUSION|>
