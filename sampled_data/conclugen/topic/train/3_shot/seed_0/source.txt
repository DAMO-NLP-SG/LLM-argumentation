<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Take LibreOffice, for example. It's a free, open source, mostly feature complete, MS compatible apart from Macros , more than adequate replacement office suite for Microsoft Office. It's theoretically more secure, as it's been fine toothed by penetration testers innumerable times, and security through obscurity as practiced by Microsoft is a terrible practice easily foiled by decompilers and reverse engineering. I would argue that the switching costs from MS Office, if there are any, are beneficial for all parties involved, because the LibreOffice developers would receive a massive resource, labor, and funding boost, in turn improving the LibreOffice codebase for others to convert to Open Source. Really, the only thing holding back this simple cost cutting measure is bureaucracy and vested interests. Why don't deficit hawks ever try to make easy cuts like this? Is Open Source just too unfamiliar and socialistic for them?<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>There's something about it using childish imagery, yet exploring adult things that I can't relate to. I've heard great things about these shows, but it just weirds me out before I can give it a chance. I feel the same way about anime. It's animated so it feels strange that it would not be for kids.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>So stereotypes are bad right? I don't know. I have always considered that they might be a heuristic and not an algorithm. That and I believe I ought to give people a fair opportunity to represent themselves and not hold on to my stereotypes. I thought about this today with the viral clip of Aziz's stand up about black people and magic. Clearly some stereotypes are more harmful than others. But the question with stereotypes is twofold. 1 Is it true enough 2 Would I rather not employ them even if they were useful? The first is fairly easily addressed the second is a much harder problem that I often struggle with because it is an issue with profound ethical implications. The benefit of being right might be nonzero and even high, but the cost of being wrong might be high but this is not a cost I incur. There is also a secondary issue of what behaviours I want to encourage. Anyway these are my thoughts.<|CONCLUSION|>
