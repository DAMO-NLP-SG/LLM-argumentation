<|TOPIC|>Should Long-term Solitary Confinement Be Stopped?<|ARGUMENT|>When Libya submitted an arguably dishonest report in 1995 - while at the same time persecuting expatriate dissidents - it took the committee three years to formulate an answer which expressed concern over the assassinations of dissidents. Libya ignored the comments and was elected chair of the committee in 2003.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Appointments to the US Supreme Court should be for fixed 18-year terms<|ARGUMENT|>It is likely that identification as a conservative or liberal is a significant element in the social identities of many and perhaps most Justices Baum, p. 8 this inarguably effects the decisions Justices reach.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>All Humans Should Be Vegan.<|ARGUMENT|>This could allow the people that lose employment in non-vegan industries could gain them in the vegan ones. It could possibly lead to more jobs than ever before!<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>The Libertarian Solution: Can People Govern Themselves?<|ARGUMENT|>Income was largely generated through tariffs, but the American citizens still lived with no tax on their income whatsoever, barring a brief income tax during and shortly after the Civil War.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Should minors be allowed to go through irreversible gender reassignment procedures?<|ARGUMENT|>Adolescents have less capacity to envision their distant future meaning they are more likely to place a higher value on their immediate desires.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Is the UN a force for good?<|ARGUMENT|>In August 1993 the United Nations and Security Council ignored a report by the UN human rights investigator for Rwanda who warned that a genocide might occur.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Private property owners calling a towing company to impound the vehicle on thier behalf and the towing company holding the vehicle for payment ransom is tantamount to theft and should be illegal. I am okay with a private property owner calling a tow company to remove a vehicle from their grounds, but only if the police are involved just as they would be if they were having a trespasser removed. In that case the towing company should only be allowed to move the vehicle to the closest available public roadway or grounds. If at that point the police deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a police impound lot.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>In essence, what is the universe but a very, very complex algorithm that provided with the exact same input, will always provide the exact same output? Of course, there is never really the exact same input ever because the time and position and other variables regarding the finite? infinite? inputs outputs within the universe are constantly changing, so there is no physical way to test this. In a thought experiment, if two universes that were identical in every single aspect were to exist, with the exact same interactions, no interference with each other whatsoever, they would play out exactly the same. Even quantum uncertainty would be determined, as I argue that the uncertainty is caused by the physical limits of observation on such a scale. Yet on this micro scale it would play out the exact same way in the twin universes, regardless of whether they can be observed. Then the micro scale would influence the macroscale, which in a butterfly effect style would affect other stuff. At the very least, what I'm trying to say is that free will of a consciousness does not exist, as all our decisions are influenced by all the factors around us and the genetic code which makes us within a finite system. Free will in the sense that choices we make are made something that isn't just a set output from a set input is false. Our consciousness is an illusion considering that we are within finite system of interactions and a larger system, for example a supercomputer could have the potential to completely predict one person's thoughts and actions 100 accurately given the all of the finite number of variables that influence us within our finite system. Sorry because I'm rambling at this point. This probably makes more sense in my mind. EDIT Removed some redundant words<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>As a college athlete I know how physically and mentally demanding it is to stay competitive in the classroom and in your sport. Waking up at 6 A.M. to get a morning lift before you have class all day. After class it’s back to the workout facility to get another workout in, and after that its time to head to the mandatory study hours they enforce. By the time we are finished with workouts, school and studying its 9 P.M. and time to go to bed. As a college student living on our own where is the time for us to get a job and make money? The answer is simple, there is none. So why does the NCAA put restrictions on they’re athletes allowing them to make nothing of the 912.8 million they made in 2012 2013? Without the players showing up to the games there wouldn’t be NCAA sports. Now I’m not saying we deserve to make a great income, but why couldn’t they pay us hourly. Say for every hour of practice or any mandatory event, they had to pay us around 7.50. This would help out a lot financially, and I don’t think it’s to much to ask for.<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Evolution shows us that animals need to use it or lose it e.g. birds becoming flightless when predators are not present Current technological advances automation, the internet, soon to be self driving cars mean that humans do not have to think as critically as they once did, knowledge is presented and consumed, and as long as it comes from an authority figure it is believed e.g. anti vaccine movement . I believe the Flynn effect is not completely understood, and more likely points to our ability to teach kids how to answer IQ tests improving, rather than IQ itself increasing. We're teaching children how to guess the teacher's password rather than teaching them how to think. With this in mind, I think humanity faces a use it or lose it scenario with regards to our brains. Due to a confluence of factors, for example technology, welfare, and entertainment, humans do not need to use their brains as much as they did in the past. I do not wish to believe this, and I feel I may have a misunderstanding of evolution in this case, so please, .<|CONCLUSION|>
