<|TOPIC|>Does Hell Exist?<|ARGUMENT|>The resurrected who receive terrestrial glory or the glory of the moon do not reside with Heavenly Father, but none-the-less are willing to submit to and live by some of His light like the light of the Sun reflecting off the Moon.<|ASPECTS|>terrestrial glory, glory, father<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>With new technologies such as CRISPR that can be used for gene editing, we are getting closer to ending many heritable conditions that make life difficult for many people. However, I have stumbled upon many people who consider having a disability i.e. blindness, deafness to be “normal” in the sense that they don’t see it as an impediment to life. While I’m very happy that we live in a day and age where having a disability does not stop you from achieving your goals in life, we have to remind ourselves that modern life is not the natural way for humans. We evolved to live in the savannas of Africa and if a person, for example, was born blind they would have a much higher chance of dying compared to someone who wasn’t. Let’s take it in a modern setting if two people were lost in the wilderness, the person with a heritable condition that made them use a wheelchair would have a lower chance of surviving compared to a person who could walk. Considering a less serious situation, imagine never hearing Mozart’s symphonies or never seeing Van Gogh’s artwork. People would be deprived from these experiences if parents chose on purpose to prevent them from inheriting their condition. I’m not advocating for “eugenics” with gene editing. People with disabilities have an equal right to life as much as someone who doesn’t. I fully advocate research into technology to help people with disabilities live a better life. It would just be better if the problem could be solved from the get go. In conclusion, if a parent has the ability to prevent such a condition from being inherited by their child, they have a moral responsibility to do it.<|ASPECTS|>heritable condition, serious situation, chance of surviving, condition, chance, better life, modern life, goals, dying, heritable conditions, research into technology, disability, natural way, normal, gene editing, deprived, equal right to life, impediment to life, disabilities, experiences, less, higher, problem could, solved, life difficult, eugenics, lower, deafness, moral responsibility, wilderness<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Should You Confess to Cheating After a One Night Stand?<|ARGUMENT|>Even if not backed up by data, this perception is wide-spread and thus relevant. In 2001, two thirds of Americans believed that at half or more of all married men have had an affair.<|ASPECTS|>wide-spread, men, relevant<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I think Jimmy Kimmel's segments where he has parents tell kids they've eaten all their halloween candy or when he has parents give them a shitty Christmas gift is wrong. Sam Harris wrote up a pretty good piece about it, which you can find here. The children's reaction to their parents' prank makes them seem they are pretty distressed about this, and it seems cruel. .<|ASPECTS|>distressed, children, gift, halloween candy, reaction, cruel, shitty<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I'm not watching listening to any matches. I made the decision for several reasons. Illegal russian annexation of Crimea. Anti LGBT laws in Russia. Russian history of corruption in sport generally as well as possibly the selection of Russia to host the world cup. In all honesty I'm not usually a fan of football anyway so this boycott was not difficult, however, when I made the choice before the competition began I had little belief that my home nation would could make it to the final. Now that there's a real chance for England to win, should I change my view? <|ASPECTS|>illegal russian annexation of crimea, corruption, anti lgbt laws, chance, win, fan<|CONCLUSION|>
