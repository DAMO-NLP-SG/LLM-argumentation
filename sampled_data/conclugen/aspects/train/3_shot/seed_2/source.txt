<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I think Jimmy Kimmel's segments where he has parents tell kids they've eaten all their halloween candy or when he has parents give them a shitty Christmas gift is wrong. Sam Harris wrote up a pretty good piece about it, which you can find here. The children's reaction to their parents' prank makes them seem they are pretty distressed about this, and it seems cruel. .<|ASPECTS|>distressed, children, gift, halloween candy, reaction, cruel, shitty<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I'm not watching listening to any matches. I made the decision for several reasons. Illegal russian annexation of Crimea. Anti LGBT laws in Russia. Russian history of corruption in sport generally as well as possibly the selection of Russia to host the world cup. In all honesty I'm not usually a fan of football anyway so this boycott was not difficult, however, when I made the choice before the competition began I had little belief that my home nation would could make it to the final. Now that there's a real chance for England to win, should I change my view? <|ASPECTS|>illegal russian annexation of crimea, corruption, anti lgbt laws, chance, win, fan<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Does Hell Exist?<|ARGUMENT|>The resurrected who receive terrestrial glory or the glory of the moon do not reside with Heavenly Father, but none-the-less are willing to submit to and live by some of His light like the light of the Sun reflecting off the Moon.<|ASPECTS|>terrestrial glory, glory, father<|CONCLUSION|>
