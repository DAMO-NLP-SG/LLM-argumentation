<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>With mobility being easier than ever, lots of people find themselves growing up in multicultural families. A child born and raised in Canada can have parents from Italy and New Zealand. That child will have a unique experience growing up in a blend of cultures from all of these places. According to my view, this child is Canadian. Saying this isn't meant to dismiss their experience of Italian and New Zealand culture through their family. Each person's cultural experience is unique – your family circumstances, your friends' and even the town and neighbourhood you grew up in, matter. But if you've never lived in Poland, can you really call yourself Polish? Note of clarification. My view does not concern the use of e.g. Irish as a shorthand for Irish American, which sounds like a word omission when it's obvious to all Americans involved. It concerns e.g. Irish Americans who tell people from Ireland I'm Irish, too. There are people who's family immigrated multiple generations ago who still identify from their country of origin, yet don't speak the language well if at all . My view is that they are wrong to identify with the people of a country they've never been in. I don't like my view as I don't like telling people what they can and can't be. If someone lived in country Y all their life and say they identify as from country X, it might mean they don't feel like they belong in Y. I don't want to kick them when they're down. But I can't help but cringe inside.<|ASPECTS|>, parents, cultural experience, multicultural families, view, blend, family circumstances, belong, irish, cringe, family immigrated, unique experience, child, people, polish, irish americans, kick, telling people, mobility, canadian, cultures, italian and new, word omission, identify, culture, use, wrong to identify<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I'm not watching listening to any matches. I made the decision for several reasons. Illegal russian annexation of Crimea. Anti LGBT laws in Russia. Russian history of corruption in sport generally as well as possibly the selection of Russia to host the world cup. In all honesty I'm not usually a fan of football anyway so this boycott was not difficult, however, when I made the choice before the competition began I had little belief that my home nation would could make it to the final. Now that there's a real chance for England to win, should I change my view? <|ASPECTS|>illegal russian annexation of crimea, corruption, anti lgbt laws, chance, win, fan<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I think Jimmy Kimmel's segments where he has parents tell kids they've eaten all their halloween candy or when he has parents give them a shitty Christmas gift is wrong. Sam Harris wrote up a pretty good piece about it, which you can find here. The children's reaction to their parents' prank makes them seem they are pretty distressed about this, and it seems cruel. .<|ASPECTS|>distressed, children, gift, halloween candy, reaction, cruel, shitty<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>When people tell me that if I want things to change I should vote I roll my eyes so hard that it hurts. Modern federal governments everywhere have been infected by plutocracy. They need to be restructured, and people need more control over their individual municipalities. The bigger a government is, the easier it is to corrupt. Municipal governments should be radically different from one another to accommodate how radically different we all are. Dont want gays to get married? Move to a town or part of a city where they cant, and where, because of this, no gays reside. We should embrace our differences rather than pretend we dont all hate each other.<|ASPECTS|>change, easier, corrupt, hurts, radically, infected, hate each, municipalities, gays reside, control, different, gays, governments, get married, radically different, restructured, embrace, differences, plutocracy<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Most ideas come from religion, which I don't believe in because of many reasons and I don't think those reasons are important to the view I'm trying to change I need to be convinced of an afterlife, not a particular religion . There has been no proof to tell us otherwise. People claim there are ghosts, except that no ghost has ever come forward for the whole world to see. People say there are 'spirits' again, same problem. People say there are 'signs' left by their loved ones, but people find those to make themselves feel better.<|ASPECTS|>ghost, feel better, afterlife, religion, left, proof, ghosts, problem<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>With new technologies such as CRISPR that can be used for gene editing, we are getting closer to ending many heritable conditions that make life difficult for many people. However, I have stumbled upon many people who consider having a disability i.e. blindness, deafness to be “normal” in the sense that they don’t see it as an impediment to life. While I’m very happy that we live in a day and age where having a disability does not stop you from achieving your goals in life, we have to remind ourselves that modern life is not the natural way for humans. We evolved to live in the savannas of Africa and if a person, for example, was born blind they would have a much higher chance of dying compared to someone who wasn’t. Let’s take it in a modern setting if two people were lost in the wilderness, the person with a heritable condition that made them use a wheelchair would have a lower chance of surviving compared to a person who could walk. Considering a less serious situation, imagine never hearing Mozart’s symphonies or never seeing Van Gogh’s artwork. People would be deprived from these experiences if parents chose on purpose to prevent them from inheriting their condition. I’m not advocating for “eugenics” with gene editing. People with disabilities have an equal right to life as much as someone who doesn’t. I fully advocate research into technology to help people with disabilities live a better life. It would just be better if the problem could be solved from the get go. In conclusion, if a parent has the ability to prevent such a condition from being inherited by their child, they have a moral responsibility to do it.<|ASPECTS|>heritable condition, serious situation, chance of surviving, condition, chance, better life, modern life, goals, dying, heritable conditions, research into technology, disability, natural way, normal, gene editing, deprived, equal right to life, impediment to life, disabilities, experiences, less, higher, problem could, solved, life difficult, eugenics, lower, deafness, moral responsibility, wilderness<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>the ICC is not an effective deterrent<|ARGUMENT|>The ICC’s investigative and prosecutorial powers are endorsed by 122 States Parties to the Rome Statute. This broad reach and agreement not only provides a strong disincentive for individuals and groups who would attempt to evade prosecution, but also has the effect of deterring states that might otherwise ignore the Court’s authority. Furthermore, even non-member states have recognised the importance of co-operating with the Court’s investigations. In 2013, one of the most wanted war criminals, Bosco Ntaganda was forced to surrender to the ICC while hiding in Rwanda. Though a non-member state, “Rwanda's aid-dependent economy was damaged by the allegations of links to Mr Ntaganda's rebels.”1 1 The Economist<|ASPECTS|>war criminals, co-operating, surrender, aid-dependent economy, deterring states, powers, investigative, disincentive, evade prosecution<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Should You Confess to Cheating After a One Night Stand?<|ARGUMENT|>Even if not backed up by data, this perception is wide-spread and thus relevant.
