<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I really want to believe that there is a god, and that I won't fade away into oblivion when I die. But I feel like I would be lying to myself if I starting following a religion. When people have dreams in their sleep where they talk to their dead loved ones, it's obvious that it's all just coming from their own brain. When people see heaven as they die, it's because more oxygen has been flooding to their brain causing them to hallucinate. As science and technology has advanced over hundreds of years, we are drifting further and further away from the idea of a god or an afterlife. I have a friend who is an A student and quite intelligent, and he is a strong Catholic. I also have another friend who is a vocal atheist, but he is a complete tool and extremely gullible. He was once told that a guy got suspended from school for not doing his maths homework, and he immediately believed. So how can somebody abandon their religious beliefs but also be so stupid? How can some people who are very intelligent also believe in God? Maybe atheists are just cynics who are over simplifying things. What if I am actually below average intelligence and I just can't see things the way religious people do? If I look at a religious person and I think that they are delusional, what makes me any different? What if I'm the delusional one? I know reddit is largely atheistic, so I have probably come to the wrong place to change my views of religion. But what the heck it's worth getting some other opinions anyway.<|ASPECTS|>, afterlife, god, fade, views of religion, average, intelligence, brain, simplifying things, lying, following, opinions, complete tool, people, oxygen, religious person, delusional, oblivion, atheists, maths homework, believe, vocal atheist, cynics, religious beliefs, dreams, intelligent, gullible, stupid, atheistic, hallucinate, heaven, strong catholic, religion, suspended from school, abandon<|CONCLUSION|>
