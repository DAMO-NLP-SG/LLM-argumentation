<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>First of all, regarding the consent issue, Facebook's data policy states that, if you share data with a friend, then that friend can re share that data with third party apps, and according to Facebook's Platform Policy, apps can Only use friend data including friends list in the person’s experience in your app. This, I believe, is a reasonable policy. If your friend shares some data with someone, it would be completely reasonable for you to feed that data into say an app that determines the diversity of your friends group. At the same time, however, this policy protects your friends' privacy by disallowing the use of their data beyond your experience with the app. Secondly, Facebook did not sell CA people's data. CA hired Professor Aleksandr Kogan to serve as a front, pretending to be making a personality prediction app for research purposes. They then used that app to harvest friend data in volation of platform policy. In other words, CA obtained the data by defrauding Facebook. When Facebook found out in 2016, they performed their due diligence in protecting their data. They demanded that CA and Kogan delete the data, and CA certified meaning it's perjury if they lie that they deleted said data. So in short Users consented to the sharing of their data on Facebook, and the policy the consented to was reasonable. Facebook did not sell CA user data. CA acquired the data through fraud and perjury. Facebook performed their due diligence in protecting user data when they discovered the fraud. <|TARGETS|>If your friend shares some data with someone, Aleksandr Kogan, the sharing of their data on Facebook, Facebook 's data policy, When Facebook found out in 2016, disallowing the use of their data beyond your experience with the app<|CONCLUSION|>
