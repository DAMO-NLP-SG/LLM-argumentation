<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I think that, despite how annoying he is, in the context of the theory Jar Jar’s existence isn't so pointless which puts a little more depth into the prequels. Also, I get that this is a theory, but it's likely it was never confirmed as canon because of how negatively he was received as a character in general. Without this theory Jar Jar is a pretty arbitrary main character, unless being there just for the laughs counts as good enough, but if you take it to be true then it recontextualizes his whole storyline. At first Yoda was a seemingly weird out of place character, but his back story proved that he was super important for the plot. You can shit on George Lucas for cheapening the prequels with unnecessary elements, but the Jar Jar sith theory could be entirely possible considering George Lucas had previously proved that he could introduce characters but not reveal their importance until later. It also helps to explain his behavior and why the Jedi somehow allowed him to have a significant role despite his appearance as a fool his Sith abilities allowed him to achieve that manipulation<|TARGETS|>the theory Jar Jar ’s existence, this theory Jar Jar, the Jar Jar sith theory, Yoda, to explain his behavior and why the Jedi somehow allowed him to have a significant role despite his appearance as a fool his Sith abilities allowed him to achieve that manipulation, cheapening the prequels with unnecessary elements<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I see many people give their opinions on economic and scientific issues often on the opposite sides of the economic or scientific consensus and I feel they have not earned the right to an opinion on the matter. Many of them have spent maybe dozens dozens of hours researching why, for example, climate change is false while probably only reading articles that agreed with their previously established beliefs , and they now consider their opinion equivalent to tens of thousands of scientists across the world who have PhDs and have spent decades researching the topic and who also agree that climate change is man made with a 97 consensus. How anyone could choose the minority opinion over the majority opinion on something that they know almost nothing about is so incredibly arrogant to me that I cannot fathom how they think that they have the expertise to even do so. I see this on so many topics, and it drives me crazy. Climate change, minimum wage, efficacy of the bailout, vaccinations autism, etc The worst part is many of the people who I know with such claims are highly educated, and would be upset in an instant if some guy who works at a grocery store with a highschool education told them that he is as much of an expert in their field as them. Yet, they are doing the same thing. You don't have to take an expert's words as dogma, but you also should never think that you can pick the small minority over the large majority when you have no expertise in the subject. A non expert who picks the small minority over the majority is incredibly arrogant. Change my view.<|TARGETS|>How anyone could choose the minority opinion over the majority opinion on something that they know almost nothing about is so incredibly arrogant to me that I cannot fathom how they think that they have the expertise to even do so ., Climate change, the small minority over the large majority when you have no expertise in the subject ., reading articles that agreed with their previously established beliefs and they now consider their opinion equivalent to tens of thousands of scientists across the world who have PhDs and have spent decades researching the topic and who also agree that climate change, if some guy who works at a grocery store with a highschool education, many people give their opinions on economic and scientific issues often on the opposite sides of the economic or scientific consensus and I feel they have not earned the right to an opinion on the matter .<|CONCLUSION|>
