<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>The US military is taking justice into its own hands by conducting extrajudicial killings of terrorists. Yes they have committed horrendous crimes against the United States and killed scores of innocent people but they deserve to be given justice in US Courts or tried in their own countries just like anyone else. The US Military cannot serve as judge, jury and executioner. It is the right way to send a message about the world that the United States won't stoop down to vigilantism to right wrongs committed against us. With religion motivating these terrorists the death of others doesn't scare them, they become martyrs. The increased use of drones for these operations has only made the situation worst by killing innocent civilians and children in the crossfire and it serves only to enrage terrorists more take what happened in the recent Peshawar attack Now Please try to .<|TARGETS|>The US Military, to send a message about the world that the United States wo n't stoop down to vigilantism to right wrongs committed against us ., With religion motivating these terrorists the death of others, The US military, The increased use of drones for these operations, to be given justice in US Courts or tried in their own countries just like anyone else .<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>A lot of people seem to think that a country encouraging people to follow it's own laws is morally wrong They are encouraging them to leave, not seeking for them to be arrested and hoarded which they could if they felt the need to Although go home sounds insensitive I feel that is the most direct way of addressing illegal immigrants short of just arresting them all and deporting them. Just because it isn't aimed exclusively at white people and may be geared towards Foreigners , doesn't mean they're out to get them. People who immigrate have faced harder things in life than a Bully campaign, and are probably more adept to being able to handle situations like this. People in 1^st World Countries take offence to many things, even stuff that doesn't effect them.

<|TOPIC|>United Nations: A Failure?<|ARGUMENT|>There are also institutional problems associated with the General Assembly and the Security Council, whereby GA resolutions with widespread support can be stymied by a single veto from one of the Permanent 5.

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I believe that there is pretty much no reason to use chalkboards over whiteboards. Reason 1 Chalk sucks. To quote anakin skywalker, it's coarse, it's rough, and it gets everywhere chalk dust, that is. No one likes getting a bunch of chalk on their hands and shirt, but that's what happens when you use chalk. Whiteboard markers don't have this problem. Reason 2 chalkboards suck First off there's always the looming threat of someone scraping their nails down a chalkboard and destroying your nerves. Also to erase stuff you have to use a dusty eraser which doesn't even erase completely and puts even more dust into the air. Markers can generally be easily erased with just a finger or a paper towel and with no mess.
