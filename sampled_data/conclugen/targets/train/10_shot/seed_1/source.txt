<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I think that, despite how annoying he is, in the context of the theory Jar Jar’s existence isn't so pointless which puts a little more depth into the prequels. Also, I get that this is a theory, but it's likely it was never confirmed as canon because of how negatively he was received as a character in general. Without this theory Jar Jar is a pretty arbitrary main character, unless being there just for the laughs counts as good enough, but if you take it to be true then it recontextualizes his whole storyline. At first Yoda was a seemingly weird out of place character, but his back story proved that he was super important for the plot. You can shit on George Lucas for cheapening the prequels with unnecessary elements, but the Jar Jar sith theory could be entirely possible considering George Lucas had previously proved that he could introduce characters but not reveal their importance until later. It also helps to explain his behavior and why the Jedi somehow allowed him to have a significant role despite his appearance as a fool his Sith abilities allowed him to achieve that manipulation<|TARGETS|>the theory Jar Jar ’s existence, this theory Jar Jar, the Jar Jar sith theory, Yoda, to explain his behavior and why the Jedi somehow allowed him to have a significant role despite his appearance as a fool his Sith abilities allowed him to achieve that manipulation, cheapening the prequels with unnecessary elements<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was entirely removed. A good sniper has no real counter apart from another sniper, making them frustrating to play against. A majority of the other weapons have damage fall off to discourage long range play, further separating the sniper as a class. As far as I can tell, snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, which the spy already does and does in a more interesting to play as and against way. I can't see any way the sniper, sitting at the back of the map away from the action, adds to the game as a side note, I also think the removal of sniper would do nothing but good for the class diversity on pubs . Please, <|TARGETS|>snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, the removal of sniper, that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was entirely removed ., A good sniper, any way the sniper sitting at the back of the map away from the action<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>Terrorists should be subject to the Geneva Conventions<|ARGUMENT|>Terrorists are engaged in a war like any other: they unite as a political actor to undertake military action in favour of a specific cause. The fact that they do not represent one individual nation and that they are not at war with a specific list of states does not undermine this: Al Qaeda, for example, has clear goals including eliminating American influence within Muslim nations, destroying Israel and re-establishing the Caliphate Blanchard, 2007. The fact that we may not view these causes as worthy or legitimate is irrelevant: we do not assess the merits or legitimacy of a conflict between states before deciding whether to apply the Geneva Convention. It should therefore apply equally to soldiers and terrorists.<|TARGETS|>The fact that we may not view these causes as worthy or legitimate, The fact that they do not represent one individual nation and that they are not at war with a specific list of states<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I see many people give their opinions on economic and scientific issues often on the opposite sides of the economic or scientific consensus and I feel they have not earned the right to an opinion on the matter. Many of them have spent maybe dozens dozens of hours researching why, for example, climate change is false while probably only reading articles that agreed with their previously established beliefs , and they now consider their opinion equivalent to tens of thousands of scientists across the world who have PhDs and have spent decades researching the topic and who also agree that climate change is man made with a 97 consensus. How anyone could choose the minority opinion over the majority opinion on something that they know almost nothing about is so incredibly arrogant to me that I cannot fathom how they think that they have the expertise to even do so. I see this on so many topics, and it drives me crazy. Climate change, minimum wage, efficacy of the bailout, vaccinations autism, etc The worst part is many of the people who I know with such claims are highly educated, and would be upset in an instant if some guy who works at a grocery store with a highschool education told them that he is as much of an expert in their field as them. Yet, they are doing the same thing. You don't have to take an expert's words as dogma, but you also should never think that you can pick the small minority over the large majority when you have no expertise in the subject. A non expert who picks the small minority over the majority is incredibly arrogant. Change my view.<|TARGETS|>How anyone could choose the minority opinion over the majority opinion on something that they know almost nothing about is so incredibly arrogant to me that I cannot fathom how they think that they have the expertise to even do so ., Climate change, the small minority over the large majority when you have no expertise in the subject ., reading articles that agreed with their previously established beliefs and they now consider their opinion equivalent to tens of thousands of scientists across the world who have PhDs and have spent decades researching the topic and who also agree that climate change, if some guy who works at a grocery store with a highschool education, many people give their opinions on economic and scientific issues often on the opposite sides of the economic or scientific consensus and I feel they have not earned the right to an opinion on the matter .<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>I'm not advocating anything racist. I'm advocating regulations on reproduction depending on aptitude tests, physicals, medical history, etc. Inherent Human Rights I do not believe that people have the inherent right to reproduce. In fact, I find it to be morally offensive for someone to reproduce irresponsibly. To create life knowing that the person will most likely suffer from a crippling physical condition or something similar is immoral. Reductio ad Hitlerum A fallacy that consists of comparing something to Nazi Germany or the actions attitudes of Hitler or a similar person regime in order to discredit an argument. ^ I suspect this topic will come up on this thread. I don't mind people citing examples from Nazi Germany but you have to do more than just say, The Nazis did it, therefore it's bad. I don't believe that eugenics is inherently bad. It was widely accepted until the atrocities in the holocaust, but slippery slope does not invalidate its legitimacy. <|TARGETS|>it to be morally offensive for someone to reproduce irresponsibly ., advocating anything racist ., To create life knowing that the person will most likely suffer from a crippling physical condition or something similar, to do more than just say The Nazis, the inherent right to reproduce ., advocating regulations on reproduction<|CONCLUSION|>
