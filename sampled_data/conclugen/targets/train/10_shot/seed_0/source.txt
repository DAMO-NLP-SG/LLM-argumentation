<|TOPIC|>Will cryptocurrencies replace fiat currencies?<|ARGUMENT|>An asset is only valuable if other people are willing to trade it in return for goods, services, or other assets.

Gold is gold—anywhere you travel in the world, you can exchange gold for whatever the local currency is. The same will be said about cryptocurrencies, very soon.<|TARGETS|>An asset, convert it into cash on the spot and its value, Gold<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>Populist results, such as Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, are signs of a healthy democracy.<|ARGUMENT|>Many sources have reported that the Brexit campaign was founded on the basis of lies and deception. This was not an informed vote, but a maliciously misinformed vote. This is not what populism should be, as it does not allow people to demonstrate their sentiment on issues based on factual, accurate campaigns for each side of the vote.<|TARGETS|>the Brexit campaign, to demonstrate their sentiment on issues based on factual accurate campaigns for each side of the vote<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>First of all, regarding the consent issue, Facebook's data policy states that, if you share data with a friend, then that friend can re share that data with third party apps, and according to Facebook's Platform Policy, apps can Only use friend data including friends list in the person’s experience in your app. This, I believe, is a reasonable policy. If your friend shares some data with someone, it would be completely reasonable for you to feed that data into say an app that determines the diversity of your friends group. At the same time, however, this policy protects your friends' privacy by disallowing the use of their data beyond your experience with the app. Secondly, Facebook did not sell CA people's data. CA hired Professor Aleksandr Kogan to serve as a front, pretending to be making a personality prediction app for research purposes. They then used that app to harvest friend data in volation of platform policy. In other words, CA obtained the data by defrauding Facebook. When Facebook found out in 2016, they performed their due diligence in protecting their data. They demanded that CA and Kogan delete the data, and CA certified meaning it's perjury if they lie that they deleted said data. So in short Users consented to the sharing of their data on Facebook, and the policy the consented to was reasonable. Facebook did not sell CA user data. CA acquired the data through fraud and perjury. Facebook performed their due diligence in protecting user data when they discovered the fraud. <|TARGETS|>If your friend shares some data with someone, Aleksandr Kogan, the sharing of their data on Facebook, Facebook 's data policy, When Facebook found out in 2016, disallowing the use of their data beyond your experience with the app<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>Before I start, I do believe that it is the mother’s decision on whether or not she chooses to breastfeed her infant. Having said that, breastfeeding is the ultimate form of care and it should be more influenced in today’s society. To start, it is free, it contains infection fighting blood cells, important microorganisms, and antibodies. It contains the perfect amount of nutrients for the child, it reduces allergies and asthma, and it decreases the rate of obesity in the future. Many argue that their formula fed child has never had asthma compared to their friend’s breastfed kids who has asthma. However, anecdotal evidence is not necessarily representative of typical experience unlike statistical evidence. In a meta analysis, Ip and colleagues found a 1.7 fold risk of developing asthma among formula fed children with a positive family history of asthma or atopy and a 1.4 fold risk among those without a family history, compared with those who were breastfed for 3 months or more. Some may think this is small difference, but when it comes to the health of one’s newborn I would not take any chances. There may also be benefits to the mother. “We found in this study of over 1,600 women with breast cancer that those who previously breast fed had a 30 percent overall decreased risk of their breast cancer recurring, said study leader Marilyn Kwan, a research scientist at the Kaiser Permanente division of research in Oakland, Calif. In 2005, only 31.5 were exclusively breastfed at age 3 months, and just 11.9 were exclusively breastfed at age 6 months. Formula was created to give babies nutrients when their mothers passed away or were no longer able to feed their babies. Society has evolved and so has the effectiveness of formula, and mothers find artificially feeding their children normal. Back in the day this was not normal. Now woman are working long hours and are still expected to care for their children. There is also the option of pumping which allows mothers to return to work earlier. Yes I agree that formula feeding is the more convent and efficient method however, a small amount of breast feeding is better than none at all. Even a few days of breastfeeding has immense health benefits not to leave out the skin to skin contact that bonds the mother and child. “Being skin to skin with mother protects the newborn from the well documented negative effects of separation, supports optimal brain development and facilitates attachment, which promotes the infant's self regulation over time.” Lastly, breastfeeding in public tends to be a controversial topic as well. I do believe that if a bottle fed baby gets to have his or her dinner in public, than a breastfed baby should have the same rights. Have you ever seen a public restroom where you would like to feed your baby? People need to stop criticizing women for this. I think a nursing baby is easier to look and than a screaming hungry child. What are your thoughts? Stuebe, Alison. The Risks of Not Breastfeeding for Mothers and Infants.

<|TOPIC|>All Humans Should Be Vegan.<|ARGUMENT|>Early modern humans ate mostly mammoth, along with antelope, horses, and deer The meat we eat is different today, as some of these animals are extinct. To say we cannot and should not change does not make sense, as we had to evolve even our meat-eating tendencies to keep it in our nature.<|TARGETS|>To say we cannot and should not change, to evolve even our meat-eating tendencies to keep it in our nature .<|CONCLUSION|>
<|TOPIC|>NA<|ARGUMENT|>So if you have ever seen the show Avatar the Last Airbender you should know the main character is Aang a person who has control over the element of air and is the Avatar a human who has the ability to learn and master a four of the elements which are Water,Earth,Fire,and Air. One of the Avatars' ace in the holes is the ability called the Avatar State where Aang basically synchronizes with all the past Avatars to ever exist and then has near God like control over the elements becoming damn near unstoppable. Now the Day of Black Sun was a small invasion of the bad guy Fire Nation with the hopes of ending the war then and there since the Black Sun represents an eclipse a time where all fire benders lose the ability to fire bend. Long story short the invasion fails and it's because of Aang and his inability to truly want to win by killing.Aang could have teamed up with all the waterbenders and flooded the entire island drowning all fire nation soldiers and the Fire Lord main bad guy Aangs reluctance to ever consider killing since he was a monk put his entire group in danger and resulted in a massive failure. TLDR Aang had the power to win the war if he would have just drowned the island with the help of all the water benders but choosing not to put others in danger and in real life would have gotten some killed .<|TARGETS|>Long story short the invasion, TLDR Aang, the show Avatar the Last Airbender, Aang and his inability to truly want to win by killing.Aang could have teamed up with all the waterbenders and flooded the entire island drowning all fire nation soldiers and the Fire Lord main bad guy Aangs reluctance to ever consider killing since he was a monk put his entire group in danger<|CONCLUSION|>

<|TOPIC|>Is informed consent the determining factor of morality?<|ARGUMENT|>Applied across society, there is no choice one can make for which everyone affected both fully agrees and fully understands. If informed consent was a determining factor then there will never be a moral choice for a contentious issue. Take slavery as an obvious choice. The slavers will not consent to releasing their slaves. The slaves will not consent to bondage. If the standard is universal informed consent, there is no moral choice and yet clearly there is.<|TARGETS|>The slavers, Take slavery, If informed consent<|CONCLUSION|>
