I believe nature can adapt and survive climate change. Climate change has been doing good things in certain parts of the world Nature can clean and handle a lot of issues people are worried about I'm speaking in the broad sense. I do have a problem with pollution in the case of contaminating people's drinking water like is done with fracking. What I'm not worried about is CO2 pollution caused by cows, cars and generating power. I think nature can easily adapt. In order to change my view, you'd have to demonstrate nature completely failing at adapting to man caused problems.

It is unreasonable for us to expect to understand God's purposes as we have tiny, finite minds compared to the infinite mind of God,therefore it is unreasonable to precondition our belief in God upon our first understanding God's purposes.
Emptiness is a core value in Buddhism. E.g. Nagarjuna the main Buddhist philosopher says that phenomena don't have an essence, everything we thought about the world and about us isn't based in a stable and immutable reality every compound is impermanent. So Mahayana Buddhism does not seek to be definitive, nor does it aspire to permanence, these features undermine the claim that it is a religion.
In confined animal feeding operations CAFOs pigs have their tails cut off, chickens have their toenails and beaks clipped off, and cows have their horns removed and tails cut off with no painkillers.
