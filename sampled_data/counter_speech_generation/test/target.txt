In order to consider, whether nationalism does more harm than good, you must consider the counterfactual: what would have been here had we not had nationalism? We think that, this debate is inherently comparative, in that we think, human beings have an inherent need and desire to group around things that unite them and join them together. This is why in the entire history of mankind, man has always grouped together over certain ideologies, aspects, or whatever it is. Historically, it has taken the form of religion, of monarchism, and of nationalism. Of these alternatives, we think nationalism is by far the best, and we think these alternatives are, in fact, the other options for how life may be. Let's get into rebuttal first. So first, tim says nationalism is exclusionary to other groups, he is correct about that, and then he takes it from that, and says that's why there's xenophobia, that is what he is incorrect about. Xenophobia existed far before nationalism. Religions fought amongst themselves for millennia, so did monarchies who went to war over crown crown and queen, for example. We don't think nationalism caused that. In fact, we think since the rise of nationalism, national wars have gone drastically down. Secondly, he says: minority groups within society feel exclusion, excluded. Again, let's look comparatively. We think a jew, in a christian society, is inherently excluded from that society. We think, an israeli in a american society, can take upon himself aspects of american nationalism, without giving up his religious identity, and thereby allow him to participate in society, more than other groupings would. Lastly, he says: it allows for corrupt leaders. We accept this, it's true. We think it's less so than the alternatives, that are based on a deity. Let's take a look into that. Why is nationalism better? Two reasons: one, based on leaders, second, based on geographic inclusion. First, let's talk about leaders. We think what makes nationalism unique, is that it puts the people in the middle. The comparative of nationalism is various forms of identity, that all include one central leader, be it god, be it chief rabbi, be it a king or a queen. We think that is particularly dangerous, because it allows for that corrupt power, in a significantly more powerful way, than any form of identity based on the nation as a whole. At the point, at which even the leader can be seen to be harming the nation, we think, that nationalism allows groups to protect themselves from corrupt leaders. It is true, that in instances, it also allows them to fall to corrupt leaders, but historically, we think you have far more corrupt leaders under alternative ways of grouping society. So, we think nationalism is better based on the leaders. Let's talk about geographic inclusion. At the point, at which you have two " otherize " some group, because in order to unite yourself with some people, it inherently necessitates creating some form of enemy, and this has been true all throughout history. We think, the best way of doing that, is uniting yourself around the group, based on where you are geographically located. We think that's better, because it's much more difficult to start wars with people who are far away from you. We think that's better, because it's much more difficult to have local tensions, if all of your enemies are far away from you. We think it's better, because all of the reasons, for which humans tend to strive to be in groups, mean that they gain more from these groups, when they are surrounded by these groups. So, nationalism is the best form of grouping together, and grouping together is inherent to human nature. For these reasons, we think nationalism has done far more good than harm.
What we hear from side government is more or less that due to the effects of the aging of the population, raising the retirement age is necessary in order to sustain the social security benefits system. Because life expectancy has gone up, they tell us, people will still be able to enjoy their retirement even if we were to raise the retirement age. But the first major problem with their with the model that they're suggesting is that they want to calculate the age of retirement like according to the average life expectancy. The thing is average is a tricky thing. While it is true that the average life expectancy has gone up, this doesn't mean that it has gone up equally for everybody. It's an average so, in fact, the data shows that while for the upper class life expectancy has indeed gone up significantly during the last decades, for the lower class it has barely budged. So, it makes sense that, on average, life expectancy has gone up, but this also means that if we set the age of retirement according to the average life expectancy, this will create a very serious discrimination between different classes in society, and it's going to be the lower class that is going to suffer a great deal, because now they they'll be forced to work a lot more, and rest a lot less. So, now you're probably asking yourselves, " okay, we get it, but the population is still aging, so what can we do about the sustainability problem that side government talks about? " Well, the truth, in fact, is that although aging is a thing and definitely something that's going on, it's not really that big of a threat to the sustainability of like the entire retirement program. How come? Simple. Because people and governments are also, with time, becoming richer. Economies are advancing and doing better like as the years go by, and this happens thanks to advancements in knowledge and technology that allow each worker to be much more productive during the years that he is working or, in other words, the total factor productivity is constantly rising. And this is something that's true cross classes: true for the upper class and it's true for the lower class. So this means that instead of forcing everyone to work a lot more for many more years, we can quite simply just raise a little bit the rate of the premiums and solve the sustainability problem. So eventually, we at opposition think that be capitalistic world has made people, turned people, into labor machines, and that the fact that people spend forty to fifty years of their lives working five to six days a week is already more than enough. There is more to this life than just work. We think that once you have grandchildren, we can say that regardless of how many years you still have left, you have already contributed enough to society, and you deserve to use the years that you still have in order to rest and to travel the world and to spend time with your family. For all of these reasons, we are proud to oppose.
Don't abolish the two party system. Two main arguments: first, on preventing a split of the votes. With a two party system individuals choose the party that meets their preferences on aggregate. This vastly prevents people having to choose between their personal interests when choosing a party because aside from a weird in between demographic that might be both religious and socially liberal or like economically liberal, there's very few situations in which people don't fit into the general guidelines outlined by republican versus democrat. With many parties you'll often have people who generally agree politically choosing different parties because they're prioritizing specifically different interests within that. So two people might all agree on being economically and socially liberal and simultaneously they might believe in like religious freedom but these kinds of interest now all have to be prioritized in different ways because they can choose between parties that specifically are interested in that one thing. Believing in protecting the environment marginally more than believing in prioritizing putting money into welfare in the current system just means you vote democrat either way. But in james' world it means that these two people would vote for two different parties on the basis of priorities even when the beliefs of both are very similar. This is bad because it means that you don't get a good idea of where the overall soup social beliefs of society lie because you're just getting votes from these candidates who prioritize specific issues. It's also bad because it means that if one party can cross that divide and get everyone behind it who would usually vote for these marginally different candidates, they can steamroll everyone else just because the rest aren't being cohesive enough. So if you have a generically republican candidate who might be just like more like cover more ground than a bunch of other candidates that are marginally different but all of the like stereotypically democratic ideas are spread across many many different candidates, then even though there might be on net more democratically leaning individuals, the republican is still going to win just because he was able to campaign enough to get people to come across that divide. This still occurs even with james specific iteration of the model because just about who ranks highest and if you can get enough people to rank one as the highest. He's worried about minority viewpoints. Like we just don't think that minority viewpoints get protected well on either side of the house because it's pretty much impossible for a minority group to get one of their candidates through without a critical mass of support. So on james side their candidates aren't going to come through either way because you'd still need enough people to rank them at the top in order to even get them selected. At least on our side of the house there's some chance that within the party you're likely to have minority people who are serving in like different positions even if they're not the people who are running for like president or running for the main seat in congress. Like you'll still have them at lower levels of the democratic party. Our second argument is about preventing an increase in gridlock. We're talking about the country that already struggles with getting things through with two parties. It's going to be infinitely more with infinitely worse when you add more parties. Like you're literally just not going to be able to get policies through which we think is infinitely worse than any kind of impact that james might have to like general democracy just because it means that you're not going to be able to accomplish what democracy is actually meant to do which is impact based actually giving people policies that would help them in their daily lives. Like at the end of the day, people rely on their government to do governance. So if we show you that having a modestly more democratic system interferes with that, we still win the round. Proud to oppose.
Tim ends his speech by saying global warming is a major thing that must be dealt with immediately. We would note that the motion would have him defend that global warming is a threat. We too believe global warming should be dealt with immediately. But much like a small puppy urinating inside your house, while it ought to be dealt with, it ought not be seen as a threat because of the success you are likely to have in dealing with it. Two arguments on this side of the house as to what is likely to happen with global warming. One, we'll fix it. Two, we'll hit the reset button. Before that a few points of rebuttal mostly pertaining to how we might fix particular aspects. So one, tim says seaside areas go under water. Look, not to be blunt, but we're not missing space. Given that this is happening quite slowly it seems we can predict it happening. We can catch it in time and people living by the sea side can move inwards. We would note that seaside areas are often the most populated just because they're pretty and inland we're not missing space at all whatsoever. That's clearly not a big threat. Secondly, he says there's a loss of history when that happens. We ask why. What exactly is it that is of historic value but cannot be carried out? Even if you take the most massive land mine known, like the egyptian pyramids or something, still modern technology can take that apart, move it, and put it back together. We don't know what history it is tim thinks is going to be lost. Then he says, how are we going to grow food? Look, scientists are about a year away from making actual meat in a laboratory. We don't think that growing wheat indoors is going to be the problem, greenhouses already exist. We think it's exceptionally likely that solutions already exist for this and if they don't will easily be found for production of foods disregarding weather patterns. Lastly, he went on he goes on some sort of tangent regarding agro firms or something or other whatever it is that causes global warming. We would know that this is irrelevant to the debate of whether or not global warming is a threat. So first, let's talk about fix. Two forms of fix: the good form of fix is we're going to fix actual global warming. That means we find some sort of way to take COTwo emissions for example out of the atmosphere and return them into HTwo_o. , return them into oxygen, whatever it is. We would note that massive scientific advancement already exists in this field and we think it is likely to succeed. Given that we think are likely to succeed, we wouldn't categorize global warming as a threat. There was a time a long time ago when people used horses instead of cars and at some point the streets of london started flooding with horse feces and they were sure this is a massive threat until they figured out they can simply repurpose all these feces as fertilizer. The point of the story being human ingenuity knows no bounds. We think we are highly likely to find a solution for this problem as well. Secondly, even if we don't fix the problem in the grand scale, we think it's quite easy to fix the various aspects of problematic areas that global warming causes. So like we already talked about with food, like we already talked about with moving inwards, we think human ingenuity, at the very least, is likely to be able to find solutions for the various damages global warming will cause which we again means it's not a threat. Lastly, what happens if all else fails? We say it's similar to hitting the reset button. Global warming does, in a cyclical way, cure itself. So while there is harm to people who exist today, in a long term, a grand scheme of things, you're looking more like somebody hitting restart on the computer as opposed to the end of times, which once again, would not be considered a threat in the grand scheme of things. For all these reasons, please oppose.
Don't protect the antarctic continent. Two main arguments: first, on avoiding conflict. This is an area that a lot of countries are constantly fighting over, and james is wrong about the status quo situation of antarctica. We already have a semblance of a treaty, so this is really just a debate about whether we should protect it even more, presumably according to the model that james gave. In the status quo, we've broken in, albeit uneasy, peaceful situation in which the arctic is claimed by certain countries over certain pieces, and it is majority no drill and mostly retained for the use of scientific research. This is remarkably close to what james is proposing when he says that: look, we're just going to have a massive international space, like section, in which, presumably, research can still occur. So what you have to ask yourself is: is it worth upending all of the current alliances, treaties, and agreements in order to try and remold into something that is only marginally harsher and marginally better than what we have in the status quo? We think, generally, the status quo is a good state of affairs, and moving to protect the arctic more is only going to stir up more drama. Doing what james said and making it into a reservation is just going to open up new discussion about who is funding it, controlling it, maintaining it, and what kind of actions are taking place there, as well as accusations of individuals not carrying their weight or lying about what's happening. We don't think it's worth restarting unless james can show you that there's something really, really bad about the current system, which he doesn't even start to do because he misunderstands the current system entirely. James asserts that the value of virgin land is very high, but this is only because of the potential it holds for capital. There is nothing inherent to untouched land that makes it so good as long as we're able to maintain the animal life that already lives there, which we've seen is possible with even when drilling or even when other exploitation is happening. The only time we've really seen it be an issue is when we're actually felling the environment around it, like cutting down trees in the rainforest and similar objects, which doesn't happen here. Moreover, james keeps saying we're saving it for posterity, but posterity is just going to exploit it the same way we want to. So we're unclear on what the harm in doing it earlier rather than later is. Our second argument is about the misdirection of environmentalist efforts. We should put the resources we use in defending the arctic toward stopping global warming more broadly. First, because this is likely to be good for the arctic. It stops the polar ice caps from melting but, also, because it's going to do a lot more good for the entirety of the world if we can stop the impacts of global warming than if we just help protect the arctic. This is because global warming impacts the standards of living of almost every person on earth, as well as brings it with it the potential for complete extermination. While the arctic might be interesting and full of nature, it doesn't have any existential ties to anything besides itself. We've we have to recognize that the political capital for environmentalist efforts comes from the same pot. Similar people want to protect the arctic as want to deal with global warming, and when we're pushing for some action to occur, those people have to choose where they think there energy would be used most effectively. So we think that if we put all of this energy behind saving the arctic, that leaves very little to stimulate and put energy in for something like fighting global warming more generally, especially since those same people also have to convince the same politicians, who will feel like they've already given ground and like given more than enough when they protect the arctic, so they're going to be unwilling to give in on another issue like other global warming policy. This weighs directly against james' argument about urgency, because nothing is more urgent than dealing with global warming, given that we care about the preservation of human race more than we care about the arctic. So, we just think this automatically wins the round because even if saving the arctic is urgent, what we are saving on the arctic is less important than what would be saving otherwise. Proud to oppose.
We should not introduce goal-line technology. We think it's important to note at the very start of this debate that whether or not goal-line technology is introduced, this is likely to be a fairly marginal thing within the game of soccer. For the vast majority of goals that are scored or not scored it is incredibly clear whether or not the bull the ball made it past the broke the field of play within the goal. So we think that in almost all situations goal-line technology is not going to be used but we think that there are benefits to the game in not having it present at all. The first argument that the government side makes is that this is important for the spirit of game and that fairness is necessary to maximize the game but as I just stated, this is largely not an issue because most goals are clear cut. If you look at almost almost every soccer game you watch is not going to have an instance in which any sort of review or replay is necessary because most of the time either the goalie saves the ball or the ball is able to make it into the goal. It's just it's an incredibly obvious thing because these plays happen so fast, because people are so precise in scoring their goals. So we just don't think that people in the status quo feel this lack of fairness because of a lack of goal-line technology. The next argument they make though is that this is necessary for fans to have faith in the game. So first see above about why this is not an issue in the status quo. The second thing though is that if people don't have faith in the referees, for example, and if refs are actually corrupt, there's just a number of other ways for them to be successful in being corrupt that have nothing to do with goal-line technology. It's things like calling it off side when right before a goal is about to be scored when it wasn't really off side. It's like giving a red card or a yellow card erroneously on a questionable play and these are things that technology is not going to do a sufficient job of reviewing or of checking. But one thing that we actually think is a positive of referees occasionally messing up, is that fans really rally around those types of things and you form stronger fan communities. While maybe it may cost your favorite team a game or two in the standings, in the long run having memories to look back on as a fan base, things that bring people together are incredibly important. Look at a game look at a team like the cubs in baseball for example, they have one of the strongest fan bases in baseball not because their team is immensely successful but rather because they have been so unsuccessful for so long and they can point to so many moments in their history where they feel like they were screwed over, where they feel like the outcome wasn't fair and they rally around those memories and it creates a stronger fan base which is ultimately good for the teams, it's good for the game, it brings in more revenue, and it's better for the fans. The third argument they make under this is that the speed of the game is better. We think that it's actually better on our side because you're just less likely to have reviews which means the game pace continues to go on and that people don't have to pause to check in these kind of marginal cases. The second argument they make is that this is better for the refs and that goal-line technology doesn't make refs obsolete but it helps in gray areas. The first argument we would say is that we think that once you start making this transition into technological refereeing, this creates a slippery slope in which refs start to get phased out in other ways. If you accept goal-line technology then maybe you accept technology that automatically reviews offside calls or maybe you accept technology through things like AI and machine learning that can tell whether or not a slide was deserving of a red card or not and we think it's unfair to the refs to start putting them in that position. But it also put it also puts past calls into judgment because instituting this says there's a problem in the status quo that needs to be fixed which starts to create an entire referendum on the history of the game which we think is problematic. They say good reps have evidence and integrity to show when a play is close but again we don't think this is an issue of the status quo. Finally, they say this is a check on bad refs the argument we made already in response to this. For these reasons, we should not introduce goal-line technology.
Don't adopt the metric system. First we disagree with danny. We think that this is actually an incredibly difficult transition. The only thing he considers is how it's being it's easy to transition to mentally, something we're going to question on our first independent point. But he forgets that there are plenty of mechanistic reasons as to why the metric system implementation is actually really difficult. Like all the stuff that we'll have to reproduce and replace, the institutions of learning that will have to be fundamentally changed, and all of these kinds of things that both add up in terms of cost but also in terms of manpower and in terms of just like adding to that difficulty. So and I think this is a very problematic aspect of danny's speech. Even if he proves the metric system is intuitively better for any kind of reason, if you cannot prove that it is so much better, that it is worth overcoming these kinds of difficulties, we don't think he can win this round because at the end of the day we're okay with settling for something that might be less efficient or less intuitive given that people have clearly shown they are capable of absorbing and operating within it as long as it means we don't have to face those kinds of costs. Two main arguments, first on the unnecessary confusion. Technology can easily convert between the metric system and they can and the imperial system. And while it may have been true in the past that the imperial system was actively detrimental due to how often conversions were necessary, at this point we have enough technology and enough separation between spaces that the need for the metric system and those that need the imperial system that this is a non issue. Since it is so unnecessary we value the confusion it would create even more. This is the real matter reason it's not so easy to convert. People in science, engineering, other fields that have international collaboration and applications of measurements are already using the metric system in the status quo. And high schoolers who are taking those specialized classes are also learning the metric system. But for the average american who doesn't need this specialized information, switching to the metric system will disrupt a significant portion of their everyday life. Every application for everyday life that is currently using the english system will need to change from buying milk, gas, measuring the temperature, weighing something out, and these are all things that people have already created schemas and expectations for. There is no reason to just stabilize the american population this way given that we can already use the metric system when we need to. We agree intuitively it might be easier to learn the metric system because as danny says it goes by tens and hundreds. But we think that it's harder to learn once you've already learned the customary system. Moreover we don't think the customary system is that hard to memorize. People usually learn it early and are able to look things up that they use less often, but maybe if you're someone who really often works with temperature or really frequently works with gas measurements, those are things that are fairly ingrained within the customary system. So shifting thought would be problematic. Our second argument is about it being expensive. The second reason that it's really not an easy transition as danny claims you have to change the measurements on all packaged products whether it's food, housing lots, temperature, mileage and speed signs, vehicle production has to completely shift. Like this is literally millions and millions of dollars both in the public sector and also in the private sector that have to go into these kinds of shifts. The burden is also you also have to change all of the textbooks and current educational material. So this is also millions of dollars worth of changes, especially given the high price of textbooks and educational materials more broadly. And recognize the burden is likely to fall on individual schools and teachers given how hostile the current administration has been towards education spending and supporting our schools. This means that private schools and rich public schools will likely be able to make the shift, but poor public schools in areas are going to be stuck with the same materials as before which is doubly problematic because now you have a class striation in terms of what people are learning and how obsolete that knowledge is. Proud to oppose.
Don't ban foreign workers. Three main arguments, first on the benefit for the economy. Right off the bat I want to deal with james' argument about wage depression. We think that this is only an issue when the country didn't have good wage laws in the first place, which the majority of WLD's do because foreign workers are still governed by the law of the country they're in as long as they are there legally. So any kind of work protections whether it is a minimum wage, whether it is like the benefits that have to be offered, any kind of like union protections, all of those things still apply to foreign workers that are in the state legally. So if workers are depressing wages, this is just a reason people will be politically active to get a higher wage in that area because it shows not that those foreign workers are problematic but rather that the laws that are currently in place aren't over arching enough to protect the people who need protecting. Moreover we think the problem with james is that he makes this issue worse when you ban foreign workers even if our side of the house doesn't necessarily make it better, right? Because what happens on his side of the house is that foreign workers are still going to be coming in. They're just going to be coming in illegally the majority of the time, especially for lower level labor jobs where you can jump the border between mexico and the united states. And what this leads to is that people don't have to report those people legally at all, they don't have to ascribe to any kind of laws or protections for them. So you're actually going to get a lot more wage depression on their side of the house because you're going to have more illegal workers who aren't governed by minimum wages and who are actually desperate so are much more likely to be willing to settle for significantly less than what would be the regular market wage. Moreover recognize that foreign workers just fill in for jobs that don't otherwise get filled. It is a misconception that foreign workers are taking jobs because we see that the jobs they are taking are the ones that americans often don't want anyone anyway. And we saw this when fields in the south laid fallow when immigration crackdowns happened in the united states because there was no one to work them. And when these jobs don't get filled that rebounds onto the american economy as a whole because it decreases general production of the economy. For example the fact of those fields didn't produce any food means it didn't get to go to market means people didn't buy it. Like so on so forth and all of those little tendrils that it also impacts like the jobs that it created and the individuals who all of those people are also affected. Also just recognize that foreign workers are often likely to work a lot harder. They often need to send money back home and they want to know they're doing a good job want to demonstrate their work ethic. We think that americans are pretty spoiled and you get less productive output a lot of the time. So if anything competing with foreign workers is likely to make americans more likely to try and do better so that they are competition for the indian engineer and so on so far. We also think it's good that it provides companies with more options for who they want to hire. It means that jobs can be more competitive and hirers know they're getting the best workers at the end of the day. Our second argument is about social benefits. I want to address james' argument about brain drain first because recognize first and foremost that the characterization he gives is just wrong. It is not the case that the majority of these areas are hungering for the types of people who are leaving as foreign workers, right? Like a lot of the time people will leave the areas they are in because they cannot find a job. And also a lot of these people send remittances back which we actually think is more useful than the engineer staying in that area since there simply isn't a sector for them to work in yet, but the money they send back can be used to develop those sectors. I also think that james just avoids the reality of how these often works, right? Like it's not the higher educated engineers that make up the majority of foreign workers. It's oftentimes people who are less educated like we have a lot of foreign workers who come in from mexico and for manual labor as well as a lot of like east asian countries like similar idea. We also just think that contact theory is actually really important here. The idea that people are going to be interacting with these different types of workers and having having positive interactions that build better self images of the world. For all those reasons proud to oppose.
I'll address the points made by side government, and then I'll move on to my constructive argument. So, the first thing, that the previous speaker tells you, is that the government has a responsibility to educate to sex, just like the government needs to educate its pupils in any other aspect. So, firstly, it's just not true that school teaches you everything. Not even everything that matters. School doesn't teach you how to drive, or how to ride a bike, or manners, or most schools don't teach you how to swim, these are all purely the responsibility of parents. Like even if the parents are not an expert on the matter, by the way. More specifically, the school tries very very hard to avoid discussing issues that are controversial, there are no talks about politics in the classroom, you don't speak in favor or against any particular religion, and that's important, that's super important, in the context of this debate. We'll get to that on the constructive. Secondly, they tell you why they shouldn' like why they think that parents shouldn't be the ones that educate children on sex. Why? Because they're no experts on sex education, they are not an expert on how to use contraception, or on STD's. Now, that might be true, but we really don't think that the critical part really needs to be explaining the biology behind STD's, or behind getting pregnant, or whatever. Come on, everybody knows just how much safe sex is important, and everyone can explain to their children about condoms or pills. In fact in ninety nine percent of the cases, we are not even certain that you really need the parents, or the teachers, in order to explain this to high school children. They watch it in movies, and on television, they hear about it from older siblings, or friends that have older siblings, just like tim says, and it's just really basic common knowledge. And you know what? That's fine, we don't really need all of the most professional details, all we need is that the message come across, that, by the end of the day, you need to be careful. It doesn't matter how deeply or professionally we'll discuss this. Lastly, they talk about the huge impact. They say that now, places where there are no sex education classes, children will have unsafe sex, and will get knocked up, and catch ST diesel over the place, and come on, we think that to truly believe that high school kids need their teachers in order to learn anything about sex is just super naive. There is nothing new that they learn in these classes, it's just a sort of a like awkward and embarrassing experience. Maybe sometimes it can be a little bit funny experience, but nobody, and I mean nobody, takes it seriously. So it seems preposterous for us to assume that sex ed classes are what helps you avoid child pregnancies. Now, I don't know where tim gets his data from, on like places without sex education having more problems, but they don't sound reliable, and even if they are, they only establish a correlation at best, and not a causation. To the constructive, so I want to talk about what tim avoids talking about, and these are specific populations that this proposition is going to be very very problematic for. And we're talking of course about religious populations, where any type of sexual education, that is not abstinence only, will be perceived by parents as an attempt of the school, or of the state, to corrupt their children. And we think that the potential to backlash, in this sensitive matter, is huge. As we've already mentioned earlier, schools avoid inserting politics into the classroom, and there's no way around this. Sex is a political issue. It always has been, it always will be, and you know the reason that we don't like to meddle with politics in the schools is twofold: a, it is unclear to us, that the school has the mandate to really decide on matters that are controversial, and has to do with principles and morals. A teacher has an authority over children, sense it is his job to provide them with knowledge. They must assume that whatever he says is true, without doubting him too much. Now if teachers will start discussing issues that are not clear cut, and will make a stand, in this case, like making a stand, for instance, that having sex in a like having sex in a young age, or before marriage is acceptable, then they are doing something unfair. They are abusing their power and their authority. Secondly, we say that in order for the teacher's status not to be harmed, we want to avoid unnecessary conflict between teachers and parents. If I hear that my child is hearing from his teacher all sorts of things that I oppose, I will just tell my child not to listen to anything that that teacher says. My child is now torn between two different systems of authority, that tell him opposing things, and that puts him in an impossible situation. For all of these reasons, please oppose.
The right to internet access shouldn't be protected. Look, we think that the core thing to recognize here is that the government world has to defend why this kind of right needs to be protected infinitely. Like sure, maybe we can believe that people should generally have access to the internet. Maybe we believe that having access to the internet is good. But there's a difference between thinking that something is a good and verses thinking that something should be legally and principally protected as a right. So we think that our side of the house can still recognize why the internet is a good thing and why people should have access to but we just don't think that the government should have a large role in making sure that that right is protected. Two main arguments: first, on why it's not a real right. We see that there are often situations where people should and do have their internet rights taken away if someone is accessing really violent content online, or is participating in criminal activity using the internet as the go between. When we say that something is a right that needs to be protected, those need to be inalienable. IE they exist without having any kind of limitations. Even if someone has done a bad thing we would still see that as a right that ought not be taken away things like the right to life, the right to free speech, etcetera. These are things that we do not compromise regardless of the situation besides for occasional mitigating factors IE if someone's in jail maybe they don't have an absolute right to free speech but you still can't like further punish them for utilizing free speech. James said that it facilitates the right to things like speech and assembly and we think that even without specific protections, most people have access to things like basic messaging and social media networks. So they can still use this to facilitate their basic right but the bigger issue is whether you need all of the internet for facilitative rights and we just don't think that that is the case. Like we think that sure, some aspects might be beneficial but you don't have to have infinite access to all of the internet in order to get that. Moreover, we just don't think that it is a like definitive like definitional part of accessing those rights, right? Like we think that someone can still have free speech if they don't have internet access. Sure, it might be easier to have free speech with internet access but it does not depend on internet access. So we don't think that you can just get away with saying because it is facilitative it has to be protected, rather he would have to show why without internet access there can be no free speech and then maybe he'd have some offense. Our second argument is about internet as a utility. We think that internet is vastly comparable to things like electricity. Like yes, the government should provide some basic infrastructure to make sure it is accessible but we don't think that the government has an obligation to make sure that it is free or accessible in ways beyond that. James talks a lot about how people should be able to access whatever content they want but he forgets that content to something that gets produced by individuals and corporations. So we don't understand why we should undercut their rights to the market to protect people's rights to internet access especially when internet isn't absolutely necessary to life or any of the rights that james lists. He talks about the marketplace of ideas. Like yeah, maybe you we think it's a good idea when people can talk about all their viewpoints but first, we just don't think this always plays out the way that james says. Like he talks a lot about how problematic ideations can get talked out of existence on the internet. But we think this just means he's never been on things like the dark side of reddit where you get plenty of really problematic few points that never get talked out of existence because these people just aren't willing to compromise or individuals who would do the talking out of existence aren't accessing those fears. But also we just think this argument is dependent on proving that everyone should have access in the first place because even if it is true that it might be beneficial to have people talking about these things in the marketplace of ideas, if we show you that the internet isn't necessary to that, he still doesn't win on that argument. Like just because there is a potential positive impact doesn't mean it's a mandated right that we need to protect. Proud to oppose.
We should not fight nationalism. We think that throughout the course of the government speech, they present an idea of nationalism that is a conflation of nationalism in its worst cases with nationalism in all cases. We don't think that nationalism needs to be exclusionary to international cooperation. It doesn't need to be exclusionary to multiculturalism. What nationalism is is a recognition of your national pride. It's seeing your country as something to be proud of, as something to support, and as something to rally around, and we don't think that that is either exclusionary, racist, exclusionary of multiculturalism, racist by definition, nor is it particularly harmful. So first let's address the harms that the government team breaks up brings up. The first is that this just short-circuits the ability to criticize the state, but I would argue that having a strong idea of national pride makes you be more conscious of your state actions. It forces you to have high standards for your leadership and a high standard of how your country should behave, because people will still see the harms that your country is committing. Nationalism will wane when your &amp;hes this sort of fervent nationalism, this sort of inability to self-criticize will wane when bad actions are done. They bring up this example of george w bush using nationalism to justify the invasion in iraq, but they neglect to also mention that george w bush didn't just use nationalism, he also falsified evidence to try and show that iraq was responsible for the attack in nine eleven and that they had weapons of mass destruction, both of which falsified evidence. And once it became clear that that evidence was falsified, nationalism didn't prevent people, even though there is still a significant amount of national pride and nationalism because this was shortly after the terrorist attack that brought together the nation, it still had the outcome of the war becoming very quickly unpopular. So we don't think that nationalism prevents people from thinking critically about their state's actions. They say this is always harmful but we don't think that's the case. A strong sense of national pride can draw you to national service, it can draw you to volunteering for your community, it can draw you to running for public office, all these things that can be incredibly helpful in bringing people together. They provide two ways of fighting nationalism that I think highlight the failure to recognize what nationalism is. Firstly, they say you can promote multiculturalism. But look at something like US nationalism, which the government side brings up throughout their speech. There's an immense amount of nationalism in the united states, but this nationalism is not anti-multicultural. Immigration shapes the idea of national pride, and the idea of what your nation is evolves over time with the makeup of your nation. So we don't think that nationalism is definitionally exclusionary of immigration, but we think it does definitionally make people more likely to be drawn to doing things for their community. The second thing they say you can do is you can support international cooperation and they say, " look at the european union ; they're doing a great job. " But the european union also features many countries that have lots of nationalist history as well as a a a status quo of nationalist action. Look at greece. Look at italy. Look at germany, or look at spain. All of these countries have a large amount of national pride, national identity, an idea of us versus them, but they're still able to cooperate in instances where it matters. The example of donald trump pulling out of the paris climate accord, again, a bad example. Nationalism wasn't his justification, anti-science and political lobbying was his justification. So to recap, we don't think that nationalism is necessarily exclusionary, but we think it does prevent it does bring people to serve their country and for these reasons, we should not fight nationalism.
Don't subsidize embryonic stem cell research. Look, I think that all we're saying is that we're fine with embryonic stem cell research existing, we just don't think that the government should be the one funding it. So when james spends so much of his speech talking about how there are no moral qualms with stem cell research, we agree. That's not what this debate is about, rather it is explicitly about whether it is the government that should be the actor in subsidizing this kind of research rather than leaving it to private corporations. Two reasons it shouldn't, first on political backlash. Although we will generally be personally agnostic on the ethical implications of stem cell research, we have to recognize that there are plenty of people who aren't. We live in a country with a very strong religious leaning. There are plenty of people who assign life to embryos and who are genuinely offended by the concept of stem cell research, not because they're bad people or because they are confused, but rather because their understanding of the world is fundamentally different from someone else's who does not see life as starting at conception. We think that the backlash is also likely to actualize in really bad ways, like cuts to scientific funding more broadly, in addition to the stopping of the stem cell research itself. It also means that people will vote for individuals who are more extreme in these views and believe less in science, so that they won't risk having this kind of thing happen again. Recognize that our funding for sciences as the US government is already constantly on the chopping block, because it isn't seen as something that is absolutely necessary. We think that stem funding embryonic stem cell research is literally just providing a reason for individuals to bring that knife down and make it even lower. We also just think that when james is like saying he's worried about shady research happening in other places that he doesn't understand what he's talking about, like, right? Like, first, we don't think it's the business of the US if there is shady research somewhere else, but also we just think that he's painting an incorrect picture of what countries like thailand or other countries are, right? Like it's not as if they're these savage nations that are just ripping embryos from people's bodies. Like these are people who are incredibly intelligent. They went often to the same schools the scientists in the US went to. They have laboratories, and they're never using like someone else's fetus, rather they are also growing them in a lab, the same way that we would. So we just don't think that james's portrayal is accurate, and if other countries are interested in doing this, we're fine with them doing that. Our second argument is about how there is more important research for the government to be funding. Embryonic stem cells are cool but they are vastly getting outpaced by induced pluripotent stem cells, which don't need to be extracted from embryos. Moreover, we think that the government should be focusing on subsidizing scientific projects that are less experimental and have more clinical potential. Like stem cells, despite all of their written potential, are still vastly theoretical. They're still in the research phase, and we haven't even gotten to the point where we understand them enough to start implementing them in therapeutics. So when james talks about how it'll be good for people who are sick, he doesn't seem to acknowledge that there are infinitely more other kinds of therapeutics and drug approaches that are already much closer to publication and public use that the US government could subsidize to send over the brink and actually help individuals, rather than pouring money into something that is basic research where the benefits won't materialize for at least the next thirty years. We we think that if james actually cares about maximizing the good, then the thing that the US government should actually be subsidizing is this other research and other therapeutic agents that are more close to being official and FDA approved. We also just think that at the end of the day, when james says that this is a short-term investment, we think this is exactly the reason you're not voting side government, right? Like if something is so short term because we know it's about to be obsolete, because we have all this other research, then we might as well just focus on those other research instead of burying ourselves in something that won't get validated in time before that other stuff materializes. Proud to oppose.
Don't ban abortions. Two main arguments, first on promoting women's choice and freedom. I think the most important thing is always going to be that we think that her body should ultimately be the under the governance of her own choice. It shouldn't matter the context of her pregnancy but if you decide to do it that should still be an option you have even if it's not because it's medically necessary which is what james says is the only thing he'd allow. It's just not the case that people should have to defer to these like priorities of this unborn thing just because they happen to get pregnant when we have the medical capabilities to not have to do that. Like recognize that the child is a literal parasite. Like we can say that there is a day on which the fetus is considered a person because it is based on when development has hit a point when it's life starts to actualize. Up till the point it's just a clump of cells that is stealing nutrients and using the energy of this other human who happens to be their host. In the same way that we don't consider either single or clump of cell organisms to be deserving of this potential life kind of status, we don't think fetuses are meaningfully different, besides the idea that if you let them grow for long enough to become a person but we don't think we can weigh that potentiality because if that was true we would do things like allow sperm to have these kinds of legal standings which clearly would be absurd. James says that you can figure out when the you can't figure out when the transition occurs. Like we're fine with limiting abortions to the first two trimesters so that you don't accidentally go over that transition, but given that we know that transition does not occur before those two first two trimesters just scientifically, we think that james is relying on very problematic fear mongering tactics here where he just gets to say like look you could potentially violate someone's rights and get away with it and we just think this isn't fair. He keeps talking about how abortion isn't ethical. Like we just don't think the fetus is a moral agent who deserves the consideration of rights, right? Like we agree that this is about a rights trade off situation, we just think that james is on the wrong side of the trade off. The mother's rights should always matter more. This is because fetuses first don't feel, hear, or even exist in a meaningful sense. They don't contribute to society, they don't change societal fabric except for the mother and like maybe the father to some extent. And insofar as that mother is like a real person who cares about their potential future, who has a life established, we think that that person's rights are always going to matter more. Like recognize that a fetus cannot contextualize its life so if it stops existing you're not doing any damage to it because it never had a future that it valued. Meanwhile mothers and like the women who give birth to fetuses are people who can imagine what their future would look like and they can imagine what kind of harm is caused to that future when they are forced into having a child. So we're always going to care about that more just because of the amount of harm that you're causing is infinitely larger because it is actually conceptualized. This is about the life potential of the mother verses that fetus, like we don't consider miscarriages homicides because we recognize that these are just not things that are valued by comparison to the individual who is giving birth. So we think that this is just not something james could ever win on. Our second argument is about why it's good for society. Like no we just don't think the state should protect the fetus. Like if we show you that it comes at the cost of all of the rest of society, then we just outweigh on magnitude right? And given that we get less unwanted children who then end up often relying on the state when they're given up for adoption and no one takes them over but also we get less single mothers who tend to be the lowest income kind of parents and tend to be on that intersection of poverty as well and also rely on the state that's something that we get less of. And you also just get more women who are pursuing careers in the futures that they actually want and are capable of contributing to society, also something we think could independently win the round. Proud to oppose.
Don't subsidize investigative journalism. Tim and I agree on the majority of the positives that investigative journalism does. What we don't agree on is whether or not those benefits go away once the government starts funding them because tim keeps talking about how look this money just isn't going to be tied to anything you'll just get a flat check based on your success but he forgets exactly how wishy washy government funding can be. It's not as if they take away funding and tell you this is because you didn't like put up the stories that we wanted you to or because you portrayed a politician in a bad light, rather they'll give a different excuse. They'll say " hey we ran out of funding " or " you were less successful than a comparable like company that happened to portray us in a more positive light but isn't the reason that we're taking away that funding ". So like the problem here is that tim's model just doesn't adjust for the fact that governments tend to be corrupt, that funding tends to be wishy washy at best, and that in the status quo we have a pretty good system for making sure that investigative journalism happens. Two main arguments: first, on preventing the corruption of journalism. The role of investigative journalism is important because they're willing to investigate groups that other journalists or detectives aren't willing to dive into things like government cover-ups, corporate schemes, political cover-ups, and even if tim says that this money won't have any strings attached, this is something that is unlikely to happen in reality as long as the government is able to withdraw the funding when they feel like it. Like as I told you it's not as if they're going to say " we're withdrawing funding because of the kinds of things you reported " but they can easily insinuate during the investigation that money will be affected maybe behind closed doors when they're not being recorded in the way that can be no proof and then they take it away and say it was for some other reason later on if the group doesn't go along with their with their demands. Investigative journalism is one of the few checks we have against the government. We need to make sure that they are left completely free from these outside influences and the only way we can do that is to keep it an is to keep it without government funding. Our second argument is about precluding private donations. Once a sector starts receiving public funding private donors tend to be less likely to keep donating because they feel like that sector is taken care of. We see this a lot with public museums that start receiving public funding and we see massive drops in the amount of private funding they receive specifically because of this issue where private donors have this fungible amount of money that if they feel like isn't going to be doing its best or is going to an industry that doesn't need it, they're going to withdraw it and send it somewhere else. This is really bad because most private donations are actually bigger and more generous than the government to come in over time. So the other problem here is that government funding is madly inconsistent. It can be taken away at any point in time with changes in political leadership, changes in budgets and the whereas private donorship might be also inconsistent in some ways but you can at least rely oftentimes on like one rich person who may be supports you over the course of multiple years, you can rely on donations from your viewers the way a lot of like NPR investigative journalism does. Like those figuring out those alternative pathways of funding tend to result in much more consistent funding than unpredictable government. We also just don't want journalism to get reliant on government funding in the first place because then you'll have this massive dip or like a lot of struggle if something does happen with that funding. Like in the status quo, journalism has learned how to make do but if you get spoiled by consistent funding over time, if that funding gets taken away, you struggle even more than if you never had it in the first place just because you've gotten used to it. This is something we want to avoid because it would end up with a lapse in investigative journalism being able to occur. Proud to oppose.
It is true that almost any program where we spend money and let's be honest, that's what the government tends to do, is going to increase taxes and that always hurts the middle class, especially in the short term, and that's an unfortunate fact. But as the government is so keen to tell us, let's look to the long term and see that with the american jobs act, we get more people being educated, we have more people with jobs, and we have more people with stable jobs, and that's better for a stable economy which benefit which benefits us all in the long term. So what we think, ladies and gentlemen, is that we have to look at what we're really spending the money on to see why it's such a good idea to have this american jobs act, especially as a short-term, not as a short-term solution, a long-term solution with a by by implementing a short-term program. What we're spending money on are the following things, okay? The jobs act does a number of key crucial things and and and here's what it does. First of all, it ensures that those receiving unemployment benefits are getting adequate funds to provide for themselves and their families. So it's easy for the government to come and say, " well, if you give them too much, then it's just going to not be worthwhile for them to get a job. " But first of all, we say that that is simply not true. Human nature is that most people prefer to have a job, most people prefer to bring home a working wage and not receive government benefits. We also think that there would be very little very few situations in which your minimum wage would be would be less than what you're making with the with the unemployment benefits. But why is it important to to make sure that these people are getting adequate funds? Because the funds that they're getting today are not always adequate for them to go out and find a job. Because when you're a parent, for example, especially a single parent, and you need to go out and you need to look for jobs and you need to interview for your for jobs or you need to get training for a job, what do you do with your children? You can't afford daycare, you can't afford a babysitter, you can't afford necessarily to leave them with someone else. That's the kind of thing that we need to make sure that these people are able to do, that they're able to go out and look for those jobs without worrying about leaving their children with somebody alone with somebody or or or not have the money, the resources to do that. We can't or what about those people who can't afford to take classes, who can't afford to obtain a degree or certificate that will help them get those jobs? We think that that's the kind of money that we need to be spending today in the short term in order to ensure that they have long-term perspectives. Second of all, we think that the american jobs act encourages and assists people in finding jobs and that benefits everyone in the economy. So we have directly threw the pathways back to work program, which we think is an incredibly important program, to invest and and and indirectly by bettering public learning institutions. We don't think that the government has properly addressed where is this money going. It's going to better public learning institutions. It's going to better public schools and colleges that are open to people and making sure that people have access to the education that they need to get good jobs. We don't think it's enough to throw money into a high-tech industry when there's an entire strata of class of people in our society who can't access those jobs. Those jobs are limited to people who have been through top-notch educational institutions. Not everyone can afford those. We need to make sure that our institutions that we better our public institutions so that everyone can access all types of jobs. And also we say that we're spending money on protecting vital jobs, things like teachers, firefighters, police people. That's not something we can choose to ignore. We can't choose to put money into high-tech jobs and ignore the fact that that we're losing out on that that that that we don't have enough firefighters or police people to to protect our society. These are things that we need to be investing money into, and it makes sense for us to take money from the people who have it in small amounts, through taxes, even if it means a small increase in taxes, in order to be able to afford everyone the same these these opportunities and to ensure that those people who today don't have jobs can access those jobs in the future. Thank you very much.
So eitan gets philosophical and tells us that time is a fluid human construct in that it can be played with. We'll go with him. It's just that daylight saving time is exactly that. It's playing with time. Now, we're also accepting that the main question in this debate is under what kind of world is it going to be less inconvenient and less annoying? Now all that's left to do is to compare between the status quo, where we apply daylight savings time, and eitan's proposition of just keeping the time constant and playing with the work hours. We argue that the status quo, albeit not perfect, is clearly preferable to what side government is is asking us to do, purely on basis of convenience. So eitan tells us, " what's the problem? " Simply play with the hours and , you know, divide the year up to seasons and decide that in each season, the working day begins and ends in a different time. Now this is what he he calls the elegant solution. As my mom always says, " when something sounds too simple to work, then it's probably because it is. " Not what eitan didn't think of is that it would require perfect coordination on a huge scale for his solution to actually work. It's not enough that my boss would tell me: listen, in these months, come to come work an hour earlier. I also need my son's school to announce that in in the exact same dates, school starts an hour earlier and that I need that the buses will match themselves in the hours and, you know, the routes an hour backwards, meaning I need everything to start working an hour earlier. I need the coffee place where I buy buy my morning coffee and bagels to start working an hour earlier, and so on. We we believe that the picture is starting to get clearer now in the sense of affecting international businesses and trade and, you know, calculating the hour gaps. We haven't really helped that much since I will still have to remember when the new york offices, for instance, are like when is the time where they are when they open at six AM and when is the time where they open at seven AM, and that's still a recipe for a lot of little misunderstandings and a lot of nerves. Where does all of this analysis take us? It takes us to the realization that the only way in which this solution could actually work and not create a lot of mismatches between different functions in the market and so on is that's we like we need all of the country to collectively and in an organized way, without any exceptions, declare that we are moving the working hours of everyone an hour backwards or an hour forwards. Now, pay attention that in this situation, it is more or less identical to a situation in which we collectively just decide to move the clock an hour backwards or an or an hour forwards. Only if we compare between the two , you know, with one situation I can just remember that, you know, the the local clinic for instance is always open until six six PM, but if I start playing with the hours, like side government is suggesting, then I would have to always remember what time it is, like what type of season it is, and calculate whether this time the local clinic is going to be open until five or six or seven. So, all in all, it sounds like a more irritating world, a less convenient world, so by side government's own criteria, we win the debate, and we call you to oppose this motion.
Don't protect whistleblowers. Two main arguments, first on protecting national security. I think the problem with a lot of danny of what danny says is that he just assumes that the majority of information that whistle blowers release are that which is harmless to like other issues of national security and other individuals within the government but potentially very important to the citizens. So like only information about the government spying on them or only information about atrocities that have been committed. But this just isn't the kind of material that whistleblowers come into contact with the majority of the time and we think the problem becomes when you don't have a high enough punishment for information that can genuinely harm individuals aside from just showing us what the government is doing badly. For example I think that when the information might include the locations of certain government operatives or other like strategy plans for the military, these are things that can fundamentally change the US's ability in the long term to interact with these other countries, to protect their operatives that they have on the ground there, and that's something where you have to have the punishment be fairly high to make sure that people aren't messing up like the country and the people within it. Like we think that the people who have the potential to whistleblow are working with ridiculously sensitive information and the majority of it just isn't that bad from what danny is saying but is really bad in terms of the impacts it can have on longtime long term strategy and individuals who work for the government who are out in the field. And in the midst of anything problematic the government might be doing, this information must be protected. Danny talks a lot about how people's lives are on the line and that's why we need to protect whistleblowers but this cuts both directions. Like there are also plenty of people's lives on the line when national security secrets get spilled. Our second argument is about upholding justice. First we just think it is the case that whistleblowers know what they're getting into. They sign contracts where they are sworn to silence, they get told what the punishment is going to be. Like it is not the case that whistleblowers whistleblow without knowing what's going to happen once they come out. Like most of these people have spent decades working with high level classified information. They are government contractors. They've seen what happens to other whistleblowers as well. Like we think that this is something that is very well known and well deserved at the point that they have consented to the potential harms. It's just a matter of making sure that they are punished in the way that the law says. Moreover we think that we want the calculus to be absurdly high in order to be a whistleblower. In the case of the majority of the information released by whistleblowers will have side effects that impact national security and the people within a nation in a bad way, we think that we need to have them think that it is worth all of the losses that they're going to bear as a result. Which means the punishment should be very high so that only the most important instances of whistleblowing actually go through. The really important whistleblowing is likely to happen on both sides of the house. The stuff that danny says about really about human rights violations etcetera, like we see that edward snowden exists regardless of how high the punishment for whistleblowing is because we see that there are individuals who are willing to compromise their own future security because they think the secrets the government is holding are that important. But we think that anything less than that situation should not be allowed to occur. The problem with protecting whistleblowers is that you are sending the message to them that they can take the action without consequences. This means that when you protect whistleblowers in a legal sense, you're just going to get more of them in the long term which is really bad because it raises the probability of them releasing information that could have really deleterious effects just because they didn't think about the decision for long enough or just because the cost benefit analysis wasn't enough to tell them that the cost was too high. Proud to oppose.
We should not end water fluoridation. In this round, we're going to respond to the arguments made by the government side explaining why we why they think that water fluoridation should be ended and explain why their argumentation is misinformed and misguided. So the first argument that they make is that essentially forcing water fluoridation on people is bad because tap water is the source of water for the majority of people in countries like the united states that have fluoride in their water and that people should have an expectation of what they say is pure water. We think that that is kind of silly just given the fact that people are totally fine with the government doing any number of things to the water in order to make sure that it's clean for them to use. If the government pulled out of of cleaning the water altogether, then in countries like the united states where the tap water is currently clean, you would eventually have a system in which the water was unclean, and you wouldn't be able to drink from the tap water. So no one has an expectation of pure water. There are just some people, an angry minority of people, that think that fluoride is bad for them and are misinformed about the actual impacts of fluoride, but we don't think it's necessary for an angry minority to govern what the majority are going to put into their bodies. If the angry minority is so outraged by this, they have the alternative of drinking bottled water. Like bottled water may not be free, like tap water is, but it's not all that expensive. And if it really is that big of a concern for them, they can probably shift their spending there from some other source that they're currently spending on. The government says that we should defer to allowing people to make their own decisions, but we think that when people are actively misinformed, which is what's happening in this case, those people that think fluoride is bad, don't just think it's bad because they don't want the government to be putting anything in their water, any chemicals in their water, but it's because they think that this chemical that is being put into their water has negative effects, and it's because of false false information that's been perpetuated within the state that people have clung onto. But we think when people are making misinformed choices, those choices become invalid, because they're not being based on any sort of factual reasoning. We think in instances where there's an asymmetry of information, the government, all the time, makes decisions based on what's in the people's best interest. And when you look at the approval of fluoride in the water amongst people that, you know, actually understand that fluoride isn't bad for you, there's no disapproval of it. They're fine with it. So we don't think that this is something that we need to defer to, in this instance, because while we generally agree that allowing people to make their own decisions is good, we don't think that people are really making a valid decision if they're misinformed like they are in this situation. And it's not just that they're it's not that they're uninformed, it's that they're actively misinformed. They have a belief that is false and because of that, we think it's fine for the government to intervene. The second argument they make is that this is just not necessary in modern times because you have the option to just brush your teeth daily with fluoride toothpaste. But recognize that the reality is many people don't just they just don't brush their teeth every day. They don't take proper care of their teeth, whether it's because they're lazy, whether it's because they don't realize the effects of not brushing their teeth, there are just a number of people that don't brush on a regular basis, and this solves for that issue. The final argument that they make is that this is a poor use of government funds, and they recognize that it's not massively expensive but that sources resources are fungible within the state budget. And while it's certainly true that resources are fungible and maybe, theoretically, there are other places that you could put the spending to that's more impactful, we think that the reality is that it's much easier to keep spending on systems that are already in place than it is to try and pass new spending resolutions. People are generally okay with spending that exists in the status quo and actively don't want to cut current spending, but people also don't want to increase spending or shift spending elsewhere. This is why it's so hard to pass legislation in the united states. And so we don't think that this fungible resource will actually go to some better end. For these reasons, we should not end water fluoridation.
One main argument on why athletic scholarships are better for the individual. Before that five points of external rebuttal. One, james start by telling you, quote: " they are coerced because only this is their only ticket out so there's no free choice. " Two responses: a, a good deal does not mean it is coercion. Just because this is clearly their best choice, because it's their only way to get a quality academic training, does not mean that it's negative forms of coercion. But b, note that if this option is taken away, they're not coerced any less, it's one fewer options. That means they're now coerced into whatever the negative alternative that they otherwise would have been forced into is. If that's a life of poverty, if that means getting a job as a waiter because they can no longer get an academic degree, whatever it is they're just as coerced into it and it's probably worse for them. Two, he says they work for free. We generally don't let people work for favors. Note we do allow people to intern. When do you intern? When something that you do now for free is massively beneficial to your ability to maintain a future career. In this case, either a future career as someone who needs a degree or a future career as an athlete, both things are massively pushed forward by you having an athletic scholarship in the university, meaning we find this to be similar to an internship which is perfectly acceptable. Three, he says you can't quit. Wait a second, yes you can. He says: " wait, but then you'll lose your scholarship. " Yeah, the same way if you quit a job you'll lose your salary. A contract is only negative if it literally can't be broken, not if there are consequences to breaking the contract. Fourthly he says: " here's what happens. The NFL would have to pay if it weren't for the academic world making money off of this. " This means it's a mutually beneficial. That's not a bad thing that the NFL saves money while academia makes money. Which leads me to five, he tells us this is a poor use of funds and that they are losing resources that otherwise could have been used. No no no. James doesn't understand how athletics work in colleges. They make more money off of them than they spent. Want some proof of this? A, note that in an institution incentivized by academia they would have no reason to even have sports programs. You can see this in the fact that the united states is the only country in the world where this kind of thing happens. Why is that the only country basically the only country in the world? B, because they're the only ones with massive financial incentives in doing so. They are for profit institutions. How does this make them more money? Through sponsorships, through deals with the NFL and the NBA with scouts, through ticket sales, through merchandise, through people wanting to come to schools based on sporting events, through getting more money out of alumnis because of the cult thoughts surrounding sports teams that these university have. The bottom line is if it weren't good for the schools' financial bottom line, they wouldn't be doing this. They are making more money than they're spending which means all of james's points are not on his side of the house, there on ours. We can offer better academia we can offer more external scholarships than we could have done if it weren't for these athletes. Let's talk about why it's good for the individual. Basically, one of two things if possible. Either this is an individual who is only athletically inclined or this is an individual who is both athletically and educationally inclined. If this individual is only athletically inclined this means two things happen here: a, he is given an athletic chance by playing in these leagues. Now sure, it is true he would have given been eh he may have been given just as much a chance through the NFL etcetera, but note that there are more colleges than the NFL needs people. This means that there is a wider net of people given a chance when it's done through athletic scholarships. Or secondly he also gets some sort of education. Meaning he is forced to, to some extent, study to keep his GPA up to some minimal degree. It means he's given more options if athletics don't work up for him. The second option is in somebody who's also academically inclined. This means you're giving a person who should have had a degree the ability to get that degree because of his sporting abilities in a world where financially he likely would not have been able to do so otherwise. For all of these individuals it's far better to live in a world with athletic scholarships. Please maintain them.
We should not abolish capital punishment. So before we get into the government's side of this case, we want to first explain our principle for why we think capital punishment is justified, and then we'll go into those arguments. So we think that as a matter of principle, rights are inherently not something that are inherent or an an unalienable part of humanity, but rather rights are a social construct that relies on people having mutual respect for each other's rights. We think that that is the key determinant in why we think that capital punishment is acceptable. It's because certain criminals violate that mutual respect. And in instances in which those criminals take that action, they kill somebody, they take someone else's life, they show that they themselves have no respect for rights on a principled basis, that they do not value human life, they do not think it is sacred, and they do not think that it cannot be taken away, even if it's just tacitly through taking away someone else's life. Given that that is the case and they have made that acknowledgment and have acted upon that, we think that it gives up any claims that these individuals have to those rights. And, in fact, in order to be proportional in your response, in order to carry out justice, we think it is, in fact, required that the state take capital punishment from time to time. We are absolutely fine, on our side of the house, as well, with limits. We're going to get into that a little bit. But we think that there's no reason that we need to defend a status quo in which capital punishment is overused, but rather in instances of only instances in which you've taken someone else's life and only in instances where you have near certainty of the conviction should you be able to do this. So on to the government's arguments. The first thing they say is that this is just incredibly cruel and it basically matches standards of cruel and unusual punishment. So, we think that, first, it was also incredibly cruel when the criminal took some sort of action against their victim that cost their victim this life. But the difference between the criminal and the victim is that the victim did absolutely nothing to be deserving of this harm, whereas the criminal has opted into a system in which they themselves have tacitly agreed that this harm is an acceptable risk and an acceptable outcome for them. And as far as whether this is cruel or unusual, firstly, we think that in terms of cruelty, it's debatable as to whether or not it's more cruel to simply end someone's life or to keep them in a jail for decades, potentially, in which they know they have no chance of seeing the outside, in which they have no chance of ever escaping their confinement, in which they're forced to labor in this jail for essentially their entire life, in poor conditions, and we don't think it's unusual, by any standard, given that the death penalty has existed for, well, basically, all of human history. Then they go on to say that the death penalty, capital punishment, is racist and it's arbitrary, because the judge basically gets to decide whether you get this or a life sentence. And, again, we think that any that reform of how capital punishment is enacted, whether its reform over the degree of certainty that is necessary before it can be given or whether or not the judge has discretion to use it, all these things can be corrected through proper legislation, but in order to actually have justice in instances of things like murder, we think it is necessary that capital punishment is undertaken. Then the government says, " look, you could punish the innocent. " And that's why we think that there should be certainty in order to act. But, honestly, there are many instances of near certainty, especially in today's modern age with DNA testing and with modern forensics. And the final argument the government side makes is, essentially, that this is just really expensive. But this debate is not about the cost of the government or even the cost to the taxpayer, this is about a criminal that has so fundamentally violated our fabric of rights and our social fabric that justice can only be done in instances in which capital punishment is applied. For these reasons, we should not abolish capital punishment.
We should not end mandatory retirement. In this round we're going to argue that what we need, the reason that mandatory retirement is so important is because in a society without mandatory retirement it's much more difficult to create a recycling of the workforce that allows those that really need to be working, people like recent college graduates, people that are younger and don't have money saved up, that it allows them to get into the workforce and that it creates increased political will for things like social security so that people can enjoy their retirement. So three arguments that the government side makes. The first is that this is discriminatory against the elderly and that age is an arbitrary line. But we think that it's important that you create opportunity for the youth and if you don't have mandatory retirement it entrenches the elderly in their current work forces because of things like political clout within the office space, because of seniority, these are the types of things that make it not only difficult to get a job in a workplace but also difficult to advance in the ranks to the point where you're making a sufficient amount of money. And the fact that age is arbitrary, we don't actually think that age age is that arbitrary. For example, by age sixty five, which is the example they give, you probably had sufficient amount of time to save money so that you can support yourself in a way that young people have not been able to do. If you're sixty five years old and I'm twenty five years old and you've been in the workplace forty years longer than me that's forty years worth of nickel and diming that you could have done to put away a nice nest egg for yourself whereas I'm probably still paying off my student loans. In fact, I am still paying off my student loans. So we don't think that it's arbitrary to give preference in the workplace to younger people who are more dependent on the resources that a work place can provide than the elderly. Secondly they say this harms the work force. And the first point under this is that because people aren't being asked to retire in the status quo without the system, it means they're doing a good job. But there are other reasons why companies may not fire someone. I already mentioned that there might be a lot of political clout in the workforce supporting that person, it's also the fact that you don't have to train a new person to come in. It's a lack of training costs which can be fairly costly for the employer and there's a reason why many companies will allow people to have second third or fourth chances after they've shown that they're not competent at their job. Because it just costs so much money to train a new employee. There's also a fear of lawsuits based on things like age discrimination. And so we think just because there's someone in the job it doesn't mean that they're doing a good job. But even if it is true that all of these people are doing a good job we think that there are comparative gains that come from having younger peoples. For example having new ideas in the work force, bringing in different cultures into the workforce and different ideas of how these of how these jobs should function. And we think that you're still going to have tons of people in the office, even with mandatory retirement, that bring things like leadership, which the government is so strong about, but it's important that you get younger people bringing in new ideas for a new generation. We think that that's how business stays revitalized. That's how business continues to push the boundaries. It's not by allowing the same people that have been in the room for decades to keep dictating where the company is going but rather to recycle that leadership, to recycle the body of employees so you got new blood in there and you have new ideas coming in from the outside. The final thing that they say that government says is there's no fair standard and that our side needs to explain a fair and clear standard because different jobs have different physical requirements, and so sixty five is an age of retirement may be far too old for a mason but way too young for professor. Look, we think that this is a silly burden. Many laws create limits that are arbitrary in one way or another, but we think the point of this, the consequence of these laws is that a single high age that you can provide give us both ability to recycle the workforce and gives ability for people to save their money throughout their career so that they can prepare for retirement. We think that this is a good balance that does over all good creates positive utility for society, and for these reasons we should not and mandatory retirement.
Two reasons we oppose boarding schools. One, because of the emotional harm, and two, because of an educational harm via a monopoly on the education of the pupils. A few points of rebuttal. One, james starts by telling us that there's more to education than just books. There is physical education and there is social education. We absolutely agree. He never discusses how these things happen and where they happen in a boarding school. Because we think on the social level, for example, there are always those pupils who are unpopular within their class and within their peers. In their world, they have nowhere to go. They have no alternative for socialization, because everyone surrounding them are the same people who mock them for being good in math class. In our world, they get to go home, they get to socialize with their siblings, with their parents, and often with their neighbors and friends from their neighborhood. We think we get that far more on our side of the house. Second, he says things like tutoring and sports can happen more. We say they're not mutually exclusive. You can have after-school tutoring and sports in a regular school. He says travel hinders people from doing it. A, you can have it in the home neighborhood, but b, most people just don't travel that far from school. People tend to go to school locally. Thirdly, he says this reduces inequality. We find this an odd argument, since everyone going to boarding schools are rich in the first place, because the reason they can provide so much warm food, and tutoring, and all these great things, so to speak, for their pupils, is because they have lots of money, because all their students pay a ton of money in order to go there. So we don't think this reduces inequality, if anything, if he's right that the education here is better and that they're considered better either way, we think it increases inequality drastically in that it's only accessible to the richer students. Fourth, he says it creates a situation in which it's easier to reduce bullying. We don't think that's the case. A few reasons why. A, note that generally, the only people a pupil is willing to tell about the bullying are his parents, with whom he has such a tight, close emotional bond and enormous trust. The reason is because the psychological harm a bully creates on the person he's bullying is such of fear, meaning that you're afraid to tell anyone about what's happening to you. So we think it's often more difficult to discover in a situation where the person being bullied has nobody they can tell about it, such as in a boarding school. But even when it is discovered, we think the ability to treat it is minimal, because these people are put together the entire day. This means that they're together in class, in recesses, but also when they supposedly would have been going home to eat dinner and to go to sleep. All of this means you cannot be watching them all the time, and that the person being bullied is constantly in fear, as opposed to being in fear, say, half the day. Not great either way, but better on our side of the house. Lastly, he says in real life you're away from your parents, so this is good preparation. This is a silly argument. It's like saying, in real life people are assholes, so we should be assholes to little kids so they get used to it. There are things that kids need to learn in baby steps. Being away from shelter, being away from love, being away from your parents, is one of those things that it's probably better to be picked up as a scale late in high school, maybe in university, than during grade school. Let's talk about our two arguments. One, on emotional harm. Put very simply. We say children and teenagers have emotional needs, and these needs partially can only be met by their parents. At the point at which you rip a child away from his home, note, with no agreement of that child who generally has no say at that point, it creates immense emotional distress to that child. Now, some of them deal with it fine, others don't, and we think that's massively problematic. Secondly, we say there's an educational harm via a monopoly on education. One of the greatest things about school is that it is one out of two fountains of knowledge, the second one being discoverable alone by the child through friends, through family, or through the internet. All of this doesn't happen when the person is at boarding school constantly being watched by the people entrusted to educate him. Now, what does that mean? Sure, he gets more knowledge from those people, but he only has one individual single source of knowledge which is not combatted with anything. We say in general, that is bad for your source of knowledge to not be combatted with any other external sources of knowledge, it gives too much power to the people educating you, and for all these reasons we oppose the motion.
We should not cancel pride parades. We think that, well, pride parades may certainly celebrate parts of the LGBT community more than others. While they may not be perfect, they are certainly necessary in order to give a marginalized community that still faces immense discrimination an opportunity to celebrate themselves as valuable human beings. The first argument that the government makes is that the pride parades provide a problematic narrative of the LGBTQ community. It paints this community as a certain type of people, often as flamboyant individuals, and also that it often excludes trans people. A number of responses to this: firstly we think that in, first let's address the argument about trans people. First, in all honesty we think that the trans community should probably be separated from the LGBT from the LGB community. We think that sexual orientation is a distinct is distinct from the identity that one holds over their gender, and many people that identify as trans don't feel a particularly strong tie to gay and lesbian individuals. But additionally even if this is the case that they should be a unified community and that it excludes trans people, we still think that it's important that the marginalized members of the LGB community should be allowed to have this opportunity to express themselves and allowed to remove their marginalization for a time. In terms of the idea that this is about only people that are flamboyant and that's the painting that's that's shown of these communities first, we think that this has changed dramatically. Maybe back in san francisco in the mid nineteen nineties that's what the pride parades looked like, banal pride parades have become much more mainstream. There's all sorts of gay and lesbian groups that come together from all walks of life that want to bring out an idea of what it means to be gay and to tell people, especially young people that they should be proud of who they are. There's a massive narrative of accepting yourself and of how it's, additionally, okay to be in the closet. One of the things that happens around the time of pride and pride parades is that there are many people that post on social media, very famous and celebrities that are in the community, they talk about how it's okay to be in the closet. But additionally it also allows many people to find a community. For example: my brother is gay. My brother recently came out of the closet and and told us that he was gay. My brother went to a pride parade for the first time in his life last year and found a community that he wasn't going to be able to find in the rural conservative part of new jersey that I am from. And my brother isn't particularly flamboyant. My brother doesn't fit into the stereotypes of what it means to be gay. But he found acceptance. He found pride at these parades. And that is an immensely valuable experience to the thousands and millions of people that suffer without a community around them. Pride gives an opportunity for people to come together and we think that that's incredibly important. The other, the next argument that they make is that this creates a false perception of LGBT people and that a glasses over those darkest parts of discrimination. So while it may not talk exclusively about the worst parts of the discrimination that exists, we think you need to have times of celebration so that people can continue to fight. If every aspect of the gay movement is all about people talking about the hardships that they experience and depressing themselves, we think that people lose the ability to fight on. People lose the ability to advocate over enough time because they just become so worn out. You need things like pride in order to celebrate your successes along with motivating people to continue to fight. The final argument they make is about backlash. We think that it's just the case that stereotypes are going to exist anyway and if people already if people are so hateful and so angry about pride parades that they're willing to commit violent acts against these people, we think that these are likely the people that are the most bigoted and likely aren't the ones that are being moved because of pride parades but because of a number of other social factors. For these reasons we should not cancel pride parades.
Not only is a retirement age a disgusting form of institutionalized discrimination, it is also extremely pernicious to low income families, we're going to talk about both those things. Before that, a few points of refutation to yaar. Yaar says, otherwise they're going to be fired before, or at best, a few years later. That's not going to happen. Why? A, all of yaar's reasons, for them not being fired the day before they reach retirement age, something that note, can happen, it's perfectly legal, still hold tomorrow. It's still true that, in order to attract the best workers I need to give them benefits that include job security in old age. It is still true that, in order to not bum out everyone around in the office, I need to not fire the sweet old guy who's been doing his job. Obviously, if they stopped doing their job that's a different story. Crucially and secondly, most industries aren't ever changing. In most industries, it's not like the computer world where new inventions are happening every week, right? Most of these places, the fashion world, the building world, the construction world, the whatever it is you want to talk about, things stay pretty much the same, and years and years of experience are a massive gift to the individual. What does that mean? It means that, it's not that eventually, they'll be fired anyway a few years later. It means that, most of these people get to quit on their own terms, when they've had enough, when they managed to save enough, when they have put aside enough, for retirement, and you're taking that away from them. Yaar says this is less embarrassing than being fired, and we need to protect their dignity. Well, this is a hell of a lot more embarrassing than leaving on your own damn terms, when your ready to leave. Let's talk about rights. Because, even if some people are being saved from humiliation, who, in god's name, said you get to take everyone else's right to work, to support themselves and their family, in order to protect a few people's dignity? This is the worst form of ageism. Yaar agrees, he opens by saying: yes we agree this is ageism. What's his point then? His point is analogous to saying, well, sure it's ageism, but we should fire every woman when she gets to thirty, because some of them are going to get pregnant and fired over that, and that'll be embarrassing to them, so let's make sure to avoid that. That's not ok, you don't get that use people's individuality to construct a less offensive way to for for corporations to fire some individuals. Each person is a person to their own right, and you do not get to fire them based on irrelevant qualities. You want to test people, to make sure they're still competent every year after they hit seventy? That's fine, but you can't fire them just because they get to a certain age. Secondly, let's talk about what this does to lower income families, because yaar seems to assume that, dignity is waiting for them at home. To people who have been working low income jobs income jobs their whole lives, dignity is not what's waiting for them on the other side of the firing realm. What's waiting for them is cold, is poverty, is hunger, because they don't have enough money to sustain themselves for an ever rising number of years that you live, passed when you've been fired for being old. These people are not being spared humiliation, they're being forced into a cycle of humiliation and poverty, when they need to go to soup kitchens to to sustain themselves, or beg on their children's doors for a bed to sleep in. If these are the only people being harmed, it's still not ok to fire everyone, just because they hit sixty five. Please, oppose this atrocious rule.
We should not abolish bitcoins. While we acknowledge that just like any new and emerging technology there are issues that revolve around bitcoins, we think that overall bitcoins have become an important part of economic activity, that they facilitate a future that doesn't require state intervention in markets and ultimately that the issues the government side brings up are overblown. The first argument the government side makes is that bitcoins are mostly used for black market purchases and they acknowledge that while there are legitimate businesses that are now accepting bitcoin, it's still mostly just used for illicit activity. We disagree with that characterization of the proportion of actions with bitcoins being used for illicit activity. Firstly, many people view bitcoin has a legitimate investment opportunity and therefore huge portions of bitcoins that are owned in the economy are owned as an investment tool rather than as a means for facilitating exchange in the market and this actually highlights an important problem not with cracking down on bitcoin which that if all the sudden you say you can't use bitcoin anywhere it has no value whatsoever then all the sudden the billions of dollars that have been invested in bitcoin disappear which causes tremendous economic hardship for those that have invested in bitcoin and we think that this is a unjust way of using government resources to crackdown on exchanges that prior to now have been entirely legal and people viewed as a possible investment opportunity. We think that because the government had not gave -warning about this and we don't think the government is just going to buy those bitcoins back, we think that's highly unlikely given the amount of capital it would take to do so, we think that that would be unjust. Secondly, it's also true, as the as the government side acknowledges, that bitcoins are used more and more for actually exchanging for actual market facilitation so it's not just black market activities and so we think that given that there is legitimate use of bitcoins you maybe need to crackdown on the black market in other ways. You can do things like take down sites like the pirate bay and take down sites that like the silk road but we think that ultimately, the bitcoins themselves are not the root of the problem and we can see this because of the fact that before bitcoin was around sites like the silk road still existed and people had no problem facilitating illegal activities over the internet with things like with with other activities and other technologies that allow them to hide their IP, hide their transaction. So we don't think that this is going to meaningfully crackdown a black market behavior. The second argument they make is that this leads to tax avoidance and that that is super problematic. Well firstly, we think that bitcoin exchange is such a tiny proportion of tax avoidance that currently happens. We think if we're going to spend resources on cracking down on bitcoin because of tax purposes, then we should probably put more of those resources into closing the existing tap tax loopholes that we have and facilitating better tax collection overall. But more importantly, we just don't think that this is a major problem. We think that while it's true that people can avoid taxes, you are this argument is outweighed by the fact that in a system in which you have rampant use of bitcoin in which it's would which it's largely accepted you can move away from an economy that is facilitated by a state that no one consented into, that has regulations that many people view are unjust and taxes that many people view are unjust. While we think that state the state apparatus is probably a necessary evil, we think that there are many people that have legitimate qualms with the state and ultimately they should be able to take action just shift their activities outside of that state apparatus which bitcoin provides them an opportunity to do. For these reasons, we should not abolish bitcoins.
Ladies and gentleman, this debate is not about morality. This is a debate about how the government can and should spend my hard-earned money, our hard-earned money, that is then relayed through taxes how they should spend that tax money. And so, ladies and gentleman, everything that we heard from the government's case or most of what we heard from the government's case is irrelevant. Why? First of all, he started with his morality point, and we say this point is totally unnecessary in this debate. The state does not have to get bogged down in the moral issues here. All they have to say is we are not subsidizing. We are not going to use taxpayer money to subsidize this industry or this research, but we are going to allow it to exist. And we are going to allow private entities to put money into this industry and into this research, ladies and gentlemen. We think that the government doesn't always have to take a side. Second of all, the idea of the black market. We think that the great thing about a government is that whether or not they are a main contributor or a contributor to a certain field, they get to regulate industries no matter what. So they get to regulate the research of this of of of stem cell research whether or not they subsidize it. And we think that that whether or not they give a some amounts of money or some sort of incentive isn't going to change how much people within that industry care about the test subjects. So we think that that point is totally moot. And then we heard this idea of why is it needed, right, cause it's hard to raise money. And here we're already starting to get into my case, but I'm going to refute his his point first. We say yaar told us that it's hard to raise enough money without without the government help because it's such a controversial issue, and people are not likely to invest because they're going to save the pandas instead. Ladies and gentlemen, the people who are likely to invest in medical research and in the medical industry are not the same people who are going to who are going to look at the pamphlet about saving the pandas and to try to decide between the two, right? There's a huge amount of investors who are dedicated to specifically this type of research. So first of all, we say this is not necessarily a charity. It's not necessarily research money or grant money. This is an investment in medical research that is quite likely to yield profits. And so a lot of this research is going to be going on in a for profit type environment and is going to lead to so you're gonna get like medical companies and pharmaceutical companies that are going to be doing this research, under government regulations, so that they don't pressure women into giving up their embryos. But that's the kind of thing where people are likely to invest, because there's going to be high yield profits at the end. Second of all, we think that there are huge amounts of money donated specifically to the type of science and medicine that is controversial, because there are people who who are very much in favor of showing everyone just how important this research is and can be. So let's move on, right. Like when should the free market be allowed like we say, excuse me, let me just say the free market should be allowed to pursue this kind of research. But, the question here is can we use tax money on such highly controversial research, and we say you cannot. When should we use tax money to subsidize programs or services or research? One, if everyone in society agrees that it makes sense. So, for example, in most societies there's a general consensus that every child has a right to education, so we fund in some ways the elementary and high school education. Two, if there is a dire need for something and the private market can adequately fill that need. So, for example, in most societies healthcare is subsidized in some way, because it can't because the totally private market can't provide services for everyone. So even in the united states before obamacare, you at least have medicare and medicaid for those most in need. But here the private sector his huge incentives to work on this research. We don't know exactly what we'll get from it but the prediction is that it will vastly improve medicine and science, and so the outcomes are going to be profitable. So since so many people are opposed on religious and moral grounds to this research, and since it has funding anyways, the government should not use our tax money against our will. Thank you.
We should not abandon television. In this debate the government side says that we should shift our resources to streaming services rather than traditional over the air or cable or satellite television. We think that this creates a dramatically false dichotomy that doesn't actually recognize how streaming services have become so successful. We think that the reason that streaming services like netflix, like hulu have become so widespread and so accepted is not because the streaming itself is useful but because they provided access to high quality content that was produced on television in things that you wouldn't have gotten without television existing for example, the most viewed television or the most viewed programs on netflix are not netflix original series they're parks and recreation, they're the office they're the walking dead, they're things that wouldn't have been able to exist without the large amount of funding that comes from traditional television networks. The first argument they make directly is that consumers have more choice in that streaming provides infinite access to whatever you want but this again doesn't recognize the issue that I highlighted just now that if you get rid of television, that if you don't have these networks that have deep pockets, that have a wide audience, then you're not going to be able to provide as much content as there otherwise would be. Netflix doesn't have infinite money to fill their catalog with only netflix created content so they need to subsidize themselves with traditional television. The same goes for hulu. Streaming services would fall off a cliff if you didn't have traditional television. We think you would have worse quality content and we think that people benefit from having the ability to consume mainstream media and the ability to consume networks like NBC and CBS that have the money to spend on content because they just have a broad a broad reach. We also think that the idea of more choices is just not true. There are hundreds of television networks that you can access through your cable provider and so we just don't think that this is actually a big issue. The second thing that they bring up is niche programing in that you can maximize your ROI of niche content when you're on streaming services and that you get more diverse creators because you don't need as much buy-in from like a network let's say and so again first, TV is not exclusionary a screening. You can have both in our world where as the government world only has streaming. But the benefit of the benefit of TV is maybe you do get more diverse creators streaming online but you can also get is big television networks picking up successful niche content and putting it on their network which spreads the reach of those programs to more people which means you get more exposure and again this is not exclusionary of streaming, it's just one way that television can help expand the outreach and the and the impact of these diverse creators. The final thing he talks about is that streaming is just less expensive. There's high upkeep costs for television providers. Look television is still immensely profitable. ESPN despite how expensive the government team lays it out, is still a profitable business and and is able to get more people streaming because of their television access. We think that streaming and television go hand in hand and to say that we should just abandon television we think doesn't recognize the quality increase that you get in streaming in all other forms of media because of the traditional television model that we have today and for these reasons we should not abandon television.
So, side government chose to set this debate up from the perspective of the third world countries, which we aren't certain that it's entirely fair play, but we'll go along. So the first point they make is the loss of human capital. And this is kind of an odd point. First of all because this is really not a like big enough phenomenon to really be impactful, especially since these countries often suffer problems of overpopulation. So it's a little strange to say that they must insist on a few extra thousand children, at best, remaining in the country. Moreover, the children that are getting adopted are at the very least just as likely to become poor and sick rather than a healthy educated worker. That's why they are being adopted in the first place, right? It's a charity. So, in this regard, international adoption actually does these countries a favor. This logic also applies to the point about like adopting babies for that come from an ethnic minority group because as long as these babies, as horrible as this may sound, are more likely to to become a liability or a burden on this community, then this entire talk about human capital is irrelevant. I'm sorry if this may seem too cynical an approach. I am merely responding to side government that has brought the, you know, the other side of the same coin. Second point they make is about how this this turns those babies into a commodity. They tell us that businesses are are are like starting to specialize in international adoption, and then they don't treat these children as individuals but merely the source for income. So firstly, I'm not like I'm not sure if the previous speaker notices just how ironic this claim sounds right after he argues that we should keep these children in the third world, because they can be used to benefit the economy. But like let's put this tension aside for a minute. It's just unclear to me how you can seriously argue against international adoption from the angle of what's best for the child himself. Is the adoption procedure easy and uncomfortable? Of course it isn't. It never is. But the government never bothers to actually talk about the comparative, which is to force them to remain in extreme poverty conditions. They talk about how many children might be sent back. I don't know why that's true, that's something that needs like statistical testing but like in any case, this is, at best, criticism that is aimed against the method in which this procedure is being handled and not the principle itself of international adoption. We are not against, for instance, making sure that the parents will have to fly over and meet the child before the adoption, for that matter. And lastly, the government finally talks about what we believe to be the this the main clash in this debate, and that is the comparison with other local orphaned children. So they tell us that people want to adopt babies and not like grown children, and that is why they turn to international adoption. So I'm really uncertain that this is really why people do this, and not because, for instance, people are just interested in doing an a kind act, perhaps the kindest there is, and save the life of a of a child that otherwise would have been sentenced to pretty miserable conditions. But if we assume that side government is right, then it's entirely unclear from their analysis why does this preference not to adopt older children will go away after we prohibit the international option. This like this can just as likely say that we simply like that simply less people will opt for adoption, which means more orphaned children in the world that never get to have a family, and that is terrible. Please oppose this unreasonably unjust motion.
We should not end mandatory retirement. So something that I think is missing from sam's speech is context about where and when we see mandatory retirement. One country where mandatory retirement is pretty common is germany, where there are different mandatory retirement ages for different professions, and those ages are set with a lot of input from unions or professional groups that represent employees from that profession. So it's not just something being set by government. And this isn't something being done arbitrarily by dictatorships either, it's common in a lot of central european countries. So our first argument is that mandatory retirement is fundamentally fair. I think this is really the crux of all of sam's arguments: it's his perception that it's unfair to make people stop working. But I think that it's obvious that this is a more complex issues than that when you consider that one person's employment denies someone else the ability to hold that position. We would argue that mandatory retirement is important to help young people have the opportunity to work. One of the effects of the vastly better medical technology we have today than a century ago is that people can continue working well into their seventies, but as a result that means that fewer new opportunities open up for young people to enter into professions. This means that for a lot of professions, such as the professoriate, there are very few opportunities for young people to get involved, and this means that there's less and less new blood coming into those professions as the same people can keep a stranglehold on ideas and the way that work is done for long periods of time. We think that mandatory retirement is fair because it prevents one generation or one group from monopolizing a profession. We think it's important that new ideas and new people be allowed to enter into these professions, and we'd argue that no one has a right to work for as long as they want. Where would that right come from? Plainly not from convention since in many countries, like germany, this is something that's been done for centuries under many different types of government. We also think that there's an important distinction between younger and older workers, because older workers have had time to make provision for their retirement. For instance, in many countries, like germany, they'll have a pension. They've had an opportunity to make savings, to buy a house, to provide for their family and all of these things that younger workers haven't been able to do yet. So we think that we should defer to helping out younger workers who are financially worse off rather than older workers who have had time to save and are often kind of adding to the wealth they're going to have in retirement, rather than just meeting their needs. Under this, we'd also argue that age shouldn't be a protected class. Age is different than something like sex or race because everyone is going to go through every age in their life, at least, you know, assuming they don't have a premature death. We think that, for instance, current young people will one day be old and that current elderly people once benefited from these programs. It seems quite hypocritical for people who benefitted from mandatory retirement in order to begin their own careers to then pull out the rug under the young people of today because they don't want to retire. And lastly, we think that with input from different stakeholders, like unions and professional groups, that governments can set a fair age. If the retirement ages now are a bit too low in countries like germany or czechia, then they can be changed rather than abolished altogether. The second main point we would make is that this creates more of a norm of retirement. Many americans never plan to retire and will never have any sort of leisure time after the end of their childhood. When you have mandatory retirement and have an expectation that everyone retires at sixty five or sixty seven or whatever, this ensures that people do have that leisure time and don't spend their entire lives working, which we think gives them more time to spend with their families and with their loved ones rather than at their desk for their entire life. For all these reasons, we should not end mandatory retirement. Thank you.
We should not ban telemarketing. Contrary to what rachel has told you, we're going to explain why telemarketing is not fundamentally different from other types of marketing and why it shouldn't uniquely be banned. So, first, we tell you that this is no more abusive than other types of sales. We think that it's unfair for the government to target one type of business while they leave other types of business free to compete against these now handicapped companies. Rachel needs to explain to you why telemarketing is fundamentally different from door-to-door salesman, or from intrusive ads on television or the internet, or those little kiosks at shopping malls where people try to convince you to buy sunglasses or whatever. We think at the end of the day that there's not really any unique harm to telemarketing. It's just another way for businesses to put information and the opportunity to buy their goods out there to customers. We think that the reason why businesses spend so much money on telemarketing is that some people like to purchase things over the phone. After all, if it didn't work, businesses wouldn't spend money on it. So we think rachel needs to explain to you why this is uniquely pernicious. Our second argument is about why this isn't unnecessarily intrusive. And I think this is the most obvious way rachel could respond to our first argument, by saying that telemarketing is unique because it's so intrusive into our lives. I don't think that's really the case though. There may have been a time when because people had mostly landline phones without caller IDs, when you couldn't tell if telemarketers were your neighbors or salespeople. And there may have been a time when there was no way to avoid having your phone constantly ring and disturbing you at home because of telemarketers. But nowadays, fewer and fewer households have landline phones, and in many countries around the world, the rate is even lower than it is now in america. Most people now get most of their junk calls on their mobile phone. Why is this important? Well, I don't know about you, but if I get a call from someone I don't recognize on my cell phone, I don't answer it. In fact, my new phone actually tells me that a call is likely spam. But what's most important is that everyone's cell phones now have caller ID which shows that you're getting a call from a one eight hundred number or sometimes from a particular company. So you can see that you're getting a call from, I don't know, some marketing company or whatever, and you're able to tell that this isn't actually your grandma and you don't need to answer the phone. So I just don't think this is intrusive as rachel would need to make it out to be in order to go after this type of business. People make a choice to answer the phone to telemarketers. If people are being convinced to buy something over the phone, they're still responsible for that, because they made an active choice to purchase this good and an active choice to answer the phone in the first place. People don't need to be protected from persuasive marketing, they need to make better decisions. And rachel is unfairly punishing certain businesses when she proposes this model and trying to protect people from themselves, which we don't think is the role of government. And our final argument is that telemarketing makes products uniquely accessible to certain types of people. If, for instance, you have someone who's very elderly, and can't drive, and lives in an area where they can't walk anywhere, that person might have a hard time doing their shopping or finding access to goods, and telemarketers uniquely make them aware of what exists that's available for them. Most telemarketers aren't just throwing their goods out in the wind. They do research the people they're calling. So, for instance, you might have a company that sells goods for old people who are incontinent call an elderly person, and that might be the only way that these elderly people are able to get access to these goods. We think that there are other groups of people too, like disabled people, who also have less mobility and might need access to goods over the phone. So we think that telemarketing actually serves a market that is under wise otherwise underserved and therefore that this is something uniquely good in society. For all these reasons, we should not ban telemarketing. Thank you.
We should not introduce goal-line technology. In this round we're going to go through the arguments presented by the government's side and explain why we don't think that they are realistic and why they don't justify goal-line technology and then we're going to explain some of the trade-offs that goal-line technology presents. The first argument that the government team makes is that goal-line technology would make football more fair and that fans need to perceive the game is fair otherwise they're going to turn away from football and they're not going to be spending their money on it which is bad obviously for the sport as a whole. But we just don't think that this is a major issue in the status quo and we think the government's side severely over-blows the impact of perceptions of unfairness in football. In fact the government side even acknowledges this later in their speech when they say " well sports rigging isn't a big issue in football nor other sports " and that's exactly the case. This just isn't a major issue in the status quo and because of that we don't think that this needs to be implemented for a perception of fairness. They say that that the goal-line technology can objectively measure the accuracy of a goal better than refs but recognize that the vast majority of goals scored in a football game are obvious, they're incredibly clear, the ball goes into the back of the net, it clearly breaks the plane. This would probably apply to less than one percent of goals that would be scored in football and because of that, we just don't think that this idea of objective measurement actually plays out in a in a particular perception of football being more fair. Finally, they say that more fans will watch football if it's perceived as more fair. A few responses to this: first, football viewership is already rising, it's already becoming more popular in places like china and the united states areas that have massive markets to tap into but haven't been particularly big into football in the past. Secondly, we don't think that this minute change to how the game works is going to be a tipping point in whether or not someone starts watching football. The the government team argues this a few times that this will create some sort of growth in viewership but if I'm a person that isn't already watching football, this change is not going to be the tipping point that decides whether or not I get into it. It's this it's the personalities of the players, it's the performance on the pitch, it's those types of things the actual beauty of the game and the thrill of the competition that get someone to watch a sport not this minute change to the rules that affects a very limited amount of plays. Their second argument is that this creates accountability for officials and that you need to prevent match fixing which is when they acknowledge that match fixing is not actually a big deal. But recognize that even if match fixing were a big problem because the because of the fact that goals are almost always clear cut, we think that when match fixing actually occurs it occurs in the case of penalty calls rather than goal scoring itself and so if match fixing were to be a problem, we don't think that goal-line technology would actually address it in any sort of meaningful way because all the technology isn't going to overturn whether or not a red card get sent out. The final argument they make is about international sporting norms in that there's an expectation of sport that it's fair and subjective. It's really just a repetition of the first point. So cross apply all of the arguments that I made already that this just isn't a major issue in the status quo, that this is a minute issue, but we also think that there's a an a degree of fun that is added to a fan base. There's a degree of community that is added. Even if a referee gets something wrong that brings the community of the sport, it allows them to rally around that, allows them to celebrate something or demonized something but it makes the community stronger and that's will ultimately what's keeps fans interested. For these reasons, we should not introduce goal-line technology.
Don't ban racial profiling. Look we agree with pretty much everything that danny says about this being a bad action, but this doesn't mean that a ban is the best way to enforce them. Things like racial profiling are bred from internal biases that are incredibly difficult to catch as like an outside individual and even more difficult to prove in any kind of formal setting because there can be a million excuses that you can come up with that would sound perfectly valid for why something wasn't racial profiling. Proving that someone got stopped only on the basis of racial profiling is near impossible at the point that can someone can say no here were the suspicious actions I thought they were taking, here's like maybe the context for the situation. So we think this is just very difficult to isolate and although it is certain some certainly something that happens and certainly something that is bad, we don't think that the correct method of stopping it would be to ban it. Especially since we live in a society that is slowly becoming less racist and slowly becoming more liberal and beginning to recognize in a self aware manner that these about actions we think that banning could actually take us back. Two main arguments, first on why it's impossible to ban. No police department, no university, no institution of authority ever has a policy that directly advocates for racial profiling because everybody knows that it's problematic and racist and looked down upon it's simply that they also have justifications in their head for why what they're doing isn't wrong or doesn't actually count as racial profiling. Especially when someone can often not even pick out those biases that cause them to make the decision themselves, that they don't notice that they're stopping black people at a vastly higher rate than white people. They don't notice that they're more likely to shoot a black person than a white person. These are all things that happen in the moment instinctive biases that influence actions in especially pernicious ways but aren't very like shown off at all. So racial profiling is often done unknowingly by individuals who are otherwise decent people but have deeply ingrained biases that influence their actions. And as such it's impossible to prove when racial profiling actually occurs because no one says hey I'm going to commit some racial profiling today, there's no way to prove this in a court of law because it just end up being the victims were the attacker. We already have laws against racial discrimination so the situations where racism can be completely codified and can be isolated from other impulses are already taken care of. It's bad to have an impossible ban because you just teach people to hide their problematic behavior better and you're making massive amounts of backlash from people that are worried that this will be weaponized against them. Like republicans, the police, university cops even, like any group that feels like they could get in trouble for racial profiling is now just going to get especially defensive and especially try to avoid these things. But they're not actually going to change whether or not they're racist people right? Like the response to this won't be things like sensitivity training, rather it'll be like actively training on this is a bad policy it's useless but you don't want to be a victim of it. Which brings us to our second argument, which is that banning racial profiling just leaves actually just makes all of racism and like the situation between police and people of color especially worse. Claims of discrimination first will just get less weight in court. Police are going to come up with better excuses, they'll say that because they know it's illegal they have training and policies against it and they'll use that as a reason for why they're good police officer could never have been a racist. And judges are also just much more likely to empathize with policemen the way they often do in the status quo when it comes to police brutality cases, which means you'll get even fewer convictions because they're also kind of binding together in order to make sure that no one gets in trouble. Police are also just going to learn to work around this. Like this might mean avoiding areas with high prevalence minority groups so doing any policing there at all which we think is bad arm but it also it's just going to mean they're going to work harder to defend each other from these kinds of claims, it propagates the idea that police are being unfairly targeted, and they're going to respond by trying to hide even more. Proud to oppose.
I'm going to start by refuting the points of the previous speaker and then I'll add another argument, which is the implications that this proposition is going to have on the jewish community and the huge backlash that this is going to definitely cause. So, side government tell us that the problem with male circumcision is that it's being imposed on infants and it's irreversible. They talk about body autonomy and they say that people should be able to choose what to do with their bodies because they are the ones that will have to live with this decision, and they know best how it affects them, and parents don't have a right to choose. We would like to challenge this assumption and ask: well, what about vaccinations, for instance? Should we also wait for eighteen? And, in general, we think that there are a lot of things also, beside bodily autonomy, but there are a lot of things that parents get to decide over you which will have a huge impact on your life, and you don't have a say in the matter. What's your name, what sort of education you're going to get and so on, and as a part of this, they are also, in a sense, choosing for you which community you are born into and in some cases, cases this comes with circumcision. Now, we'd like to mention that very few people end up regretting the fact that they've been circumcised, even if they choose to opt out of their religions. The fact that people keep doing this from generation to generation, and most people choose to also circumcise their sons as well, just shows how most people don't don't end up suffering from that decision, even if it was forced upon them. So and then they say that like it forces people to bear the mark of their religion that they might opt out of. Well, it's not really really relevant today when like well over fifty percent of the population are being circumcised anyway, whether by choice or not. Then we hear that it's just genital mutilation and that it's arbitrary to oppose it in the in the case of female mutilation and not of male circumcision. So, I'm not going to actually defend the logic behind circumcision. Of course, this is a random custom that has become a tradition. But it is very different from female mutilation simply because in that case, it is about a harm that goes way beyond aesthetics. In the cases of female mutilation, the like purpose of this ritual is to deny women the ability to enjoy intercourse. This is just another historical way for the male hegemony to oppress women, whereas in in circumcision, we don't have that effect or any long-term damages that we can seriously speak of. The fact is, as the previous speaker acknowledges, that many non-jewish men also choose to get circumcised now. I don't think that the equivalent happens with with women as well, and this testifies to how there is no real long-term damage here. So, finally, after we heard a lot of theoretical talk about like principles and autonomy, we think that it that it it's worth asking how are the implications of this proposition are going to actually look like in reality. It's important to understand that this custom is one of the core tenants of judaism. It symbolizes for us the pact that abraham has made with god, and such a ban will undoubtedly be seen as a declaration of war, an antisemitic act from the state against the jewish community. And we should mention this is a community that, given its history, is understandably sensitive to attacks against it. So, we think that what inevitably is going to happen as a result is a backlash effect, where rabbis will preach to their communities not to listen to the laws of the state. People will become more extreme in their religious zealous, and not only is that never a good thing for the state or for society, this will only bring to more young ones in these communities enjoying far less of their rights and their autonomies, and that's exactly what side government set out to prevent to begin with. Living in a successful multicultural society means that we have to know what fights we want to pick and where we need to choose to stay out and compromise. Please oppose.
In this speech I'm going to talk about two reasons why we think that it's crucial that we keep on having child actors in show business. The first being like just literally that we need children to play roles of children in movies and TV shows and plays etcetera. And the second is on child actors becoming role models for children. But before all of that, let's address what daniel has brought to this debate. So first he talks a great deal about how there is no consent in child acting. To which we say yeah, like a thousand and one different things in your childhood that you didn't consent to. Did you really consent fully go to school? No. Did you really consent to go to like piano lessons that your mom insisted that you go to or to the judo lessons that your dad insisted that you go to? No. Now say that there's a there's a kid that really wants to go to you know a football class because he dreams of becoming a football a football star. He probably doesn't fully realize or understand all of the meaning of what it means to be like a football star. But he might actually prove successful. So according to government's logic we ought not let him play. In both these cases this is something like this is a hobbit or something that takes a huge portion of your time if you do it seriously. In both of these cases there could be pressure from the side of the parents. So what is the difference? Then they tell us that it's hard to enforce regulation. And we just couldn't understand why because all that daniel said, is basically that producers find ways to bypass regulation. Fine. But that problem exists literally everywhere in the market. There's nothing unique here. If it bothers us so much, we just need to enforce harder. And lastly they talk about the potential damages of like stress and social social seclusion. To which we say fine, we accept that there might be problems but these harms exist in both worlds. Why? Because under government's world children are still going to want to be famous. And today society has changed. There's social media, there's social networks and it's impossible to stop someone from posting, you know, videos on youtube and becoming a sensation overnight. Pewdiepie would be a good example to that. This means that we can no longer really contain our children in a safe innocent environment, you know, safe from all the dangers out there in the real world. Because they will always know how to bypass these protections and get out there way better than we do. Necessarily. So moving on to the constructive and the importance of having child performers. So let's just understand for a second and appreciate the fact that under government's world there are no longer children that take part in movies, in plays, in TV shows. Think about it for a second. This is a drastic change that will require a very complicated adjustment for all of our cultural institutions. This means that if we would have wanted to now do a you know movie version to the harry potter saga, then we had to do it animated, or we had to take adults that will play children. And both of these options are far less appealing because they are far less realistic or credible. So in the bottom line we say that show business is just different from all of the other fields in that he desperately like this is a field that desperately needs children. There is no virtue in employing children children in the police force, or in restaurants, or in banks or supermarkets. But society does need child actors. And that's why in this case we make an exception and we let children work. Beyond that we say that there's another reason why we think it's important to preserve real children that will act in in movies and that is to create role models for younger children. Movie stars and TV stars are the heroes of your childhood. And it's just impossible to create the same type of connection with an adult because he's not like you. He doesn't go through the same phases and the same things and the same problems that you go through. And you cannot imagine yourself in his shoes as a child. Not to mention like if it would have been a cartoon right? So we think that characters like harry potter, and that's just one example of many, are an inspiration of a totally different sort for children. And losing this means taking away a big part of their childhood. So for all of these reasons please oppose this motion.
Don't increase the fuel tax. Two main arguments, first on the way this restricts necessary actions by the average individual. Recognize that transportation, things like heating and lighting and keeping water in your home, essentially basically every behavior that is necessary to sustain life within a house environment is dependent on fossil fuels. And this has nothing to do with the choices that individuals make, but rather what the choices that are available to them. Because it's not true that there's often companies that can provide green energy in specific areas and it is not the case that people have control over this the majority of the time. So what are we talking about here? For transportation people who don't own cars. And recognize that or recognize that people don't own cars just for fun. They do it because most people live outside of city centers and have no way to get to work, the grocery store, or anywhere without a car. Like driving your kids to school becomes impossible. People who don't need a car usually don't own one anyway because it is an unnecessary expenditure and takes up a lot of space and usually if you're living in an urban center it also gets taxed by way of having to be kept in a garage so you're also paying for parking. What this means is that we're literally talking about people whose livelihoods are at risk once they can no longer afford gas, which is very problematic because the alternatives are also ridiculously pricey. Like electric cars are still experimental technology and are incredibly expensive in the status quo. So once you do things like increase the fuel tax, you're making people unable to afford like the basic necessity gas cars that they have right now but you're not actually making green energy cars more affordable for them. And given that there's a fairly large expense gap between the two, people are just left without anything. And then with heating and lighting and keeping your house in the winter this is also very important right? Like if all of our house functions that keep us protected from the environment are electricity or gas dependent, you probably shouldn't be raising the amount that they cost because then individuals who are already on the border or in poverty won't be able to afford them anymore. And we need people to be able to stay warm in the winter, to be able to cook their food. Like their children need to be able to eat and do homework and not get hypothermia. This is really important like just for your day to day existence and we think it's much more important than the marginal impact that the average person might have on global warming which we're also just going to address more later on. Like james needs to recognize that he is literally screwing with peoples' ability to live by putting a price tag on the stuff they need to facilitate life, and that this especially falls on individuals who are poor. Our second argument is about this is why why this is an incorrect burden. Sure it is bad that individuals are contributing marginally to climate change but their contribution is nothing compared to massive corporations that are mass producing, dumping waste, and using inefficient fuel sources for much larger projects. Moreover james doesn't actually create an incentive for pre-existing companies to change their actions because it's the consumer who's paying the tax not corporations. The problem is availability of competitive energy sources. Most areas only have gas and oil companies so people will still have to pay for the fossil fuels, they're just going to have to pay more. He can't prove that the tax money is going to green energy. Much more likely it's just going to the military or public safety nets and healthcare, so it's more important to make sure that people can afford to heat their homes in the winter and get to work so that they can live. Moreover we just think that more effective policies would be ones that actually targeted corporations rather than individuals. So maybe taxes on emissions or taxes on the size of a corporation or their environmental impacts or perhaps we would just appreciate subsidies for green energy companies. Like there are literally a million ways to implement these kinds of things that get the best impacts that james wants without unnecessarily harming innocent individuals who are just trying to live. Proud to oppose.
I'll be honest. I don't see any way in which I could seriously argue that global warming isn't a threat. Of course it is. There's a scientific consensus. All the evidence points out that it's actually there, it's happening and as a result, all of the bad things that the previous speaker mentioned, they're simply true, you know, the info slide says that much. So, there's no real point in arguing here. This is why in order to make the subject more interesting or debatable, I'm going to cheat a little bit and play with the meaning of how this motion can be understood. This might not be the fairest way to go. I am truly sorry, I just don't know what else I could say in response to what has already been said, without bluntly lying or denying facts. So the way that I choose to interpret this motion is whether the threat of global warming is such that justifies all of the actions that countries are, you know, that countries are taking, all the steps that countries are taking and that international organizations are taking today that are meant to, you know, fight global warming. And here, there's already a bit of a room to oppose. Such measures include mostly quotas on missions and heavy fines for countries that exceed their quota. We are going to oppose these measures on two grounds. Firstly, we're going to say that they are unfair and unjust. And secondly, we're going to say that they're inefficient. So, why are they unfair? The reason that these measures are unfair is that, like any other decision that is set by international like the big international institutes like the UN, is that these this decisions are skewed in favor of the strong countries that de facto control these institutions, namely, the united states, and against countries like china, for instance. These are decisions that under the disguise of environmental decisions are actually meant to preserve the existing global order and the united states' strength as a global superpower. How does this bias look like? We say that industrial countries, like china, are required to to to adhere to far stricter standards and the enforcement upon them is much stricter than other countries. This is how the united states is able to block the advancement the industrial advancement of china that is a major threat to its global hegemony. So that's that. Now let's explain why they are inefficient. By this we mean that there is a better alternative and that is, funny as it may sound, just wait and do nothing for now. Why is that better? Because we must remember that the damage the foreseen damage from climate change will only come years into the future, not tomorrow morning. This might seem like an irrelevant fact, but this is a game changer. Why? Because what daniel leaves out of the equation when he lists the potential harms and costs of dealing with global warming in the future is that the human kind keeps becoming more and more rich and more and more advanced in a rapid pace. Now, it's possible, it's even likely, that in the near future we are going to come up with new technological ways to eradicate the threat of global warming altogether, which means that all of our previous efforts were basically meaningless. But even if not, we say that people and countries will become meaningfully richer by the time that we have to deal with the with all of these effects and , thus, better able to deal with the costs of like direct head-on solutions. But in order for that to actually happen, we must allow modernization to rush forward without limiting it, which is what happens today. Just like it's a wildly accepted economic fact that forcing austerity measures in a country that's in that's highly in debt, like greece, for instance, only speeds up the economic downfall of that country and causes it to default, and it would be better to just let the market evolve and do his own thing without intervention, and the solution will just present itself. We think that's analogous to the question of climate change in a global level. So, for all of these reasons, please oppose.
This has to be said in the loudest and clearest way possible. In side government's world, I can innocently walk around in the schoolyard when, out of nowhere, the school bully comes up to me and starts shoving me around, and by simply trying to defend myself and shoving him back, it just so happens, of course, that the teacher is just passing by, and now I am facing suspension, without being given the slightest opportunity to state my case. This is what they call fair. This is absurd. The first argument that we hear from the previous speaker is that other forms of punishments are probably going to be random and even discriminatory, because they will be based on teachers' or principals' assessments, and they tend to blame black children more than they do white children. So, first of all, I am really not convinced that this is true, such a blunt and easily visible form of racism sounds a bit extreme to me. But, let's say that it is true. If it truly is the matter, then surely no tolerance policy will only make things worse because when this is all or nothing, with suspension or expulsion at stake, it is very likely that teachers that tends to favor certain children over others to such an extent will simply turn a blind eye to cases that are less convenient for them and will only go through with punishments in cases that are more convenient, meaning for every fight that breaks between white pupils, according to james's logic, the teachers or the principal will find ways to overlook the entire thing, as if it didn't happen, but with black pupils, it's going to be immediate, uncompromising expulsion. Secondly, he says something about now, because there is no way to exercise judgment, then the punishments will become less severe, you know, with the example of writing on the on the blackboard a hundred times, like bart simpson. This is odd because obviously this completely contradicts the next argument that deals with deterrence. It is very simple: sometimes we need harsh punishments. We simply need to, you know, exercise judgment while we use those punishments, so less cases of unjust punishments will occur. Then james talks about how punishments in the status quo aren't deterring enough to the, you know, cunning children that know that they can rely on their charm to get out of trouble. And I think that it's just very seldom the case that it is particularly the children that cause so much trouble that are the charming kids that the teachers admire, like james describes. Let's not be naive. The teachers spend hours each day with the children, and they are not idiots. They know exactly who are the violent or problematic kids and who are the, you know, more nerdy children that will never hurt a fly. They are also quite capable of talking things over with the children involved and understanding exactly who needs to be blamed. These usually aren't exactly the toughest cases in the world to crack. So we needn't insult the intelligence of the teachers that and say that they will so often be duped by their pupils. So, yes, very rarely naughty children might walk away from punishments. Fine. For such a thing, do we really need such a drastic measure of punishing everyone who is somehow involved automatically, without allowing anyone to defend himself or explain himself? Obviously, this way we're going to get a lot more injustice. And lastly, james tells us that this is this way we can remove the troublemakers, and this would be better for all the good students that are harmed by this. No, I'm sorry, this is off-clash. Problematic pupils need to be removed and suspended, but if they are truly so mischievious and they are truly causing eighty percent of the problems, as james says, then even after exercising judgment, we can still take care of them appropriately. There is no good reason here to mask our eyes and shut our ears and skip the part where we try and understand exactly what happened and whose fault this is. Clearly you should oppose.
So the huge problem that side government has with personality tests is that they are not one hundred percent accurate tools in predicting a person's success in a new job, and this is why they seek to abolish them. But please note that according to this logic, we would also have to abolish standardized tests as a whole, personal interviews, CVs, personal references and recommendations. All of these things are just as inaccurate or incapable of predicting one's chances of thriving in a future work environment. Why is this true? It's true because all of these things suffer from the exact same problems that tim mentions regarding personality tests. Please note: it is true what tim says that people's personalities are complex things that are impossible to sum up in one test, and it is just as hard to sum it up in one or two interviews or in a CV or in a diploma. It is also true that, as team tells us, that these tests are very affected from one's mood. But so are work interviews. It is also true that people's personalities can change and fluctuate and therefore, literally any type of indication that we might have on the current personality traits of a person sitting in front of us is not necessarily truly indicative of the future. All of these things lead to fateful decisions being taken based on partial indications and can result in errors and can meaningfully harm someone's self-confidence or whatever, practically all of the other harms laid out by tim in his speech. But if we abolish all of these, then we would be left with no information whatsoever. So it's really quite simple. Some information, even if partial, is always preferable to less information. If the purpose of side government in this debate is truly to minimize the amount of randomness and to minimize the errors in judgment while accepting people to a new job place or to a college degree, then they have to support the exact opposite position. Look, no tool is perfect. We can never know for sure. So the best way to go is to try and gather as many indications and as many, you know, as much information as we can, and personality tests help in doing that. Tim assumes for a certain reason, but never analyzes that these tests are somehow mutually exclusive to things like references and recommendations or personal interviews or other filtering tools. But this is not true. They are not mutually exclusive. We don't think that there are really a lot of managers that truly believe that these tests have the power of prophecy with absolute accuracy and they count on them blindly. People are fully aware to all of the hardships that tim has brought up in his speech. It doesn't take a genius to think of that, sorry. So, it's just nothing more but another tool that provides some additional insight that may prove useful in some cases. Maybe the results of this test can be, you know, a tiebreaker between two candidates that have good credentials and it was hard to decide between them. We have no problem with this scenario. So to sum it all up, we think that we haven't truly heard a serious case for the abolition of these tests. Obviously, they are not a hundred percent accurate. It's not magic, but you know what? It's something. Please oppose to this motion.
We should not adopt teacher tenure reform. So the first thing that we want to do before we get into any of the government's arguments is that we want to contradict the characterization of tenure in the status quo that the government presents. They say that it's just gross misconduct that can get teachers fired once they have tenure but it's not as extreme as the government makes it out to be. If the teacher is literally sitting there and not doing a single thing, that can be counted as gross misconduct and that can get a teacher removed. We think that the school also has many other options to push a teacher out like starting to take their classes away or giving them more difficult coursework or or a number of other things that can make teachers want to leave even if they have tenure. But disregarding that, we think that the vast majority of teachers that get into teaching want to do so because they want to work with kids, they want to help these kids. Recognize that even if you're a teacher at a school for fifty or forty years, you're still not making a very high salary and your lifetime earning potential is just higher in other fields that someone with a college degree can get. Like every teacher has to have this college degree and so there are other more lucrative fields for them to go into and so we think that these people are often not making purely financial decisions. So the first argument they make is that removing tenure aligns incentives of teachers with society and the status where the status quo many don't have to care about the success of their students but for the reasons I just outlined we think that the people that ultimately go into education are those that are going to be most likely to care about their students and while it's certainly true everyone has had that teacher that just told them to open the book, read the lessons and didn't do much for them learning, we think that the vast majority of cases are cases in which teachers are actively trying to help their students and we think that the issue with getting rid of teacher tenure is that being a teacher especially in the united states, where we think this debate is mainly being talked about, teachers are dramatically undervalued by society. There are so many disincentives to becoming a teacher in the status quo. Aside from just the financial disincentives, there's also the fact that they have to work long hours, they have to they oftentimes have to take a second job because of the low salary. We think that tenure is the way that you incentivize quality applicants to go into the field of education. We think that if you remove tenure and you remove the stability which is one of the big arguments for going into education, then you're probably going to get even fewer people wanting to go into education which ultimately degrades the quality of the people that are teaching. So maybe it's true that if you get rid of tenure you can fire a couple more teachers that aren't doing their job well but we think the trade-off of that is that teachers that would have been more qualified see the fact that they can now be fired if students don't perform which often times is not the fault of the teachers. We've all been in school classes where kids just refuse to learn and that's not the teachers fault but they can now be fired because of having a handful of problem students on their hands and it suddenly becomes even more dangerous to go into teaching as a profession and we think ultimately the trade-off is you get fewer qualified teachers entering even if you can remove some people that shouldn't be there. The final argument they make is that this improves the finances of schools and you're able to hire more effective teachers and that this fills the gaps in the education system. But we think that for the reasons we have outlined above, you're going to ultimately get a net loss in qualified teachers because of the harms of going into education and because tenure is a is one of the big incentives for doing so. We think that there's other ways that you can make teachers that have been in schools for a long time more effective such as giving them continual training, by bringing in aids, by allowing them to go to school at night to do other things, to learn online. There's many resources to improve the quality of existing teachers. So we don't think that this is ultimately outweighing the harms of removing tenure. For these reasons, we should not adopt teacher tenure reform.
We should not subsidize investigative journalism. So before we get into the arguments that the government side makes, we want to give a brief overview about the kind of the principle we want to sustain throughout the round and we think that it's important to recognize that a subsidy creates a dependence. When you have a subsidized form of income, when you have money in budgets that depends on a subsidy that you are receiving when you do something like hire an extra journalist because you have this subsidy, it means that you become dependent on that subsidy in some way and this means that you are beholden to those that are granting you the subsidy. We think that this creates a conflict of interest in which it shields those that are most that are most in need of monitoring. When the government is giving you a subsidy for your investigative journalism we think it makes it more difficult for you to investigate those that are in power that are providing that subsidy and because of that, we think we would rather have a system in which there may be less investigative journalism but when you know there's no conflict of interest. The first argument that the government side makes is that this is a public service and because it's a public service this should be given there should be some sort of subsidy provided to this and they give examples like cable and water services how they can be private but still get public subsidies. We think that this is unique uniquely needs to be separate from public institutions. We don't think that this is comparable to a cable provider or a water provider because there's no conflict of interest with a water provider getting money from the government like there is in the case of investigative journalism and because of that we don't think that the examples the government side gives are comparable. They say that it's not a conflict of interest is the only real response we get to the argument that we're making. It's not a conflict of interest because you're beholden to your company as a journalist and you can use private funds. We think that this is entirely naive. Once you start getting income from an outside source, we think the company especially in journalism an industry that is currently struggling for not just small journalism institutions but also big ones like the washington post and the new york times these are struggling institutions and we think that once they get a subsidy that allows them to keep their lights on, that allows them to function at a a at cost, we think that they're going to be entirely beholden on these and just because journalists are beholden to their to their company this doesn't mean that it's going to prevent a sort of conflict of interest because the company is the one that's getting the subsidy. The second argument they make is that this fights the super rich and that people like rupert murdoch control too much media and you need an alternative source of funding. This completely contradicts the point they just made about how because you're beholden to your company you won't have you won't have to you don't have to worry about a conflict of interest because rupert murdoch is the company. You're giving the subsidy to rupert murdoch and to his company. So giving a subsidy doesn't fight the super rich in any way. It just means that you're giving them a subsidy when they continue to spit out the propaganda that government side is so concerned with. They say the government acts on a public interest and therefore the government should be able to act in this way. This is fine but we don't think that this stops the other issues that we brought up in the round such as the conflict of interest and the and the issue that government brings up which is that you're giving more money to those that are in power like rupert murdoch. The final argument they make is that this is consistent with other subsidies like the BBC and they give the BBC as an example of how this can be done successfully. We're not against all forms of public journalism like we're fine with PBS and the likes existing, but we think that when you have private institutions you should keep them private, you should keep them separate from the government because of the issues of conflict of interest that we brought up already and we think that it's crucial that you have those private sector divide as it exists in the status quo. For these reasons, we should not subsidize investigative journalism.
There is a good reason that only citizens of the united states get a right to elect a president and that we don't just open up the election to whoever wishes to cast a vote and voice an opinion all over the world. That is something that we assume that side government agrees with and note that it is true, despite the fact that the question of who becomes president of the united states without a doubt affects many other people who are not american citizens. In the exact same way, we say that allowing people from outside a party to affect who is going to become that party's leader harms the right of the actual constituents for a proper representation and, in addition, it is going to have the exact opposite effect from what government wishes to achieve. Pay attention to what eitan says in his speech. He starts by explaining that the situation in the country today is worse than it has ever been in terms of the partisan rift between democrats and republicans. And we agree. He points to radical candidates but we would emphasize that the popularity of such candidates only comes to teach us that the people themselves are way more divided than ever before. Right afterwards he says that in his opinion, open primaries can help solve that situation, but the huge problem in his analysis is that he simply assumes that when people vote for a candidate of the other party, you're going to vote to whoever whoever represents the ideological position that's closest to their own and the people are going to simply use that vote to screw over the other side. But in a situation where democrats and republicans hate each other's guts to the extent that to many democrats there is no such thing as a tolerable republican, and to many republicans there is no such thing as a democrat that we could live with. We say that the most probable thing that's going to happen is that I would like to use my vote in order to harm the other party and the best way for me to do that is to to give my vote to the worst possible candidate that I believe has the least chances of winning in the general election. Note that at this point, all of the analysis that comes from eitan on the incentives of people to elect the most moderate candidate completely reverse and who the people that gained the most out of it is the most radical, most bizarre candidates that no one ever dared imagine that they were relevant before. Now, they are they are starting to be a part of the game. Note also that even if we wanted to believe that people are nice, people are not going to use this opportunity to try and cheat, we have no way of knowing that the other side isn't going to do exactly that and therefore, the most rational thing for each side to do is precisely to try and screw over the other side so at least he won't get screwed twice. So, yes, in fact we have here a sort of a prisoner's dilemma that results in in in like, outcomes that are bad for everyone. So, we have both harmed the right of the party constituents to elect a candidate and a leader for their party that truly represents their values and we have also entered the game all of the very worst of candidates in complete opposition to what government actually wants to achieve. If the united states' politics is in bad shape today, we can only imagine what new lows this proposition is going to bring. Oppose this horrible motion.
Community service should not be mandatory. We think that whatever promises of utility the government side of this debate presents to you, it is fundamentally unjust to take someone and force them to labor without pay. Whether it will be good for the community overall or good for the government does not counteract the fact that you are fundamentally forcing people to do labor that they did not volunteer for, that they themselves gain no benefit for, that creates a tradeoff over what they could be doing that would be more valuable to them, and dictating how they can use their time. We think that the government exists not to force people to do things that it finds to be utile but rather to to create an apparatus of freedom that allows people to make choices for themselves in a meaningful way. We think that mandatory community service goes entirely against the purpose of the government and is a massive breach of what the government is certified to do by the people. The first argument the government side makes is that it would improve the way that people treat the environment and treat their community, because if people have to work to keep their environment and their community clean, they gain an appreciation for it. They take pride in it. They're less likely to do things like litter. First, this will never outweigh the fact that you are forcing in a country, say this was the united states, in a country of the united states forcing hundreds of millions of people to do hours of unpaid labor is not only an economic drain, but is tantamount to forcing slave labor onto people, which we think is unjust. But we also think for those reasons, it's equally possible that people feel resentment over the fact that they're being forced to do labor that they are not being compensated for. In addition, we also think that this probably removes jobs that people would actually be compensated for. Like if you have a force of, you know, an entire town that's forced to clean that town and do community work on that town, then a bunch of administrative jobs suddenly go away. Garbage collectors, sewage maintenance people, these types of people suddenly lose their jobs and it creates a market harm. And and it creates resentment both from those being forced to do the labor and those that can no longer do the labor, which we mean thinks this probably makes people less likely to feel a tie to their community and less likely to treat it well. The second argument is that this is just a public good because there are less expenses and more gain. Well, for all the reasons I just outlined, we don't think it's really a public good. It's maybe a government good because the government can spend less money but, ultimately, it means that that money is that they would have otherwise been using is just being extracted in the form of free labor from its citizenry, which is massively unjust. And we think that most of the the work that's being done by these community service areas can be done to actually create good, hard-paying jobs, which gets us to the third argument that they make: that something needs to replace mandatory military service ; that in times of mandatory military service, people were able to have something to do after college that gave them job experience, taught them lessons, all these types of things, and they need something else. But unlike the military, this is unpaid labor. If this argument if the debate that the government side presented was instead as was that the government should create more public sector jobs in order to employ people in the short term and that those public sector jobs would be in areas like environmental preservation and doing things to beautify and keep the community safe, we're all for that, because those are jobs that people can voluntarily take. But when you're forcing people to do unpaid labor, we don't think they're gaining nearly the benefits that military service ever provided, especially cause there's no pay. It doesn't create any sort of similar skills and because of this, we think people are just going to feel like they are wasting their time and doing something that they don't want to be doing. For these reasons, community service should not be mandatory.
Don't subsidize higher education. Look recognize that in the status quo we already have scholarships, public colleges, and other loan and grant opportunities that facilitate individuals being able to access higher education. This fulfills the obligation that tim talks about because it's not the case that people have a right to higher education at any university, even one that is particularly expensive or particularly elite, rather just that the state has to provide access to some form of higher education. Given that this is already occurring, we don't think he can win this round on that argument. All of the opportunities that tim lists can be accessed through a public, less prestigious university that anyone can access relatively easily in the status quo, even if they have to take some loans out which time says he's okay with anyway, right? Because the cost of your local state university often is no more than ten thousand per year and often times can be severely mitigated if you have extra need. Especially recognizing that you have a lot of need-blind universities that once you get in guarantee you're going to get everything you need to attend. This actually especially applies to plenty of elite universities like brown and other ivies who have the money to provide for that. With that, two mean arguments, first on accounting for actual need. There are plenty of wealthy families and individuals in this world who simply don't need anyone to subsidize their education because they can afford to pay for it by being like just from the income that they already have. We think that it would be especially problematic if we do things like subsidize that anyway because it means that the money that could have been used for other individuals who actually need it or for other social welfare programs is instead of going to individuals who are able to afford university education on their own without any additional aid. This is a literal misuse of government money because when people pay taxes they expect that money to be used for the common good, and paying for individuals who have the money to pay for themselves simply doesn't account for that. Moreover recognize that this is also the rationale behind things like progressive taxes. We recognize that rich people are able to pay more so they probably should. In the same way we probably shouldn't subsidize individuals who won't be harmed by having to pay for their college education just because that money can make a much bigger difference somewhere else. Also recognize that the status quo accounts for these kinds of differences. We have things like FASA and CSS profiles and need-blind universities that evaluate student financial situations and offer them grants and loans. We're also final discussing plans to extend that further, we just think it's bad to subsidize everybody's college education. Our second argument is about backlash. In order to fund something like this you have to raise taxes to fund it, especially with this particular subsidization which costs billions of dollars to implement in order to account for every single student in the US. This means a lot of people are going to be very angry about how much more money they're paying and when this happens people respond by going to the polls and electing individuals who are more extreme conservative leaders that won't passed similar policies in the future, but worst of all are likely to do a bunch of more harmful stuff on top of it. Because these are often people from the same groups that don't believe in abortions or don't want immigration to occur or like really other bad things like our anti-vaxxers. Like these are just correlating opinions of a lot of the time. So we think this is actually the most important thing in this kinds of debates, more important than anything that tim might have brought up, because these kinds of people create a less safe future in the long term. So as long as we're doing okay right now, we need to prioritize who's going to be in charge later because those people are going to make really important decisions. But this is also important in the context of tim's argument about why people become like state dependent because we actually think in the status quo we are already capable of alleviating individuals who would rely on the state through higher education because most people already have access. It is oftentimes other things that prevent them from being able to exercise that access and that would have to be fixed in other ways. Proud to oppose.
The counterfactual to this debate is one in which that child or fetus does not exist as a human being, therefore in order to measure whether prenatal diagnosis does more good than harm, what you need to do is look at two potential worlds: one in which that this child exists and is a son or daughter to his family with a disability, and one in which that family is without child. We're going to compare those two worlds, show why those are the two likely worlds, and explain why there's more happiness in the world with a disabled child than without a child. Before that, two points of refutation. One, he says it's better for the parents because it costs a lot of money and there's emotional harm. Imagine the following scenario. Two people, one has a regular home, nice, upkept etcetera. The other has a dingy old home that he inherited from his great great grandparents, and he always has to put more and more money into fixing the pipes and uprooting the backyard and getting rid of the mold. Now, surely this home costs him more and yet, countless examples of people end up staying in these homes, because they are emotionally connected to the investment put into these homes. We think the same is true for many parents. But wait, he'll say, some parents won't want this and they should get to choose. We'll talk in the first argument about why this is not a decision able to be made at the point at which it's being made. Secondly, he says it's better for the kids because it's difficult to be disabled. Note the comparative in this debate is literally death. So what he's saying is being disabled is worse than being dead. He's saying the life of disabled people is a life not worth living. We simply think that's both sad and untrue. Sure, their lives are somewhat more difficult than the lives of many people, even much more difficult for some of them. But certainly their lives have value and meaning. If not, we'd like to understand why he is fine with things like killing them, enslaving them etcetera, if their lives have absolutely no value. Let's talk about why parents can't make this decision rationally. The problem with being able to make a decision ahead of time, is that the data is skewed in favor of the dry scientific data of disease, versus the emotional data that can only be accrued once the child is born. Crucially, the emotional data is illogical data, meaning the emotional connection that you end up having with your child and with your investment in this child is pertinent to the amount of joy and happiness you feel based on this child. However, since you can only get that data later, we think it's skewed in a way that makes parents irrationally often choose to abort the fetus. Now let's take the comparative. So they'll say look, these people will simply have another child. We would note that mostly this thing is available via in vitro fertilization, a process that costs upwards of twenty thousand dollars, and often is available to people only once. Some rich people can try more than once, sure, but for most people this is not an alternative. Secondly, the experience of having to create and then abort a child based on a genetic disease, one that is likely to repeat itself given that it's a genetic disease, is quite excruciating. It means a lot of people will avoid going through it again for emotional reasons. Now let's make the comparative. They he tells us they have a hard life on eh on their side of the house. Sure. On our side of the house to have to live day in and day out with the idea that a, they could have had a child and they chose not to, b, that child could have brought them joy, and c, that they to an extent abandoned that child. We think all of that is much more painful, much more harmful and overall much worse than having a child who has specific genetic disabilities. For these reasons we are proud to oppose.
If the problem that side government has in this debate is with dangerous activities, what is going to be the verdict of traditional sports that are also dangerous? Mountain climbing, formula one races, american football, traditional skiing, boxing, hockey. This is starting to be quite a lot of things that government is going to ban and this gives us a hint of how dangerous it becomes when the criteria of what allows the government to intervene is vague. James tells us firstly that there is an asymmetry of information between the children that these sports appeal to and the companies that take advantage of their innocence. Two answers here, a, the reason that these sports are more appealing to children is that we're talking about relatively new fields. Children are interested in all types of sports, not just extreme sports. And when people grow up they are more interested in sports that they knew growing up. So they'll go to see baseball games and not x games because they didn't grew up on it. And it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks. But once this generation is going to get older, where we are we will see more and more adults that will be interested in x games, in fact this is already happening. B, there are many other fields that are trying to appeal to children and to sell stuff to them. This is obviously true in cases like mcdonald's and other junk food companies in which case we are even talking about something that also does end up harming those children, but this is also true in cases of toy manufacturers that just want to sell more and more barbie dolls that the children don't really need. In all of those fields we can talk about the power imbalance that proposition are talking about but we don't simply shut down every toy manufacturer or every junk food company because luckily it is still the parents that are responsible for the children and get to decide what they agree and don't agree to buy them. Then james moves on to talk about damage to third parties. The families that are suffering and the burden that this has on the healthcare system. Only james neglects to mention that in liberal societies we believe in the principle that says that the citizen has the freedom and the right to do things that risks that like might harm him. If in every step that I take I had to factor in what might be the ultimate costs to the healthcare system or the suffering to my family than people were not not of been able to take any kind of risk. By the way we're not only talking about physical risks. Note, the same logic also applies to financial risks. If I bet on a stock, or I try and go out with a new business venture, there is a chance that I am going to lose my money. If the government was allowed to take into account the harm to my family and to the rest of the economy then they will force me not to do it and at this point this is no longer a free society but a tyranny. Then he says that it's bad for the sporting culture because it doesn't involve teamwork and this comes at the expense of other sporting activities that might have taught me more about team work. There are some hugely problematic things with this argument. Let's touch upon them one by one. First, clearly when you reach a professional level in which you compete with other people than you do have a coach and sponsors and staff and all of this. But this is less important, even if it were true. B, to a great many people, maybe even most people, the only like sport activities that they do come down to, either running or swimming or going to the gym, no teamwork here. Does the government really think that this is enough of a cause to simply ban all of these things? C, people have a limited amount of time, so to a great extent, everything that I do in on my free time is a trade off. When I play in the computer or when I watch television this comes at the expense of other things that involve teamwork. Maybe this should have been banned as well. So in short, we simply don't understand where does this assertion come from that people are somehow obligated to this idea of team work. What side government don't seem to understand in this debate is the huge difference between saying that one thing is preferential to another thing and between thinking that it's legitimate for the government to step in and forbid what it finds as less beneficial. Please oppose the motion.
Don't raise the corporate tax. This is a debate about how companies respond to these kinds of political actions. We're going to agree with james in the principled level that it would be good if companies contributed more to the systems they benefit from, but that's not the problem and it's not what today's debate is about. The problem is that companies just take actions to circumvent these laws anyway that oftentimes have a lot worse risks on the a lot worse impacts on the country than simply if you would let them exist without these large corporate taxes. James is well-intentioned but doesn't solve the underlying problem. Three main arguments: first, on people losing their jobs. Rich people don't want to abandon their income. What this means is that when you have a corporation that is making a lot of profit or maybe it's a smaller company that is making less profit, in both scenarios, a corporate tax imposes a known cost that they will have to adjust to. What this means is that they will fire people in advance because they will want to maintain the same profit margin. Recognize the majority of companies don't need the amount of people they hire to function. You can overload individual workers and then fire the rest so you can make the same money. This is bad both because those people left now getting who are left behind now get worse working conditions, but also because people now lose their jobs who were previously relying on the income and don't necessarily get a replacement. And the way that this act is really pernicious, on both levels, first, in that the corporations that are larger are just like crappy organizations, right? They don't care about the benefits of their customers or their workers, they just want to accrue profit. So this is something that is really going to harm the workers there. But also, the small companies that want to stay afloat are going to have to do this, because they're simply just not going to have the money to afford the corporate tax and maintain a profit at the same time. So that's like the double-edged sword here, is that james isn't just forcing like large companies to pay at the cost of these workers, he's also actively making it harder for small corporations to continue to exist. Our second argument is about prices going up. Like we need to make up the profit lost through corporate tax as these corporations. So they do things like raise the cost of goods and services, and this is really bad for the people who want to buy them, especially people can't afford the increase in cost, but the company still manages to profit off of individuals who can afford it, so they don't care. And the problem here is that james tries to like get away by adding these interesting counter-models where he says that like, " oh, look, but we're gonna tax on profit within a given country, " or like, " we're going to tax according to like the individual country tax codes. " Like the problem here is that both prices and cutting jobs are things that are independent of whether or not or like the mechanism by which you have these taxes, right? So we think that this isn't going to happen, no matter what james tries to model it as. But our third argument is about how corporations move overseas. Like recognize that other states don't necessarily have the same kind of taxes, so corporations who feel like the corporate tax is too much of a burden are likely to move to other countries. James tries to get around this with a bunch of different models but, first, even if they're getting taxed according to the country's tax codes, they'll just moved more of their business to the countries with lower taxes, right? Like we think that a lot of these companies can find large consumer bases that might make up the profit that they lose somewhere else, like they're not unique to large western liberal democracies that have good corporate tax laws. But also, then he gives us this idea that infrastructure and permanent spending will be highest where your industrial center is , and like maybe you're only taxing on that. But the problem here is that that just means that you're going to put all of your like fixed cost stuff besides those individual stores in a different country and then only pay for the infrastructure that you put in as individual stores, which is never going to be as large as your like large industrial center and like factory. So that doesn't solve the problem either. So, either way, we just think this ends up rebounding in a really toxic way, even if the policy itself is trying to accomplish something positive. Proud to oppose.
Don't ban homeopathy. Tim says it's good to have an informed citizenry. We think that we can get that without a ban. Like obviously we need good education about what types of homeopathy work versus don't but we think that instituting a ban is much too extreme of an action to solve a problem that can be easily resolved with better education and more access to hospitals. Especially since tim's alternatives seems to be just blindly trusting hospitals and pharmaceutical companies. Where there are massive amounts of research manipulation and unclear science as well as a massive profit incentive. All things that would generally mock up the majority of tim's offense which is basically comes down to science is good, pharma is science and homeopathy isn't. This is a massive misunderstanding of the way in which pharma works. The amount of recalls that we've had of general pharmaceutical company's compounds and the way in which homeopathy has developed over time. Two main arguments: first, on why homeopathy works. A dislike of homeopathy is widely based on a corporate culture that likes being able to make money off of everything and wants ownerships of the techniques that make people feel better. This doesn't mean that homeopathy doesn't work. In fact, the majority of modern medicine are based on natural molecules and compounds that have healing effects on the human body. There's plenty of scientific research on things involved in homeopathy, things ranging from the beneficial effects of ginger to things like ashwagandha moving the other direction to to things like iodine which were used for years before other companies came in and decided that it would be an exclusively like protective corporate thing. A lot of cultures have long term passed down different remedies that supply these healing effects without incurring the kinds of costs that pharmaceutical companies and hospitals will leverage for a more standardized version of similar care. Tim's worried about children. We've think that parents wants what is best for children either way. If the homeopathy doesn't work presumably they'll go to a hospital or they're just crazy and aren't going to take their kids to a hospital either way because they're those anti-vaccine moms that think that they're that smart and that much better than regular science. Like tim talks about using it for cancer. Like we just think that at the point that you're someone who would be stupid enough to use it for that intense of a disease, you're someone who's stupid enough to just not go to the hospital either way. Like these clearly aren't the types of people that we're discussing in this round. Crazy people are going to exist on both sides of the house. The only question becomes what is the rationale that people take who are rational about where they're going to go, how they're going to treat themselves, so on so forth. We also think that keeping kids out of pharma has very tangible benefits at the point that the pharmaceutical industry has massive problems with overdiagnosing, overprescribing, and oftentimes having really problematic side effects that can affect people into the long term. So we just don't think it's always best for a parent to give their kids a shitload of pharmaceuticals as opposed to maybe using a homeopathic method first. Our second argument is about the way in which it makes people feel better. Like plenty of people don't trust hospitals for very justified reasons. People of color who have been historically experimented on without their consent, women who are often told that their pain is fake and that they're being hysterical and are recommended unhelpful treatments, who are simply diagnosed incorrectly, like these people aren't going to go to a hospital either way. So at least on our side of the house they'll have something else to rely on and use. We also think that oftentimes homeopathy stems to some cultural inheritance or some cultural edge. Like it puts people back in touch with those things if they happen to be people whose family is from china and they're using traditional chinese medicine or similar situations and we think that that also provides comfort insofar as it just provides a certain familiarity or maybe it's nostalgic in some ways. Tim is worried about how this like raises costs in medicine. Like this is just marginal at best, right? Like first this depends on a lot of arguments of his actually being true IE he has to prove to you that homeopathy is actually causing people to be more sick in the long term and therefore go to the hospital more. Like he has to prove it to you that this happens often enough that this actually has an impact on long term government spending. We don't think any of that is true. Proud to oppose.
Don't abolish the jobs act. We think the problem with a lot of what danny says is that he seems to agree that the jobs act is a fundamentally positive policy, rather his only concern seems to be that it isn't enough. But saying that something isn't enough isn't a reason to abolish it, first, because the political capital that danny is worried about has already been used. Abolishing the legislation won't bring the capital or the money back so you might as well keep it around and try to make it larger later. Since this was pretty much all of danny's offense, we think that we already win the round. But also, because this act was the result of an uphill battle, this is what we get to after there's already been a really large amount of compromise and political back and forth. We think that this is fair to say that it is the best that we're going to get, and it would be awful to waste it. The problem with a lot of what danny says is that he doesn't actually propose a mechanism by which we get a better deal after we abolish this one. So we think what actually happens on the government side is that you get rid of the current jobs act but you have nothing to replace it with, and you have no political capital because you've already used it up on an iteration that you then got rid of. I don't think we really have to give any more of a speech, but I will. Two main arguments, first on why it's good for small businesses. Recognize that a lot of what the job acts does is that it cuts the tax rate specifically for small business. This allows them to have less expenditures so they can put more money into growth: things like hiring more people, expanding stock or services, upgrading their locations, literally any number of actions that are beneficial to those small businesses. This is really important, because these kinds of policies also encourage more small businesses opening up. In the status quo, there's a fairly large uphill battle that small businesses have to fight in order to stay open after they've become established. There's a ridiculously large statistic for how many small businesses actually close after the first year of operation because they can't make any profit. We think that when you have things like the american jobs act, small businesses see that it is easier to start up and less risky, so people who are considering starting one are more likely to do so and take that leap. This is really important because small businesses are really good for the united states. They provide better economic growth than large corporations, which often last tie a lot of their money up in foreign assets and do things a lot overseas, but also they work on a smaller regional level so they reach just more corners of the united states than the alternative. Our second argument is about protecting jobs. Danny explains that for a long time for danny spends a long time explaining why passing this kind of legislature is really hard, then proposes an alternative that consists of passing more legislature that would be more extreme. Like we just think that it is really clear why his arguments are completely hypocritical. At the point that he says it's difficult to pass this legislature at all, it is completely unclear to me how he passes something more stringent than what we have now. He's already provided us all the reasons why we can't do his alternative. Meanwhile, the current jobs act has clauses that help veterans find new jobs by providing a tax credit to the companies that hire them. It puts money into public schools that they otherwise wouldn't receive, especially into stem funding that a lot of public schools don't have in the status quo due to how expensive a lot of the lab materials are. It prevents teacher layoffs, and it keeps the jobs of firefighters and police. It invests in public infrastructure like roads that we really, really need in a lot of parts of the united states, and it spreads wifi access which provides information to individuals and provides the tools for success to individuals who didn't have it, because recognize that we live in a world that massively requires individuals to have access to the internet if they want to do things like maintain communications for jobs or even apply to jobs, or if they are interested in doing things like continuing their education in any way. Like at the point that danny doesn't provide a feasible alternative but thinks that the jobs act has positive impacts, we might as well keep what we have around. Proud to oppose.
The main clash in this debate, as we see it, focuses on the question what can be considered justified? Eventually, most, if not all, of the case of side government rests on the benefits of this bombing, in hindsight, and this requires a type of consequentialist approach to moral philosophy: if this action has led to the end of the war and eventually saved more lives than it would have been that like then more lives than would have been taken otherwise, then it is justified. We wish to challenge the very premise of this approach. We could argue on whether or not it's true that the japanese wouldn't have surrendered otherwise but in a more fundamental level, we want to argue that at the point in time at which this decision was made to to use the a-bomb, without having the benefit of hindsight, hell, they barely even had any idea as to the immediate consequences, not to mention the long-term consequences, of this weapon, at that point, the decision to target innocent civilians with deadly force of such magnitude can never be justified, no matter what the final outcomes of this thing are going to be. Pay attention that we are relenting the consequentialist approach that only is interested in the aftermath and we're adopting a different view, one that is more concerned with the decision itself and says that certain things can just never be justified, no matter what happens as a result from them, and throwing a nuclear bomb into the heart of a civilian population probably tops this list. But how could we weigh and decide between these two conflicting approaches? So, we would offer the next thought experiment. Now, I'm really sorry upfront for the violent description, but I find it necessary. Imagine that I'm walking down the street and in front of me, I see a a young mother walking with this with a little little baby. For some reason, in a moment of passion, I decide to murder that baby. So I snatch it from the hands of its mom and throw it to the middle of the road. Now what happens is, without me being able to foresee it, it turns out that the car that just pass through had kim jong-un sitting in the back, the merciless dictator from from north korea. And as a result from the baby being thrown to the middle of the road, the driver of the car quickly maneuvers away and instead of hitting the baby, hits a light post and kills kim jong-un that sits in the back. The baby remains safely untouched. As a result of kim's sudden death, a peaceful revolution takes place in north korea, where they establish a democracy that , you know, sets free millions of civilians from the yoke of the oppressive regime that they've been under for several decades. Now let us ask: was I justified in throwing the baby to the middle of the road? Clearly, the answer is absolutely not. Some things are just forbidden, you can never do them. And trying to murder an innocent baby is one of them, and it doesn't make any difference that the final outcome of of trying to murder the baby was has brought a lot of good. So, what we say is simply that the decision to throw an atom bomb on japan, without really being able to tell that this is what's going to to lead to the end of the of the world war and to peace between japan and the united states, is one hundred percent analogous to this example and for this reason, we are very proud to oppose.
It is essential that we start by saying that we do not have anything against allowing as many people as possible access to the internet. Our objection in this debate is not of the practical level but rather merely and solely on the principled one. Here is where government's side is trying to confuse you: they tell you that everyone has a right to get access to things such as education and transportation because this is the only way to facilitate certain basic civil liberties. But pay attention that that does not mean that people have a right to get their education from an ivy league university, or own a private car. Even though these things are going to allow for a better actualization of the very liberties that education and transportation allow. This means that even if the government is in fact obligated to supply its citizens the ability to certain fulfillment of a liberty, it does not follow that it is obligated to to allow him the optimal or maximal fulfillment of that liberty. This would be something that we shall name privilege, and it is in fact in many ways the complete opposite of a basic right. So, what does eitan have to say specifically about the internet itself? First he talks about the freedom of speech and how most of public discourse happens online, but following what I said in my opening, this is just not the relevant question. That's just like saying that most people use their freedom of movement today in order to, you know, fly off to a vacation abroad. This doesn't mean that if someone isn't able to partake in that type of activity, then this necessarily means that his freedom of movement is being infringed upon. So long as these people can voice their opinions in the street and still find an audience that listens to them, then as far as the government goes, and the government's obligation to supply people with the basic facilitation of rights, we say that that this is good enough. We simply disagree with the assertion according to which access to facebook is the most fundamental, you know, form of participation in freedom of speech. Just like we do not believe that the government is obligated to, you know, supply every person with a megaphone that allows for as many people as possible to hear him. Next eitan goes on to talk about the equality of opportunity. Here we have a different problem. We simply don't agree that equality of opportunity is a basic right that the government is obligated to give you from the first place. It is true for the simple reason that it this is literally physically impossible to commit to such a thing. People are born in very different starting points, ridiculously different starting points in life that create a very stark inequality in opportunity. Now even if that is something that we could have somehow taken care of, people are still being born with very different sets of skills and abilities that also create huge differences in, like, and inequalities in opportunities and there is nothing that we can do about that. So, all of these things will undoubtedly affect the job places that each person finds for himself with or without the internet. Therefore as far as equality, we say that the very best that the government can and in fact should offer is you know complete equality before the law. That's it. Again, this does not mean that the government shouldn't aspire to improve the equality of opportunity by providing you know wide access to internet. This simply means that this would be principally wrong to see this as something that a person can demand from his government as a basic right that is worthy of protection. For all these reasons please oppose
We look at this question from the perspective of real politic. If there is anything that could be learned from observing the world around us, is that in order to be a superpower you need to act tough. We debaters love talking about values and morality and all types of lovey dovey made up concepts and to think that love will triumph. We desperately need a wake up call. Look at trump. At putin. At arduan. Look at xi jinping. These strong men did not build a reputation based on their morality or their niceness, but on the image of being a tough guy. A determined guy. And the outcome is that they only grow stronger and stronger and so is there public support. This is what people look for in a leader today. In the same manner, we think that that's also what people look for in a superpower, in the leader of the world per se. So sure, holding gtmo may not be moral, whatever that means, and the cubans may not like it that we are still there, but as the previous speaker himself mentions, this did not stop them from wanting to normalize the trade relations with the US as soon is fidel died. It's just like russia that was able to annex crimea and intervene in syria, and is slowly but surely just like going back to being a superpower and the world sits idly by and there's not do anything about it. The previous speaker is concerned for the soft power of the united states but I think that it wouldn't be serious to argue that people have stopped looking at the united states as a symbol due to guantanamo. The united states will remain a superpower so long as it's the world's strongest economy, so long as it has the strongest army in the world and so long as there is no real opposition for hollywood. These are the things that fuel america's soft power and once they will vanish, so will the soft power of the united states, and guantanamo has really very little to do with that. So now you reach the question of torture and like is it justified, or is it useful. And here, again, we don't really want to talk too much about make belief principles, or but like we wanna be as straightforward as possible. The relevant question is whether guantanamo helps the security, the national security of the united states. And because we think that the lives of our citizens matter more than the lives of people that are planning terror attacks against them. So this is as far as we are willing to go in terms of principle. The previous speaker argues that torture isn't effective because prisoners will tell you what you want to hear and not what you need to hear or something like that, and I'm unclear as to what this means. We definitely think that torture can be effective, especially if it's done by professionals and especially in the case of people who are like ideologically driven against the west, and they will not want to cooperate in any other way. So this could be the only way to subtract valuable information from them. Look, obviously I'd I can't really name real life examples here, but I can use common sense and understand that the US government would not have went through the trouble of holding gtmo and would not be willing to pay like the huge sums that it does in order to to maintain it unless it would actually help. Please oppose the motion.
Daniel tells us a good journalism is important, we agree. What he doesn't tell us is how his subsidies create good journalism, and that's where we disagree. We're going to talk to you about, what happens when the watchdog of democracy is beholden to the same democracy, he is supposed to watch over. Sh before that, two points of extraneous rebuttal: one, he says: we're talking mostly about local papers which are dying out. So, we're going to talk a little bit more about, what that looks like in the argument. But two responses other than that: one, note it doesn't quite fit the problem daniel describes, see daniel is talking about how online media moguls are replacing, and basically pricing out regular newspapers. This doesn't really happen with local floridian newspapers, because nobody online is interested in what they're doing, and doesn't have a big enough online market share. It specifically those local papers who generally manage to survive, by publicizing local businesses, which again online mean nothing, and by selling to local people. Secondly, note that working online models do exist, so he tells you: well, you know people put on adblocker, so you can't make money. No, like, you can sell a prescription to to the online newspaper, or you can shut the site down, if somebody has an ad blocker until they turned it off. Like, that literally exists already and does work. Secondly, they say good news is important, more limited misrepresentation of facts. We agree with the end goal, we're just not entirely sure that, being subsidized by the government of alternative facts is how you're going to get to news media outlets that present the real fact. Let's talk about what happens when you're watchdog is beholden to the government. So, daniel rightfully tells us, this debate isn't about the wall street journal, the washington post, those people do fine. What happens when the government comes to, let's say, thh north northwest florida, and says: okay there are about twelve local newspapers here, each of which is dying out. We need to save one of them, two of them, make sure that there's some quality news up here in northwest florida. So the government tell them, look we're looking to save one of you. And these newspapers now start to fight it out with each other, who is the one is going to be saved. Who do you think is more likely to be saved, the newspaper that continues bashing the president, bashing the republican party, or the one who aligns with it, the one who defends kellyanne conway? We think the most likely scenario is either, through active choice, or through bias subconscious decisions, preferring people with the same direction as they have, the government is likely to subsidize specifically those newspapers that support their side, that side with them, that don't attack them as much. By doing this, they're taking the claws out of the reason, behind which newspapers and media is actually important: allowing the citizens to defend themselves, protect themselves against their own government. It is important that news continue to exist, and be able to exist, and be able to run financially, but not at any cost. Not when it's the government itself subsidizing that news, and that means that the news is beholden to the government. At that point, the news becomes pointless. It no longer serves its purpose, and I'm better off with less funding, and less research that at least trying to get to the truth, and do the right thing. For these reasons, please oppose.
Affirmative action is a huge subject, a huge topic, and there's plenty of different models to talk about. Since we only have four minutes, I'm going to focus my opposition to specifically the field of affirmative action in institutions of higher education. Let's engage with the material that we get from the previous speaker. So the first point they make is that is about how less qualified people end up in like taking part in the institions, in this case higher education, and we simply don't accept that this is necessarily the case. We think, and and our opponents will obviously agree, that many times it is the fact that you belong to some disenfranchised group that makes you underperform relatively to other groups and not because you are less gifted or that your potential is lower. So let's say let's let's just picture two applicants trying to get accepted to a prestigious university: the one got to attend a like top-notch elementary and high schools and had private tutors to assist in any class that he had difficulties with, and parents that always encouraged and pushed him for academic excellency, while the other went to a low-budget school and his parents needed him to stay at home and help with his younger brothers and sisters while they are at work, so they never were able to get to any parents meeting or anything. So it seems pretty obvious that the gaps in the grades that these two two kids will be able to present to the, you know, committee of the the university don't actually testify to their skills. So there's an inherent problem of a of like a systematical discrimination in in the system of just relying purely on grades and on hard data. And this is a problem that affirmative action helps to at the very at the very least, like mitigate and reduce. The second thing that they say in this regard is that the people that have received affirmative action suffer from stigma because other people will think that they didn't achieve this on their own. The first answer to this is that such stigmas tend to disappear once you see that that they do succeed and that much and like you start matching their achievements to yours in class and so on. And the second answer is that even if it is true that there's always a somewhat of a stigma, this is still preferable to a situation where they wouldn't have even received this opportunity to begin with, because then you suffer both the stigma from others looking down at you and so on and that lack of opportunities and tools to actually improve your own future. And eventually they they tell us, in this point, that the people that have received affirmative action are more likely to drop out. Again, we do not think that this is necessarily true but even if it is true, at the very least, they have been granted an opportunity, which is already much more than they get in the status quo. The next point that they talk about is that due to the gaps in education, like because gaps in education is a is a problem that starts at a at an earlier age, we need to fix that, and affirmative action is somehow mutually exclusive with a real solution. Why? Because it satiates liberals. Well, we fail to understand how this is truly mutually exclusive. It's hard for us to believe that to believe that liberals or anybody else will just say: no, no, because we already give a tiny percent of these people affirmative action at a later age, we shouldn't aspire for equality in education from a younger age. This seems unlikely. But even if but like and even like regardless, if an even if a reform does take place in education, what sadly doesn't look like really is something that's going to happen in the in the next coming years, we say that this will still be too late for the generations of children that has have just missed this reform. So, they definitely deserve this affirmative action as a corrective justice for the harm that they have suffered. Lastly, they talk about the backlash from extreme right groups but this is, of course, a very weak point because according to this logic then, we mustn't ever implement any type of policy that is going to like that's going to make extreme racists angry. This basically means that every policy that that like the better a policy is and the more just it is, the more we're going to have to avoid it. This is absurd. There are always radical extremists that like to make noise. We can't let them set the tone. Affirmative action is an unfair measure that helps to correct a bigger unfairness or a bigger injustice, and we ought support it.
It should be clear that there are good immigrants and there are bad immigrants. Simply a numbers game. With this many immigrants you're bound to have some good ones and some bad ones but we think the measure of whether immigration has had an overall good effect or bad effect is in fact not the the immigrants that all. It is the american population and we will be measuring through them whether or not they've affected for the better or for the worse. Before that a whole lot of points of refutation. One, we're told they're good for the economy and two reasons were given is a, they they create a boost to the work force, note this is a situation in with the american economy has more more people to work than it does jobs. This is why so many people in america are unemployed. A boost to the work force is not a good thing for the economy currently. Secondly, they say it creates a boost to consumption. Note you're taking people who in the end of their speech they say are extremely poor, from impoverished countries, just trying to get away, and calling them a boost to the consumption. Most of these people are not consuming very much. Now, the counter to that is the expenditures that these people create. They create expenditures in security needs, they create expenditures in bureaucracies to deal with immigration, they create expenditures in buying them basic needs like food, like clothing etcetera since a lot of them are extremely poor. This means as an overall they are a harm to the economy in most cases. Secondly, he says: " they take the jobs that americans don't really want to do. " We ask: what are these jobs that americans don't want to do? Because we claim there are no jobs that americans won't do. There are conditions that americans won't work. Americans will clean an elephant's poop in the zoo too if you pay them more than minimum wage. So essentially what these people are doing is not taking the jobs that americans don't want, it's enabling abusive employers to maintain abusive conditions for their workers. We don't think that's an overall good, we think that's a harm. Thirdly, he says this creates cultural enrichment. That would be wonderful in an ideal world. In the real world what you get if things like cultural hatred and xenophobia. We'll get to that in the argument. Fourthly, they say immigration is difficult. Yes, that's true. This is a harm not a good he says that they the reason they come here none the less is because of safety issues. Those aren't immigrants, those are refugees. Don't confuse the two. And lastly he sums up that point by saying: " if they're going through all this there must be a reason. There must be some great good at it. " False. We say there is a promise for a great good. We say they are told they can live the american dream. The reality is much harsher and very different to that. The good at the end of the tunnel doesn't actually exist for these people. So what does exist? We say the major effect that immigrants have had is fueling the need of the american people for an enemy. What do we mean? It is true that some immigrants have been successful actors, nobel laureate, scientists, whatever. However it is also true that some of them have been extremely poor and this makes sense that some of them due to that poverty have turned to crime and this also makes sense. It's also true that some of them take american jobs and this also make sense. The problem is that people tend to unite against a common enemy. And it just so happens that immigrants were chosen as the common american enemy to unite against. What this has created is a situation in which the cultures of these people, the religions of these people, the beliefs, the homelands of these people, have all been demonized through the notion of demonizing the immigrants themselves. The amount of hatred and xenophobia created due to immigration in the united states, and note, not because of the immigrants but because of the americans and the way they reacted towards the immigration, has been unbelievable. It has led to things like trump being elected, like a wall almost being built between the united states and mexico. All of this we say is a greater harm than any immigrant has ever brought the united states. Please oppose.
Two things we're gona talk about in this debate. One, how slump tourism helps the local economy, and two, on how it helps attract investments and donation thereby helping the local economy on a more macro level. Three points of refutation before that. One, note that in daniel's speech, he merely asserts that this doesn't actually help. He gives lots of reasons why it might not help, but he never shows you that it doesn't help. We will show you in our speech that it, in fact, does. Two, he says people profit off of struggle of other people and that's messed up. Note, two things. One, we don't understand why that's messed up. We think people selling pharmaceuticals profit over the struggle of other people, however, during the course of that they also benefit those people and that's very far from messed up. In fact it's one of the most important industries that exist today. The same is true of people selling food to anyone who is hungry. We think those people do something rather important. The same is true here, at the point at which we show you that this is actually beneficial to the to the local economies of those people. Lastly, he says if you think you're you're doing good, then, you won't end up doing more good. So, this is mutually exclusive with other versions of charity donations, etcetera. Two things about that. One, it's patently false. Most people enter charity not by giving all of their life to charity, but rather but rather by doing one good deed, giving to charity once, etcetera. Then, they like the way it makes them feel, they like the way their donation has helped, they like the results that they end up getting, and they end up becoming more emotionally invested. It's more, foot in the door psychology. As you become more invested in it, you have a sunk cost in an issue, and therefore you're more likely to continue investing in it. So we think it's patently false that this is mutually exclusive. But secondly and crucially, note, this is tourism, not charity. Which means, even if it were true that doing one small good deed made you satiated with good deeds, these people do not get the feeling of doing one small good deed because as far as they're concerned, they're on vacation taking a tour. All they see is that while they're on vacation touring and enjoying their lives, all of these people are suffering. We'll talk about that more in the second point. First, let's talk about local economy. Look, it's very simple. In order to have an economy work, a local economy, you need people with buying power within that economy. That means that if you wanna drive a cab you need people who can afford to take a cab. It means if you want to open a restaurant you need people who can afford to eat at a restaurant. If you wanna open a supermarket, you need people who can afford to buy at a supermarket. All of these things, are problems, endemic problems with self sustained communities of poverty, because, they can't afford the nicer things, therefore they can't open the nice their businesses, therefore they can't continuously can't afford the nicer things. The solvency for this problem comes specifically from slum tourism. Because those are the people who go in and eat at the nice restaurant for lunch everyday, those are the people who go in and take cabs from place to place, those are the people who go in and buy the hand crocheted tee shirts made by the elderly women of the community, just to remember their experience in their community. All of this means, they insert, inject a huge cash flow that wouldn't have otherwise existed into the local economy, in turn, by the way, allowing more buying power to the individuals within the economy to continue purchasing inside their environment. All of this means it is a massive economic boost. Let's talk about attracting investments and donations. Because we think what ends up happening is, not many, but some of those people get a spark, get an idea. Either an emotional spark saying, wow these people are suffering while I'm out here on vacation and I should help, and then they end up giving to charity and helping those people, or a business spark, saying, here's an economy that is still in its roots, and I can open up something here and make it big. By being exposed to the societies, you make it more likely that large influxes of cash get injected into the economies by entrepreneurs who, now with exposure, know of a way in which they can profit within these societies. All of this means, that in the macro level you are also helping the economy of these people. We beg to oppose the motion.
We should not further exploit natural gas. The government side tries to paint this as a discussion over a trade-off between coal and oil and natural gas but we think that this argument in this debate is really a debate about whether or not in a world with climate change any more funds should be invested in a carbon emitting source of energy like natural gas which we think is entirely unnecessary. Regardless of the comparative benefits of natural gas with coal and oil, those benefits will never exceed the comparative benefits of other clean sources like wind, solar and nuclear energy. Which is why we think that any resources that the government side would have us invest in natural gas should be invested in these other alternatives. The first argument that they make is that this is a stepping stone to a cleaner world but we think there's a few problems with this. The first is that we think that this is a largely unnecessary stepping stone because if the eventual goal is to transition to a world that is post fossil fuels, a world like a solar powered or a nuclear powered world, then the infrastructure that is required for those types of things are meaningfully different in a way that it's not a stepping stone but rather it's just a sideways transition before we ultimately get to clean fuel. But the problem with putting investment in something like natural gas say you transition say you spend a lot of resources to transition your coal-fired power plants to natural gas natural gas power plants, well that investment entrenches natural gas in a meaningful way. Instead we would rather have an investment to directly transition from coal-fired power plants to nuclear power plants or solar power plants because this means that there's no entrenchment of infrastructure that's unnecessary and we ultimately get better clean energy resources. The next thing they say is that natural gas produces less smog as like an example of how it's a comparative benefit. Again, we think that electric is always going to be better than natural that clean electricity is always going to be better than natural gas and so the comparative in this debate is really or the question in this debate is whether or not any more resources should go towards exploiting natural gas than the status quo. The second argument that they make is that natural gas promotes trade and stability which ultimately leads to more long term peace and this is the kind of only argument that I think they give about why it's a good stepping stone towards clean energy rather than just a direct transition in saying that stability requires for example russia, one of the major powers in the world, and they are mainly a petrostate so having a world that has natural gas ties them closer to the west and therefore creates less hostility and the same goes for natural gas in the middle east and north africa in that you give time for these countries to build up resources which they can then use to diversify so that eventually when we make this transition these countries will be in a better position than if we were to make a transition right now to totally clean energy. But we think there's a few problems with this. The first is that this is a short-termist view at best cause either we're going to make a transition to clean tech soon or we're going to face major damages from global warming, the damage of which will outweigh any sort of risk of instability in these regions and promote global the downfall of global order rather than just regional order. So we think that we should we should we would rather take the risk that the government side is right and that maybe we create a little more a little less trade and a little more instability but we think that ultimately this is preferable to their world. The other issue is that we actually don't think trade goes up as much as they say because many of the countries that are currently relying on oil and coal are much richer in natural gas than they are in those resources and so the comparative trade gains are less than the government paints. For these reasons, we should not further exploit natural gas.
Racial profiling isn't always effective, it isn't always relevant. Sometimes it is. In particular neighborhoods, an individual's race may be statistically correlated positively with crime. We think in those neighborhoods, it makes sense for a police officer to be more suspicious of someone of that race. In airports, for example, in particular countries, being of a particular religion may be highly correlated with being with the likelihood of setting off a bomb in an airplane. We think that is something that police should take into account when checking. Obviously, we don't think it should happen always, we do think it should happen when it is statistically relevant and likely. The argument we're going to make is on comparative rights. About why police need to protect above all else. Before that, four points of rebuttal to tim. One. He says a presumption of innocence needs to exist. Note, presumption of innocence is something that exists in a courtroom, not in police suspicion. The reason for this is because in order for police to do their job, they have to create suspects. This is how they discover whether or not someone is actually guilty, by creating a suspect, checking if they're a suspect, and then bringing them to the court, at the worst case, for the court to decide whether or not they're innocent. Secondly, he says there are massive harms to communities, and the truth is we agree with tim on that. We simply think that a comparative world in which racial profiling is illegal, so to speak, is not one in which these harms happen any less. Why? Racial profiling did not create racism. It did not create the notion that people of particular races are more likely to commit crimes. We think in a situation in which racial profiling is banned, and we think this has been shown in various states across the united states where they have tried to ban it, what ends up happening is over-policing in order to get the information, so to speak, that they need in order to justify their assumptions of guilt in the first place. We think what happens is planting of evidence after you search and frisk someone, because you are entirely sure that based on their race that person is guilty, and when you realize that they're not, in order to protect yourself, you planted a bag of weed or whatever it is on that eh on that person. All of these things are are even more harmful to these communities when they're done, so to speak, on the black market. Thirdly, he says it's ineffective statistically because of the history that's involved. Well, only if you measure statistically poorly, if you only take into account the last, say, ten years and you seem to get a pretty accurate statistic depiction of who's likely to commit a crime. And lastly, he says all of this means that this isn't really who they are deep down inside, it's just, you know, what they do. Why in god's name should we care about what the motivations are for committing the crime when we're trying to prevent the crime? This brings me into my first and only argument: the job of police. We recognize that societies and individuals within societies have rights to things like privacy. However, note, that as it stands today, we already recognize that the public's right to security supersedes the individual's right both to privacy and often to dignity as well. Now they'll say sure, that's when you have reason to believe that. Two responses to this. A, note, statistically we do have reason to believe that these individuals are likely to commit a crime. This is similar to the way that we over-police individuals who have come out of jail, even though they've supposedly paid that back their debt to society, however because of the rates of recidivism, we know they're more likely to commit another crime, and therefore take liberties with their liberties. B, note, it's already accepted as preventative measures. When you board a plane, your entire belongings are rummaged through. When you walk into a public place, you're likely on CCTV being recorded. All of this means, it is already accepted that your privacy and your dignity come second to public security. We see no reason for that to change, just because the you in this case is grouped together around a race, around a religion, around an socioeconomic class, or around a gender. No matter what, police need to put society first.
Throughout tim's entire speech, he deals with how global warming requires a drastic change from the way in which we consume energy in the status quo, and he does take a lot of time to explain this all. But sadly, this is entirely uncontested and therefore not a clash in this debate. We agree, but the relevant question, the only relevant question, is how is this change supposed to look like and whether focusing specifically on wind power production does more harm or more good. To this question, tim only dedicates the very last minute of his speech. What we hear in this regard from him is a: that wind power is a clean and renewable energy that doesn't cause too much environmental damage, b: that the costs of wind power production our high today but if we further exploit it, it will drive down the costs, and c: that it's preferable to solar power and nuclear power. We find all three of these claims problematic. Let's examine them closely and understand why. So, firstly, wind power is renewable and clean. Well, it is renewable and perhaps relatively clean, of course, it's not perfect for the environment, and wind farms do adversely affect the wildlife and natural habitats and scenery of wherever they are located. We can expect that we can accept that it's relatively clean, but by no means is it the only clean energy alternative or not even the cleanest, case in point: solar power and water power. But even if it were the cleanest, most renewable kind of energy, what tim neglects to talk about is whether it's effective enough so that we can afford to so heavily rely on it. The fact of the matter is that being clean and renewable are indeed very important traits, but they come second to feasibility and sustainability. Wind farms simply don't have and will never probably have the capacity to create enough energy to satisfy civilizations' ever-growing need for more of it. Why? Because the wind isn't and will never be as strong as a steam that that runs on fuel or on nuclear energy. We would have to get the entire oceans and mountains and forests crammed full of wind farms, at huge, huge costs, for it to maybe be somehow enough. But then tim says, " , but if we invest in research and development, it will drive costs down. " Except no, it wouldn't though, unless tim has plans to develop some new way to create more wind at greater speed artificially around the globe, which reach, by the way, will be also disastrous for the entire global climate probably. The point is that no matter how sophisticated we would get, it will never be enough to really satisfy demand. Obviously, we're not against setting some more wind farms, but we understand this motion and the definition given by side government to mean that we would now put all of our most like we would put all or most of our weight on wind energy, and that's just a bad investment. So, what is the proper alternative? Tim talks about solar power and nuclear power. There's also water power, as I mentioned. We believe that it's mostly these three that should be further explored. , tim is right that solar power isn't efficient twenty-four seven, but so isn't wind power. That's just false. There are entire seasons, months, during which there's hardly enough wind velocity to produce anything. Solar energy is also clean and renewable. And we believe that it's more cost efficient since it isn't meant to spin turbines in the same way that wind farms are, but it's based on directly converting light and PV cells into electric power. Water power does work on turbines, but it's much, much more powerful than wind in terms of velocity and pressure. Think about it. What's harder: walking against a strong wind or swimming against a strong current? Of course, that the latter. Nuclear energy is perhaps not renewable or clean, but it has incredible capacity to produce huge amounts of energy, and there's still so much to explore and improve our technology in this field. So for all of these reasons, please oppose.
Let's see what we get from side government. So, the first thing they mention is that there is a threat to third parties because if I don't take good care of myself, I might be infectious and be dangerous to other people. We would ask whether they are in favor of forcing sick people to undergo treatment under the same logic. And if their answer is yes, then we would ask in this case why do we need to also ban alternative medicine, and not simply allow people that anyway have to go through conventional treatments to to choose to also take alternative medicine if they believe this helps them? These are not two things that are mutually exclusive. Why not have both? Then they go on to say that there is a matter of an asymmetric information. They claim that the that the companies that manufacture these products know that their product isn't working and are lying to the innocent consumer and therefore, the state needs to step in and defend him. So, the first answer that we have is that we don't agree that the that the companies are necessarily lying. We think that it's certainly possible that they full-heartedly believe in their product, and they don't mind the fact that they can't prove this scientifically, because some people are skeptic towards this whole thing that's called science and the very basic premises of the modern the science so this simply doesn't mean a lot to them. There are a lot of such of people like this, this is not uncommon. Secondly, we say that the state already intervenes quite sufficiently when it provides regulation as to what can be called ordinary medicine and what can't be called that. So, by the very fact that these products are branded as alternative medicine, and not simply medicine, we are signaling to the consumers exactly what it is that they're buying. Beyond this point, we say that the consumer is a big boy. He can make decisions on his own, and he's responsible for whatever he's getting. The last thing that we'd say on this regard is that in the exact same way we can only warn you that cigarettes are harmful to you or that coca cola is isn't healthy to you, and we can write down exactly how much sugar is in there, but we're not going to prevent you from purchasing it. And then we hear that this is going to stop poaching that's used for alternative medicine, so we think that this point is a real stretch but, like, especially in light of the fact that all of the alternative medicine that's legally sold today don't contain these these ingredients that are prohibited. So, essentially what they're offering is to ban certain products that are made out of plants and didn't harm any animals for concern for animal welfare, but they don't have a problem if you go and buy a steak one second after that. That's weird to us. So the only thing that we would like to add to all of this is this: by all means, we think that like if we think that this is all just mumbo jumbo, then we can educate the public to be skeptical towards it. We've even agreed that we can force people who are sick to undergo conventional treatment, but this still doesn't justify preventing people from seeking other alternatives, especially not when their health is at stake. We believe that people have the right and the autonomy to choose to believe whatever it is that they believe, just like religious people can choose to go and pray if they are ill or to go and make a confession because they believe that god will help them. Please notice that according to the entire logic of side government, they are essentially saying that we mustn't allow religious people to reach out to their priests or to pray, because this would like probably wouldn't do them a lot of good in a proven manner. So, we say that it's just the same here, and we're very proud to oppose.
The government has made many arguments. I'm going to try and deal with the more important ones because we don't have time to answer everything. Let's start with the point about overproduction: we agree that subsidies might lead to overproduction. The thing is that the alternative isn't equilibrium between supply and demand, but rather underproduction. Let's explain why this is true and why this is worse: farming is an expensive thing. You have to own like, wide areas, you have to employ a lot of employees, you have to own equipment and machinery that are very expensive, you have to protect yourself from bad weather and so on and so forth. All of this means that no matter how high the demand for your product is, there is a certain set price that you cannot go under if you want to make a profit and continue on manufacturing. This means that the very basic things like bread, like dairy, like fruits and vegetables are supposed to be rather costly. Think for a minute about laptops or iphones where there is basically no limits to the amount of demand that these products have, but still, because we are talking about obviously something that is quite expensive to manufacture, they are quite expensive and clearly many people cannot afford to buy them. So that's exactly where the government steps in and says okay, I can live with people not having laptops, but I cannot allow my citizens to starve for bread, therefore, I will grant a subsidy that aims to lower the prices and to make these products more accessible to the entire public. This is why we subsidize, specifically, agriculture and, of course, if side government is worried about doctors, then we would mention that we also subsidize pharmaceuticals in hospitals, so no worries here. This means that without the government intervening, we have a situation of a demand surplus or an underproduction because as james rightfully explains, there will be far fewer dairy farmers that will manufacture far fewer milk and at higher prices, but the same amount of people that still wish to buy milk. So, necessarily, there will be people that still want this product but cannot afford it. Why do we prefer a situation of overproduction to this situation? Well, firstly, because at least this way, we don't have people that are being left hungry. But moreover, we say that with overproduction, we have the tools to grow more efficient over time. If the farmer sees that a lot goes to waste, he can plan out his next cycle to produce a little less. If the government sees that a lot of this produce is being thrown away, it can match the amount of subsidies accordingly. But with underproduction, there's simply nothing left to do because we simply cannot sell at a price that is lower than the cost of production. So, pay attention that this point also takes care of james' point about transferring money from the poor to the rich. We think that that is baloney because poor people pay far less taxes so this is money that's mainly being taken from people that are well-off and is being used in order to allow everyone to buy vital necessities, so obviously, we are helping the less fortunate here. The second argument I'll make is about trade and and like harming other farmers. This is, again, a point that we can simply accept in its full, but the thing is that the damage here is completely symmetrical under both sides of the house. Free trade also harms a lot of local farmers because their because, like, agricultural goods are entering the country from other agricultural countries, specifically places like asia, where it's much easier and and cheaper to produce like, agricultural goods because you barely have to pay the workers there anything. This renders the competition nearly impossible for many local farmers. This is exactly why so many people in the united states today turn against globalization and against free trade. So, eventually, in a competition, like any other competition, someone is bound to lose. If anything, subsidies help our farmers survive so it is unclear to us if it's either our farmers or foreign farmers, why it is not okay to prioritize our farmers. We think that the opposite is true. So, all things considered, please oppose.
We should not subsidize distance education. On our side of this debate, we're going to explain why it's not a good thing to preference distance education over traditional education. We don't think that government should prefer distance education to traditional or in-person education, first, because of the effect that this has on quality, and second, because traditional education actually does much more than just teach the kids who are sitting in the seats. Danny's speech really focuses a lot on access, and while we agree that access is important, we think that access to a bad education is not something that the government should be promoting. Our first point, then, is about how this affects quality. We think that in a world where the government subsidizes distance education, there a few things are going to happen. First, most students are going to learn much less than they would if they had gone to an in-person school. The reason why is that they're not going to have the same interaction with the teacher, they're not going to feel the same pressure to study, they're not going to have the same ability to talk to other students and learn from their peers, and as a result, they're going to learn much less than they would have learned if they had been sitting in a classroom or a lecture hall. But moreover, we tell you that there's now going to be an incentive for governments to close traditional schools. Why? It's very expensive, as danny points out in his speech, to operate a school in a rural or low population density area. For instance, in some parts of the US, students have to take a bus for hours to get to school because they live in such a low density area. Sometimes in developing countries, where there are fewer schools for the number of people, students just don't have access in certain areas that are relatively poor and can't support them without heavy subsidy from the government. But those students are going to lose out on the ability to go to school at all, in person, in danny's world. Why? Well, governments are going to always choose something cheaper, like distance education, over something more expensive but higher quality, like an in-person education. So, on the other side, you're going to see students lose access to in-person education who have it right now and, as a result, lose a high quality education that they would get in the status quo. The last thing I'd like to talk about with reference to quality is that there's no way to verify what students have learned. You don't have a teacher who's able to look at a student's progress in the same way that you do with in-person classes. And although you can administer exams remotely, cheating and things like that are going to be much more common, as we see with the higher rate of cheating on certain exams that are taken at home rather than in school. Our second argument is about why traditional education is more deserving of subsidies, aside from quality. The first is that it actually does much more. The money that goes to letting students attend traditional universities and colleges also funds research and training for future educators. The research that's done at universities is made possible in large part by the money that they bring in by offering a service. While some countries, like the US and britain, have massive government research funds, in other countries, that research is being funded by students' tuition. So if students stopped going to traditional universities, then that research funding dries up and your universities and colleges are going to close and aren't going to be able to provide that research to the same extent that they do today. But we'd also point out that colleges and universities are important training educators. If you want to solve the problem of a shortage of seats in the schools, the answer isn't to get rid of schools, it's to train more teachers. And to do that, you need more people going to university and getting a high quality education, not fewer. So for all of these reasons, we should not subsidize distance education and prefer it to traditional education. Thank you.
We should not fight urbanization. So, in this round, we're going to respond to the arguments made by the government side and explain why we think, overall, despite the hardships that we acknowledge are true for those that move to urban areas, especially in developing nations, we still think that urbanization is overall beneficial for these countries. The first argument that the government makes is that this undermines traditional cultures, oftentimes because these cultures are tied to specific lands or because when you move, for example, to an urban area, you have to learn how to speak the major language in the area and you forget your former languages, etcetera. Look, we think that the argument that people lose their culture is only valuable insofar as people value that culture. So if people choose to abandon their culture, if people don't find it to be strong enough or tied enough to it that they decide to carry it with them, then that is a decision that those people can make for themselves. Despite us, from our western's perspective, standing up on our high horses and saying, " oh, we value all cultures, " it's really the people embedded in those cultures that can make the decision for themselves about whether or not to value that culture to a degree that they need to stay tied to rural areas. We think that people know about the transition costs of moving away from these urban areas and because of that, we think that all of these cultural arguments are ultimately going to be outweighed by the potential for a higher quality of life in urban areas. The second argument that they make is that this type of organization is simply not desirable in that it's not like people are just moving to new york city and getting great jobs, like in developed countries, but that in developing countries, people are moving to areas like karachi or jakarta and moving into slums. We think that moving into a slum region still has benefits over rural areas. But before we say any of that, we think that if it is the case that people are misinformed, we have no argument with informing them, making people more capable of making decisions for themselves about the risks of urbanization. If you're going to expend resources fighting urbanization, we think that you should just instead spend the resources to inform people about the costs and benefits of urbanization and let they make the decisions for themselves. Because, frankly, from the country's perspective, having people concentrated in single areas makes it easier to facilitate resources, makes it easier for economies to develop, and makes it better for those people overall, because those resources that are available in urban areas simply aren't available outside of them. We think that even if you're living in slums, the access to a higher quality wage job means that you can accumulate wealth in a way that wasn't possible in the rural area and means that you have higher future prospects than you otherwise would have had, even if not for you, then for future generations, which we think most people would prefer. The final argument they make is that this leads to poor development, and it pushes the government's priority to urban areas over rural areas, but we think that this is actually a misconstrual of the order of operations. Rather, we think that the fact that urban areas are giving preference in terms of resource allocation is a matter of practicality rather than a matter of of just preferring urban areas. The fact is it's so much easier to facilitate a sewer system, to put the cost into that sewer system, when that sewer system is going to help a highly dense area than it is to go and put in a sewer system for a village that has a population of two hundred people. If you have to expend a similar amount of resources and, especially in developing nations, those resources are limited, the government is always going to give preference to urban areas, despite whether or not we fight urbanization. And because of this, moving to urban areas provides a clear benefit in terms of resource gains to the people that move there. For these reasons, we should not fight urbanization.
We should not adopt teacher tenure reform. So, we think it's important to recognize that certainly while tenure makes it more difficult to fire teachers, it makes it more difficult to bring in new teachers, it gives a lot of benefits to seniority, we think that tenure, ultimately, has the biggest impact in attracting qualified teachers. Because recognize that, in the status quo, teachers are dramatically underpaid. Teachers make the same salary that most people can make in an entry level position in your average corporation. Teachers, while they get some benefits, have increasingly seen those benefits be slashed, have had to take up multiple jobs, there've been a variety of teacher strikes across the united states. It is obvious that these teachers are underpaid and underappreciated. We think that tenure provides some sort of incentive for qualified collegians who are in school to actually consider going into teaching. Because if, and I agree with the government side, if the most important thing in this round is the children's education, I think what matters, then, is saying that you're able to recruit qualified people that are capable of teaching these children as opposed to just getting people that have the bare minimum requirements. And when you look at it in the sense that you need to pay a similar amount for a teaching degree that you do for any other degree in school, and your business degree is going to make you a lot more money than a teaching degree, and so what are the reasons that you would go into teaching? Because you have long-term job security. Because you have certain benefits protected. Because of things like tenure. And we think that if you make tenure less extreme, if you make tenure less beneficial to those that become teachers, then, ultimately, you just see an even greater decrease in the quality of candidates going to be teachers. The first argument that the government side makes directly is that complacency among teachers is incredibly common, and people just don't exert themselves to the full degree once they get older, as you're more senior in the classroom, once you get tenure and you don't need to prove yourself, you just don't go above and beyond as often as you otherwise would. But we think that this is true of most professions but if you actually look at teachers, most of them are passionate about trying to improve their kids' lives, and they want to help kids. Otherwise, they would go find a better-paying job. Like I said, being an average teacher, even with tenure, still doesn't make a lot more money than a job at an average corporation, where you have opportunities for advancement, and better benefits, and higher pay. So most of the people that are teachers aren't just there to collect a paycheck but actually want to do their job and want to do it well. The second argument the government side makes is that tenure makes it hard to remove incompetent teachers. And, so, while this is true to an extent, it's important to recognize that if a teacher is actively bad in the sense that they are: one, not doing their job in teaching the material at all ; two, are actively harmful to their students in some tangible way or do something to their students that actually makes their makes their classroom an unsafe space, there are still ways to get rid of a teacher with tenure, even if it does come with all of the headaches that the government side talks about. But we think that you have to weigh this against getting even fewer qualified teachers in the first place, because for every one teacher that abuses tenure by slacking off in the classroom, there's nine others that work incredibly hard and would only be in that job if would only be in that job because tenure gave them security. Finally, they talk about seniority and how seniority outweighs quality and hard times when you're considering layoffs. This is true, but it also means that those teachers that have been dedicated the longest, that have been spending most of their lives making very little money to do a job that has very little reward are also the ones that are protected. And these are also the people, because of their age, who are least able to move to new career sectors or new get or get new job training, which means that, yes, we actually think it is better that people with seniority in the schools are protected because younger people can go find jobs in other areas, they can move to a different area that's having less economic hardship, or they can move to an entirely different sector much easier than older person could. For these reasons, we should not adopt teacher tenure reform.
The monarchy system is archaic no doubt, and there are plenty of things in it that don't seem natural or rational to us today. One hundred percent true but history and tradition matter to people. Symbolism matters and the abolition of the monarchy especially in today's turbulent times, might lead to a national crisis of identity with pernicious repercussions. Before we turn to argue this, some refutation to the previous speech. So the first thing that we hear about is the dangers in the line of succession. Like queen elizabeth is great and all but who knows how her successors are going to be and how dangerous it is for democracy to have such a like even if it's only in a potential concentration of powers within one family and I assume that this argument is true in a very hypothetical level but in practice it seems that like this concern from abuse of power by the hands of the british monarch isn't a serious one. At the very least it's not more serious than the concern of such a possibility taking place under a constitutional democracy. It's not only that the current royal family is mild mannered and benevolent. It's that the public has become much more aware and critical of what's going on. It's literally impossible to imagine britain slipping into a totalitarian system because it's obvious that once there comes a monarch that tries to deny people the basic rights, or start declaring wars randomly, or breaking parliaments on a whim, he or she will be ousted in a matter of days and monarchs notice moreover, we think that the risk of embarking on a slippery slope that like gradually leads to more and more authoritarianism, is just as relevant if not more relevant to constitutional democracies nowadays. We see the emergence of authoritarian authoritarian leaders in turkey, in hungary, hell even in the united states to an extent. So the proposition from side government doesn't really solve this risk. The second thing that we hear is that there are like it's very costly the monarchy is costly. Well like we say that a lot of leaders in presidential democracies also spend huge sums on sustaining lavish lifestyles and like that's unfortunate but not unique to a monarchy. Eventually we're not talking about unbearable sums to the british economy and either way they are still going to spend a lot of of money on maintaining like the buckingham palace. Even without a monarchy it's not like we're going to demolish it tomorrow. Thirdly they they ask what's the point in a monarchy? Beyond being a tradition, what is the justification? Well if we show that the damage of abolishing the monarchy outweighs the benefits, then for us this is a sufficient justification. So what's going to happen in britain the day after it like the abolition of the monarchy? We haven't heard a word about it from hayah. What's obvious that's going to happen is that a lot of people will be mad. The monarchy is extremely popular today within the british people. We argue that especially now as england faces rising nationalist sentiment that has already led to the colossal mistake that's called breksit, the last thing that we want is to give people further cause to feel that their national identity is under attack. The monarchy is the core tenet of the average british person's national pride. That's what singles out his country from other countries and there's no doubt that abolishing it will provide additional ammunition for a far right populous to come and say look at how these guys in the european union or whatever, want to erase your heritage and force you to give it up and so on and so forth. This means trouble. This means trouble for immigration, for refugees, this means trouble for international trade, for the economy as a whole. Clearly the damage the damages here are way bigger than the existing minor damages that britain suffers from under the status quo of the monarchy. So for all these reasons, please oppose.
The government here is saying two things. First, that the social security system today is ineffective and being run badly and second of all that it's wiser to just allow people to invest their money however they want and tax the wise investments enough to be able to then support everyone in their old age and we say, ladies and gentlemen, that that kind of thinking is a little bit ridiculous and a little bit unrealistic and that's why we need the social security taxes even if it is not as effective as it could be. But here's what we say. First of all, this idea of a regressive system if it is true that it is a regressive system, is if it is true that there are problems in the way the money is being given back out to the people and people are not being given money properly reflective of what they put into the system that is something that can be that can be fixed. We think it is important to reevaluate the system every once in awhile and make sure that we're doing the best job that we can at giving people back appropriate amounts in relation to the investment that was made but what we don't think, ladies and gentlemen, is that we can say well it's unsustainable or we should just allow people to deal with it themselves without recognizing the dire consequences that there are if we do such a thing. Why? First of all, we think that there is a problem with the social security system. We do think that there's a problem sustainability that that we need to look at and we need to fix the way we do things in order to make a better system but it's not as problematic as having to completely support entire generations because they won't have anything at all because what the government is saying is well let's let let let people decide themselves how to invest their money and then will there will be enough in tax dollars to support everyone but that's simply not what's going to happen. When you allow people to do that here's what happens. First of all, you have people who are making excessive amounts of money, large amounts of money, and can invest some of their money and want to invest some of their money. They will be driven to to investments offshore, to untaxed accounts in places like the cayman islands and other and and other places. Why? Because they don't want to have to support an entire generation of people that didn't make as much money as them. Second of all, you you're driving money into poor short term decisions. You're telling people right if you don't if it's not mandatory for people to invest in their future, they're not going to do it. They're going to be investing in vacations, they're going to be investing in fancy cars, they're going to be investing in status symbols and other luxuries that they can afford today rather than investing smartly in their future. Why? For two reasons. One is because people are poor planners. We simply don't think ahead. That's one reason why it needs to be mandatory because people simply don't take that initiative because they think that they'll have enough because they think that they'll make more later on down the line. Well we'll take a vacation this year and we'll start saving next year but when you say that again and again, ladies and gentlemen, it becomes a problem and second of all, because nobody wants to be the patsy. Nobody wants to be the one who makes the wise investment decision and is then taxed up the wazoo to in support people who made poor investment decisions. I'd rather spend the money today, enjoy my money today, and let somebody else take care of me and that's when you get into trouble, ladies and gentlemen. That is exactly where unsustainability becomes an even bigger problem without the social security system. We think that there are problems with social security taxes today. We think that we should be re-evaluating how it is being redistributed. We think that we need to re-evaluate how to make it more and more sustainable. We think that those are very important things that need to be done and need to be done soon but we think that it is far more unsustainable, we think it is far less helpful to abolish the social security tax. We think that canceling it, means that more people are put at risk. We think that when you say well people who make good decisions will be the ones to carry everybody else, nobody wants to be the one to make the decisions. They will either move their money out of the country or they won't invest it wisely. They'll invest it in short term ventures that they can that they can enjoy with their families today and not tomorrow. We think those are far bigger problems than the ones we have today and that's why we should not cancel the social security tax.
We heard from side government some harms that they see in the institute of marriage. But we didn't get a clear definition of what it means, outdated. We understand this to mean something that has no more value. That doesn't serve any valuable function. Therefore we are not going to try and argue that marriage are a perfect problem free institution. But rather that it is still necessary in order to serve a valuable function in society, and therefore it cannot be outdated. Before that, rebuttal. So, the first thing we hear is that marriage leads to less happiness because it's not in our nature to be tied down to a single significant other. Our answer to this is first of all, while there are definitely a lot of people that are in unhappy marriages or that end up divorcing, obviously there are also a lot of people who live in very happy marriages and whose wedding was the most happiest moment of their lives. And so it's very hard to quantifiably determine, like the previous speaker does, that necessarily this brings more unhappiness than happiness. But second of all, we are going to argue that the goal or the function that marriage as an institution serves, has nothing to do with causing happiness. And therefore is independent of like the need for you to to lead happy marriages. Quite the contrary. Marriage is is meant exactly for the moment where things go wrong. The second point of rebuttal is that like they tell us that marriage are lead to the exclusion of certain groups like the LGB LGBT group, and that originally in its roots this institution was oppressive towards women. So as to the first part, we simply don't have to defend the institute in its strictest, traditional form. We agree that all sexual groups need to be included and we think that this institution has evolved, like we've seen in the united states in the past year, and will continue to evolve in order to include more and more groups that have so far been neglected. As to the second part, while it might may be true, again we don't care about the original purpose. We do care about the current function of this institution today and we are going to argue that it does exactly the opposite of depressing or oppressing women. It is what defends them and protect them many times from being oppressed. So what is this valuable function? We say that the institute of marriage protects the weaker side in cases of breakups. In many cases there is asymmetry between between two partners where one party takes upon himself more of the house works and obviously in almost all of the cases we are talking about the woman. Whereas the man gets to specialize in his career and he is the chief provider. Now you could say that this is not okay and the status quo needs to be changed. Then it's oppressive to women. But this is just the reality for many couples. And it actually stems from a very like rational sound economic logic where each side just focuses on where he has the the relative advantage. Anyway we think that the wealth and property that the couple have amassed during the years are products of a mutual effort. And therefore they should belong to both parties equally. However, in effect, what happens is that the men holds ownership over the house, over the car and so on, and in cases of break up he can simply take everything, including of course his high salary and leave the woman without anything. So here marriage play a role as a legal contract that allows the women the the women to get reimbursed. And it allows us as a society to make sure that we are protecting women from these types of situations. Had it not been for the marriage, if the couple will weren't married, then we couldn't have the legal authority to do anything. Therefore marriage are still very very much relevant.
Don't abolish the electoral college. Two main arguments, first on forcing egalitarian campaigning. James is worried about the distribution of people to each electoral college vote, but we actually think it's a good thing that we have a baseline representation even for states that have less people. Because sure people should select the president but we think that the protecting the interests of minority groups is also fundamental to the united states. So we just think that having something like the electoral college is a balance of those two interests: first of having the desired majority represented, but second of protecting the desires of the minority. He says that you can ignore the populace-filled states with the electoral college. Like we just don't think this is the way it works right? Like you still need those votes as a well because they still make up a very large percentage of the overall vote, it's just about whether or not you campaign these other spaces at all. Like it's about whether or not the popular areas eclipse the rural areas to such a large extent that you no longer even care about getting those people to vote for you in the first place. The electoral college keeps large states relevant. There are plenty of states that have very low population density densities but spread those populations over an absurd amount of land: states like wisconsin, nebraska, minnesota. Other states have large urban centers that house millions of people that are often very small in terms of land mass. If we abolish the electoral college there would never be an incentive to campaign in those larger states because politicians could just focus on winning large urban centers and get the popular vote. This is very problematic because while the average special interest of someone from an urban center is similar to someone else from that urban center, they are completely different from people who live in more rural areas and less population dense areas ie people from nebraska probably have a high interest in things like farming subsidies while people from urban centers are more concerned with things like education reform or welfare in the area. We need to make sure that there is an incentive to cater to both groups of people so that it doesn't get massively under covered. We ensure that politicians run national rather than regional campaigns and in this way we make sure that the necessary special desires or special interests of people in rural areas don't just get overlooked to favor putting money into these places that get you elected by urban areas. Our second argument is about providing a definitive win. Majority votes can often have very small margins ie a fifty one to forty nine split. People lose faith in those kinds of splits and it creates political instability and disagreement and that might be good during the process of the election but after the election is over we need to be able to move forward and start being productive. The mandate provided by a decisive electoral college vote allows that transition to occur much more smoothly even if it is partially based in a weak aura of legitimacy. Like we think it's worth it just because it allows for the united states to move forward after a particularly harmful particularly controversial election. James is worried about having recounts within the supreme court. Like first we just think this is really rare. Like with the majority votes you'd still get calls for recounts also because the standard deviation would just be higher. He's worried about the fact that in florida like the you rounding error is two hundred but this just means that on the national level the rounding error becomes two thousand or like something similar in terms of magnitude scale. So we think that he just shifts where the recounts are asked for, he doesn't meaningfully shift whether or not people feel the need to ask for them. But also then he talks about ties and we think that ties are unlikely on both sides of the house. Like they're not impossible without the electoral college either so at the point that he recognizes it is very unlikely with the electoral college we just think this doesn't become like an argument he can win on because of how unlikely it is on both sides of the house. Proud to oppose.
We should not limit the right to self-defense. So, we think that throughout the government's speech, the government misunderstands what it means to limit the right of self-defense. We think that it is not the case that all claims of self-defense are self-defense, and when people act in poor ways and claims it was based on self-defense, the society, the legal system should be able to say, " no, you committed assault, not self-defense, and you will be tried for that assault. " Given that this is the case, we think that the debate really is about in instances when you are at risk, when genuine self-defense is required, you shouldn't be limited in the degree to which you can act on that self-defense, meaning, if you are in harm's way, you should have the right to kill the aggressor. We think that your right to life being violated by another person ultimately gives you the ability, puts you on the high ground to act in the way you see fit. The first argument the government side makes is that violence begets more violence and that a more violent society overall comes and that people are bad at making decisions. First, we think about punishing assault deters this. We think that if people see that claiming self-defense does not mean that they will ultimately get away with something, that you can still have a strong right to self-defense without having people take that too far. They give the example of george zimmerman, but george zimmerman was clearly not acting in self-defense. And just because the legal system did not recognize this doesn't mean that the right to self-defense overall should be removed or should be curtailed. We think that not all claims of self-defense are legitimate, and we're fine to acknowledge that. But we think that on either side of the house, people are going to claim self-defense in instances because of exactly what the government says: people are bad at making decisions. So this is an argument about whether or not legal protection should be afforded to those acting in self-defense, and we think that those legal protections should be incredibly high. When people commit assault, punish them, but this doesn't mean you have to restrict the right to self-defense. They say that this is an umbrella for racist actions and, again, this is a conflation. The government side conflates, time and again, self-defense with all of these other societal issues. Yes, when trayvon martin was killed by george zimmerman, the the legal system, in my opinion, got it wrong. George zimmerman should have been punished, but this doesn't mean that george zimmerman acted in self-defense and therefore he got away, it's that the legal system is corrupt and let him get away with it. On either side of the house, the legal system will likely be corrupted. And this actually brings me to their last argument, which I'll address now, about how this is a gendered right and a privileged right and that therefore we should curtail it so that people with the most privilege shouldn't get this obscene right. But if you think that the system is flawed, then we think that even if you diminish this right to an extent, the people that are actually going to be punished in the system are going to be those people that are already marginalized. This just means that they have even fewer protections than they would have on our side of the house, and the people that are already privileged are probably still going to be seen as acting in a justified manner. To get to their second argument, which I skipped over, they say it's okay for the government to intervene because people make bad decisions in fear, and the state is a better decision-maker. Again, people will make bad decisions on both sides of the house. This is an argument about when people act justifiably, we think that there shouldn't be any sort of limit on what they are allowed to do. We think that in those instances, the right to self-defense must be absolute and for these reasons, we should not limit the right of self-defense.
We should not abolish the american jobs act. In this round were gonna go through and respond to be arguments that the government team makes in proposal for abolishing the american jobs act. So let's go down one by one. The first argument that the government side makes is about opportunity cost. They say that money and federal spending is all fungible, and they talk about how the government at the time of the american jobs act being proposed was able to borrow at zero percent interest rate and that when this is the case, instead of doing what the american jobs act proposed, we should just invest in infrastructure. But we think that at the very beginning the government side is offering a false dichotomy. The american jobs act did include significant amounts of money for infrastructure spending. Fifty billion dollars of the american jobs act proposal was to go towards infrastructure spending. And at the time of the jobs act the recovery required spending in many facets of the economy. Remember, at the time that this was proposed we are in the midst of a recession. Not just infrastructure spending was going to bring up all of the different industries that were affected. When you had unemployment rates of ten to twelve percent, when you add all sectors being impacted by by the recession, we don't think that infrastructure spending alone is a sufficient response to getting people back to work. They say jobs will come about anyway and that infrastructure has long term returns. This is all true, that jobs will eventually return, that infrastructure does have long run returns, all true. But it doesn't account for the fact that while you're waiting for these jobs to magically come about and for the recession to magically, because of market forces, start to lean itself, this has major impacts on the people that are living day to day without jobs, without stable income, without the ability to feed their family. This was an urgent crisis that needed to be responded to in all sectors of the economy and the jobs act was the best and most comprehensive proposal that recognized that obligation from the government. They said the other opportunity cost and trade off is one in political will, and and he gives the example of limited political will that obama had, and if it had passed there wouldn't have been sufficient political will for other things that were controversial like healthcare. Well, we think that we think that because these are in dramatically different parts of the economy, when one has to do with jobs, the other has to do with health care, that as far as public sentiment and public political will, we don't think these two things actually overlap to a significant degree. But the other thing that we would argue is that democrats were determined the pass healthcare. So if we're talking just about the proposal that the government side brings up, we don't actually think that healthcare would have been the major sticking point. Maybe you would have trade offs in the other sectors but we think that when you're talking about the impact of the jobs act and when you're talking about what people prioritize from the government, a healthy economy where people are employed and people are able to live their best lives is one of the top priorities and top obligations that the government has. So even if there is some sort of political trade off we think that that argument can really be applied to anything. There's always a political trade-off. There's always a financial trade off. But when you're talking about the order of obligations that the government has, the obligations to ensure a healthy and adjusted economy for your citizens is right at the top of the list and therefore even if there is a trade off with other options, with other things that the government could be doing, we don't think that those obligations will ever outweigh the obligation that the american jobs act was was addressing. They say finally that it feeds into the the narrative of reckless spending and that this led to republicans winning in the mid terms in twenty in twenty ten and that in twenty twelve there were also big gains that put the present at risk. We think that in times of a recession the president's obligation is not to its party, it's not to his ability to win reelection, it's to the american people. This was a bill that helped the american people. That put money and jobs in the economy and at the end of the day would have been helpful in bringing all sectors back to a stage of recovery. And for these reasons we should not abolish the american jobs act.
According to the government if we allow for open primaries then we're going to have a more moderate candidate chosen and that's not really with the base of the party wants. But let's think about that. First of all maybe it's true that a more moderate candidate will be chosen. But also a candidate who is more likely to win. Because of independence and members of the opposing party are willing to get off their tuchus to vote in the primaries, then they're sure as hell going to vote in the general election as well. Moreover we had this idea on the side of the government that the candidates will moderate during the general election, so we don't have to worry about that. Well here's a thought: why not just vote for somebody who is a more moderate candidate to begin with if that's what the american citizens want, if that's what's going to win the general election? The government's case essentially boils down to, well, we need some private time to cater to the fringe party to the fringe of our party. And we say, no, that's not what the what the primaries are for. The primaries are a time to choose a candidate to run in the democratic general election for the united states of america. And if we can't choose a candidate that's going to be voted in, if we can't find a candidate who is moderate because that's what most people in america want, then we have a problem. If this is the time that you're using just to cater to the fringe of your party, to cater to the extremists, to cater to the people who give you money, we don't think that that's really what the primaries are about. And moreover we don't think that that's what democracy is about. What we say on the side of the opposition is that we definitely should allow for open primaries everywhere. And the key issue that we're going to talk about is the independent vote. Because we constantly bemoan the fact that that there's waning interest in politics, that there's falling voter turnout numbers, that no one's coming, nobody cares anymore, we don't know how to get people out to vote. Well having a partisan system like the one that he that is described the government is part of the problem. It alienates the moderates, it confuses people because of cross over politics, because you have politicians who are more moderate on both sides, because you have some republicans who kind of talk like democrats and you have some democrats who kind of talk like republicans, and people are confused by the system. People don't understand it. People don't want to as was told by the government just join the party or switch parties. Because in general, they might agree with a lot of things that are being said on one side. Because in general maybe over the years they generally do agree with being a republican or democrat. But there's a specific candidate that they want to support on the other side. But there's a specific election where they think that there's something very important to support on the other side. For example, african american republicans who voted who supported obama in the in in the elections because they felt it was very important to promote a the first black president. We think that that's okay. We don't think that we should necessarily try and entrench ourselves in partisan politics the way that the government is trying to make us do. We think, ladies and gentlemen, that when you have open primaries it's at step in the general it's a step in the right direction towards democracy going back to the people. Towards people being becoming more active again in politics. It sends the following message: it says yes, there are two major parties, but independence and crossover voting is allowed. The parties which have ruled the united states for centuries are open to new supporters. We're open even to temporary supporters. We're opening to hearing what the with the people of america really want and how to better serve them. Because of at the end of the day, even the governments says well all of the candidates are going to moderate. Then we have to think to ourselves, maybe there's something wrong with the system. If we encourage more people to come and vote in the primaries and we chose more suitable candidates to begin with, perhaps we'll have a better system altogether. Perhaps we'll have a better democratic system that brings the power back to the people, that excites people again and gets them off their tuchuses, off their couches and into the polling stations.
Don't ban factory farming. Two main arguments, first on why it is preferable economically. Yes sam is right. It increases the profit of corporations, but we don't think that the most important impact is that, right? First we think that one of the most important parts that factory farming creates in society is that it keeps food prices low. This is very important because food is fundamental to human life and productivity. Food insecurity is already a really big problem in the united states especially in low income areas or food deserts in other countries because you have swathes of the population that really struggle with affording food and there a lot of foods that often get artificially raised in price because you have movements that advocate for organic or non-commercial farming or any number of other things. When you can't grow as much food for the same plot of land the price of every individual item of food increases to make up for it. And this is really problematic because when you can't produce food at a cheaper cost it then transfers on to the consumers being able to afford more options. This is literally the most important thing in this debate because we want people to be able to afford to eat otherwise they will literally not be able to do anything else with their lives. Insofar as government policy has to impact the individual and has to be obligated to help their own citizens first, we think that that obligation exists to the people much more than it exists to animals and animal farming industrially like factory farming will help people a lot. Second under this though, factory farming creates jobs, more jobs in factory farming than if that was replaced with smaller farms. So maybe there are human rights violations in these jobs as sam says but we think that's something that we can address through labor laws. It is more important to prioritize those jobs existing at all. Sam is worried about the hormones that factory farms use like that doesn't go away with factory farms going away right? Like small farms also often use hormones. These these things are non-unique from each other. Our second argument is about why there aren't any animal rights. We don't think that humans have any particular obligation to protect animal rights. In the wild, animals eat each other and hurt each other without any regard for the life of the other being and if faced with a human while hungry they wouldn't pause before eating them. And if they have the ability to grow many humans or other animals so that eating would be easier that is definitively something that animals would do. It is unclear why humans should extend protections to these animals that don't extend protections to each other. Moreover we just think that human rights outweigh even if animals have rights. First because the government is making the decisions of the ban and the government has obligations their citizens first insofar as those citizens do things like pay taxes. But also insofar as the government significantly limits citizen rights in order to like have control over them. They can say that they're going to provide for them so that trade-off has to exist. Like the government has to protect citizens first. But also because humans are just going to live for a longer and have more developed consciousness, so their suffering is going to impact them more and should matter more in the span of this kind of debate. Proud to oppose.
It's funny to hear the previous speaker talk about, how the right to self defense derives from the right to life that should be absolute, and then, the next thing he does, is move on to explain why as soon as somebody threatens me, no matter the the circumstances, it is completely okay for me to kill him, meaning to harm his right to life. There is a reason, that government's side is contradicting itself, and that is, that there is a categorical fallacy in the concept of absolute rights. My constructive point is going to be on why there isn't and cannot be such a thing as absolute rights, before that, let's address the things that james has said in his speech. First, he talks about facilitation of rights, and he says that if there is any right that is absolute, then this requires the right to life to be absolute, and then, as an extension, the right to self defense. Our answer is, as one can expect, that indeed no right is absolute. Even james, james' right to life, which he talks about, isn't truly absolute. Take for example, the fact that the country can demand from its soldiers to risk their lives for the state. We'll talk more about that on the constructive. Next, he goes out against the idea of a proportional response. In this he says two things: a, I can never know the true intentions of the person that attacks me, therefore if someone threatens me, then any type of reaction that is meant to remove that this threat is justified, and b, no external person that, hasn't been in my shoes in that situation, could ever understand, therefore not criticize the way in which I acted. Let's answer these one after another. A, if, even if you cannot know for certain the intent of the person that attacks you, you are not completely without information. You could still assess how much of an ability this person has to harm you. For instance, does he have a weapon or not? Is he stronger than you? Or that, or is it someone harmless? As, at best, this would be a reason to allow a judge a little bit of leeway, in judging the situation, but surely, this does not mean that we should, like, that this is a reason to refrain from this case ever reaching a court. Let's answer b. I'm pretty certain that james himself understands the huge problem problem that his logic creates. He he essentially endorses a situation, in which every type of cas is based, is is judged based on the subjective feeling of the person it involved, and no, and not based on an objective, unified standard. Unlike what james said, this is of course unprecedented in the legal system, for the simple reason that, it creates a situation in which any type of action can be justified, they can simply say that like, I can simply kill everyone that ever raises his voice on me, and government's logic would completely be valid here. But, the truth is that we need'nt go so far, because all we have to do is look at the recent cases of of police officers shooting suspects, without ever thinking twice, even if they are unarmed, because they enjoy the like, over-consideration of the courts in their subjective feelings. Lastly, that he says that this is a natural right, and this is an absurd argument, because in nature people were free to do a lot of things, that we don't allow them today in a civilized society. So, let's move on to our constructive. Why there isn't and cannot be absolute rights? When we talk about absolute rights, we talk about something that no one can ever justifiably take away from you, no matter what happens. In fact, we believe that the very definition of the term right means that they cannot be absolute. Why? Because rights tend to clash with one another, you have the freedom of movement, but you cannot move yourself into another person's home, because his right to property trumps your right to move. You have the freedom of speech, but you cannot scream death to x, because x's right to security trumps your rights of speech. If everyone had absolute rights, we would have no way of solving these clashes. We could not limit one person's right, and therefore he could harm other people's rights. When everyone has absolute rights in theory, no one has this right in practice, please oppose.
Obviously the legal system isn't perfect and is incapable of always delivering justice purely. It will never be able to do that. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't try and maximize the justice in pursuit of truth, but we have to understand that there is a very dangerous tradeoff here: that the more power, the more absolute power we grant the state in pursuing truth and justice, the more chances of creating greater injustice. This is why the system is built in such a way that limits the power of the government and the state out of the understanding that this asymmetry in powers can create a distortion and allow people in positions of power to do almost everything they wish. This is why we don't allow evidence that were unlawfully obtained to be submitted in the court, even if they might help us reveal the truth. This is also why we limit the ability of the state to put its citizens in double jeopardy. And yes, this means that in some cases we will not be able to catch bad guys, but that's simply worth the risk. We need to say, though, that there are very few cases, in reality, of guilty defendants that are able to beat the system and get fully acquitted. Everyone can cite the names of OJ simpson or bill cosby, but it's exactly because these are such rare instances that they became so famous. How do I know this? Because the national conviction rate in criminal felonies is above ninety percent, well above it. This means that it's incredibly rare, next to impossible, to avoid conviction once charges have been pressed against you. No matter how good your lawyer is, chances are against the defendant. Do we really think that ninety something percent of defendants are guilty people? I doubt that. Given this, it is really unclear to me what is this so pressing problem that side government sees in the status quo that would require such a drastic amendment to one of the core tenets of the constitution and would require granting more power to the already too powerful public prosecution. We hear that it does more harm to allow guilty men walk around free than to judge and try innocent men twice. We disagree. We disagree, both because we really don't accept this assumption that if you are truly innocent, then it's likely that you'll be found so a second time because as rachel says, the system is flawed. It's far from being perfect in pursuing truth. So, in the second time or third time or fourth time, at some point, people break. They no longer have the time or the money or the strength to keep on fighting for their innocence, and the state will always have much more stamina and resources to continue fighting. So, once the state sets its aim on convicting someone, they can simply never rest until they manage to do so. We also, though, we like regardless of whether you're innocent or not, we we still disagree with this claim. We think that it's truly morally unjust when a criminal walks around free if he was never caught and put on trial. But given that we have caught this man, and we have tried him and we were simply unable to convict him for whatever reason, then the system did all that it could. It doesn't mean that it's good that he now walks around in the street but this is not also not a violation of rights, as rachel would have you believe. Meanwhile, we say that putting people through the entire process of a criminal trial, where your name and your reputation are smeared, your career is over, your family life, your social life gets hurt badly, you were forced to spend a fortune and after winning, you would have to face all of this again, in our opinion this is a grave injustice, and this is amoral, you know what, even if you are guilty. And then rachel says that people will start losing trust in the system and will start breaking laws when they see that the system is unable to catch and lock up the bad guys. So the first answer here is this is the classic example of a slippery slope. We would love to hear one example in which chaos and crime hit the streets due to double jeopardy. People don't abandon so quickly the concept of the rule of law and just take matters in their own hands. I know that this is an argument that we sometimes like to say in debateland, but it's simply untrue. The system is deeply ingrained in our consciousness. Most people cannot imagine a world without a country or the courts or the rule of law. Second answer here is that if anything can create a public panic is to see that the criminal system harasses people who were already found innocent once and retries them over and over. People can say to themselves, " jesus, this man's life is ruined now, and it could have just as easily been me. " If anything, that's the kind of thing that could turn people much more wary and suspicious towards the authorities. So for all of these reasons, we are very proud to oppose.
Medicare, medicaid, free health clinics run as charities, low cost health clinics, clinics such as the ones run by pharmacies, and ER and emergency rooms at hospitals. These are all available in the united states. No one is turned away from an emergency room. Nobody is not treated. Nobody is many people are covered by medicare and medicaid. Many people can afford to go to the and of course everyone go to a free health clinic to get checkups. Not to mention the the availability of private healthcare. These provide a huge net of health security for the entire population in the united states as a whole. And as opposed to what the government tries to lead us to believe, even under a private healthcare under a nationalized healthcare system, no one is guaranteed access to all treatments that they may need. That's simply not possible, it's not realistic, it doesn't happen in any of the nationalized health systems around the world. There are always going to be drugs that are simply too expensive, that are not included in in the basket of medicines covered by a nationalized health insurance. So it's easy to demand universal healthcare and say, well how can we deny medical attention to human beings, human rights, human rights, human rights. But the fact is first of all health care is not being denied. Certain levels of health care are being denied to certain people who can't afford it and don't fall into medicare and medicaid standards. That is true. Being denied by specific doctors of course, but there are other places that fill in that need. Second of all, health care is not free even if the government provides it, and that is something that the government tends to forget. Healthcare is not free. If we universalize healthcare, if we hand it out to everyone, that means that we are taking the money from somewhere and that means rises in taxes. That means that you're going to pay more taxes on products that you buy, it means you're going to pay more taxes at the end of the day on your salaries, we think that it puts a heavy burden on the entire population and that money is often used, shall we say, unwisely. By by by bureaucracies run by governments. We think that a lot of that money will be lost and we we will end up as a nation spending far more money on healthcare than we do today. But third and most importantly, is that the cost of universal healthcare goes far beyond the monetary value of it, right? The research and development of drugs and treatments costs more money than we can possibly imagine. And nationalizing healthcare impacts this industry greatly. And the problem is that there's going to be far less money and far less incentive to develop new drugs and treatments if we nationalize healthcare. One of the reasons that countries around the world outside of the united states can afford nationalized healthcare, afford it on a metaphorical level, is because they rely on the drugs and treatment methods developed by the free market in the united states and that develop because of the incentives involved in developing these drugs and treatments in the united states. So if we introduce universal health care in the united states, in essence we would be denying proper medical treatment to millions of people around the world not only in the united states. It means that the that the level of care that everyone gets around the world and in the united states is going to be far lower. We think ladies and gentlemen that it makes more sense to have all the different layers of security that we have in the united states but to still allow a free market to reign. We think that it makes more sense to encourage and incentivize people and companies to give health care to their to their employees than to have people purchase their own healthcare. We think that those are good things. We think that having certain safety nets for people who simply can't afford it is of course important, we do have medicare, we do have medicaid. It is possible that it's time to tweak the standards and to tweak who has access to it or not. We think the free health clinics fill a huge need and that there's no problem with relying partially on charities that do this kind of work. We think that low costs health clinics exist, we think that overall everybody gains more when we have privatized healthcare. Think you.
We shouldn't disband the united nations. A lot of james' issues are mechanical. He doesn't like the voting structure, he doesn't like the national security council. We're down for reforms in the UN, but this is probably not a reason to abolish the united nations entirely just because you have some problems with the general voting structure. Like we think there are reforms that can take place like creating more egalitarian voting or abolishing the national security council specifically. And these kinds of things would probably get to the benefits that james wants without getting rid of something that we think is on net beneficial generally. Like I think the problem massively with james' advocacy is that he doesn't actually point out a way in which the united nations is harmful. He just talks about the ways in which it might be ineffective, but if we show you that there are some side benefits even with a massively ineffective body we still win this round. Two main arguments, first on the way in which it promotes international collaboration. Recognize that there are very few spheres in which you get multiple countries interfacing on a regular basis. The united nations might have downsides and issues with efficacy, but it facilitates a regular coming together of these nations which in itself we think is ridiculously beneficial. It allows groups to ease tensions, show citizens in nations that we are capable of collaboration in the first place, reminds countries that working together accrues benefits, and provides opportunities for interaction that doesn't require one country to reach out first and worry about potential PR and image related issues. This in itself wins the round because if we show you that there are side benefits to having a body and simply brings these countries together, as long as there aren't active harms then it is worth it. James is worried about illiberal countries on the on the united nations. Like okay so maybe we're shackled with action against these countries. Like maybe we don't get to criticize china enough but this doesn't mean that we shouldn't be calling out the other nations that the united nations does take action against, right? Like just because some things are off limits that shouldn't be doesn't mean the nations that we do take actions against don't deserve that. So we just don't think this is a voting issue in this round. At most it is just a potential flaw of the UN. Our second argument is about promoting accountability. James says that the UN is ineffective. Like okay but that doesn't mean that it has a negative impact. So the fact that it does things like fund UNESCO etcetera plays for our side of the house. James says that he wants those bodies to exist outside of the united nations, but doesn't tell us how he's planning on getting them funded. We think that what the united nations does very well is that it establishes already agreed upon and already known funding mechanisms that allow for these beneficial organizations to exist in the first place. So if you were to get rid of the united nations, even if UNESCO continued to exist in theory, it is incredibly unlikely that you would actually be able to get funding into it. Especially since the massive reason that a lot of these larger powers like the united states, like china are willing to pour money into the united nations at all is because they know that they get to be active members and large voting blocks. So once you take away that it was almost certain that you're not going to get funding for the things that james wants it for. Moreover without bodies like the united nations, it is very easy for countries that are doing problematic or shitty things just slide under the public eye because there isn't enough broad attention paid to what is going on. So like maybe their neighboring countries have a problem with it but no one is really informing other countries or making them care about it such that you can get a coalition acting against them. The united nations is a sphere where human rights offenses can be highlighted even if some of them are still overlooked. And even if there isn't amazing enforcement it least creates awareness that allows individual countries to take actions and create coalitions that shame and can do things like refuse to trade or boycott these nations. This is always preferable to the alternative, which is basically complete inaction. Proud to oppose.
Don't end water fluoridation. Tim spends a while talking about government legitimacy. And it might be true that actions need to be democratically taken, but we don't think it's the case that this means that people have to have an individual voice and actual policy. Rather, we think the reason that we are democratic, as in representatively democratic and not an absolute democracy, is because we recognize that you have to sacrifice some amount of democracy in order to maintain efficacy and to make up for the fact that when you have large populations of people that simply weren't possible in the like long history, where maybe greece had a small enough population to have an absolute democracy, in the status quo, individuals simply do not have the time or the interest to keep up on policy enough to even know what is best for them. So, insofar as we democratically elect our representatives with the understanding that they will then go on to act in our best interest, and we elected them because we trusted them, we think it is thus democratic that any policies they pass, unless they later get recalled because democracy was so upset about it, are fine and aren't, on a principled level, undemocratic or problematic. Our entire democracy is based on people understanding that the average person doesn't necessarily know what is best for them scientifically or politically, so they choose people who are more informed, understanding that even if the policy is unpopular, the person has a reason for choosing it. Two main arguments in favor of fluoridation, the first is that it is harmless. First, we think that people do still have a choice. So when tim waxes poetically about how you're taking away the ability of people to choose whether their water is fluoridated or not, it is the case that you can buy unfluoridated water at any kind of store that you go into. However, it is not the case that you can buy fluoridated water at any store, only that you can get the unfluoridated version. So we think that actually it is their side of the house that removes options from individuals, because you remove the option to get fluoridated water at all. But also, by tim's reasoning, all laws are undemocratic, because we don't reexamine them every time a new generation are born. Like, of course, there are decisions that are made in the past that perhaps are less popular with the current voting populace, but that doesn't mean that we change them if there's no real uproar, which there hasn't been for fluoridation. Fluoridation doesn't hurt anyone, the science is very concrete, and the only person the only people who tend not to want fluoridation are rich, very very entitled and kind of privileged soccer moms who have enough money to pay for their own private water if that's what they'd prefer. We think that what matters in this round is those who are poor and can't afford regular teeth care, who do appreciate fluoridation. Our second argument is about it being beneficial to society. We think this is objectively true. Like tim pretends that fluoridation is this unnecessary thing, and people can just take care of their teeth independently, but this is a misunderstanding of how much effort actually goes into regular care of like your teeth and oral health. Like, first, we think that when something goes wrong in your mouth, this is something that translates to the entire rest of the human body. Like having a cavity also instantly affects your hearing and how much your head hurts over time, and it can also do things like transfer bacteria into your bloodstream. And we also just think that oral health care is really expensive. Like many people don't have health insurance, and it's really hard to go through for things like regular cleanings or even take care of cavities once they start. So we think this is actually a really good preventative measure because it takes care of the fact that for a lot of people, people aren't brushing their teeth correctly. They're not going to the dentist regularly enough. And even though fluoridation won't solve all of that, it is a good step in the proper direction of at least having some kind of preventative cure. It would be like if we could have antioxidants in all of our water. That would probably be a good thing, even if it is not something we necessarily ask for, because regular antioxidants tend to be a little bit expensive and maybe not something that the average person thinks about. So we think that, if anything, this is just another way for the government to take care of their population. Proud to oppose.
One thing that's crucial to understand, retirement age is not mandatory. Retirement age is the age at which an individual can decide to retire. Why is this important? Because the money you get in retirement, it's not great for most people, it's not a ton of money. Most people would prefer being able to live on more, that means, most people, given the ability to, choose to continue working unless they've saved up enough personal wealth in order to retire comfortably. Why does that matter? Because it means generally speaking, those retiring are those who need to. If yaar wants a good way to calculate who it is who no longer can work, those who choose to retire are a generally pretty good calculation, that's important to keep in mind. Two arguments here. One, the proposition is looking at the problem entirely wrong. Kicking out old people and replacing them with young people does not add jobs to the market, it just replaces who holds them. Secondly, we say it also creates a massive harm to the market. By a time and place factor an in in the economy and in child rearing. Simply put, we think raising the retirement age, means young people get into better jobs older because their predecessors hold onto the jobs for longer. This means they come into money later and this lowers the likelihood of them venturing out on their own, and raises the likelihood of them postponing having children. Three points of rebuttal before that. One, yaar says, once you retire you start getting your pension and that's too much money for the state to uphold. Two responses. One, at least at first, this is your money, it's the money you've paid into pension, it is not a state burden to hold in. It is possible that you're taking it for too long, and that part stayed on the state for a while to some extent, but recognize that, mostly this is money you put into the system. Secondly, if it is true that you've retired in order for somebody else to take your job, that means that somewhere on down the line there is somebody who until now was unemployed who has now taken your job. Note that, until that point, that person was being paid unemployment. If you don't retire, that person continues to be paid unemployment. That means the money's coming out one way or another. Secondly yaar says, look, there's optimal data configuration that we need to take into account. He mentions population size but he doesn't really address it. A, it is untrue that it is decreasing recently in most places, most places still have an increase. And, b, yaar's logic says that the system was planned a hundred years ago. Even if it has recently begun decreasing, certainly it's more than it was a hundred years ago, the logic should still stand that there's a population increase. This means the problem is still a macro market problem of more people than there is labor. Lastly he says, some old people get disappointed, blah blah, fine, that's the the least of our problems, let's talk looking their problem entirely wrong. Look, the main problem that we have is that there are people, and those people don't have jobs. This is a simple math problem. There are more individuals who want to work than there are jobs. Why does yaar hurt this. One, he increases drastically the number of individuals who want to work by expanding the age range at which you work. This means fewer jobs per person AKA higher unemployment, or rather higher youth unemployment. Note that the job ratio doesn't shift when you increase it that. What does this mean? It means that the job unemployment moves down the ladder from older people to younger generations. How does that get hurt? Two things hurt the inability to have jobs. One, a lack of people opening businesses. We say people are more likely to open businesses when they've gained enough capital on their own. That's why you normally see people opening businesses at thirty or forty when they've gained some personal capital and some job market experience. We say that experience gets lowered when they have to wait longer in order to wait to enter the job market. So you're harming the economy more by having people work older. For those reasons, please oppose.
The government's speech boils down to the fact that they want to change the incentives of political parties and have them appeal to new people, and they want to solve voter apathy. The problem is they don't really do either of those things. And the other problem, ladies and gentleman, with this issue of like: " let's change the incentives of political parties " what a silly way to solve this problem. Right? They say to themselves: " how can we get rich white guys to be more appealing to young poor black guys? " Well here's a better question: why don't we, instead of getting the rich white guys to be more appealing, why don't we just get more young poor black guys involved in politics? Right? That would be a much more, that would be a much better and more real change that can and should be meeting countries like the united states. So for example, policy changes that would make it easier for poor people to run for elections. Right? By doing things like limiting the amounts of money you can spend on your campaign. That would be of real change in politics that would allow real people who actually care about these issues to run and make the changes, and have more people involved in politics and actually get interested in politics and get people excited about politics again, as opposed to just saying like: " hey let's get this rich old white guy " like the same political figures to like turn to these new populations. Which we don't think that they're going to do anyways, for a number of reasons. Not least of which is the electoral college system in the united states which is going to lead to a backlash about this policy and people being very upset about this policy, but no actual change in in like who politicians are turning to, because they know where their voter base is. They know where they tend to win, they know where the votes are. Then we heard this idea of like voter apathy. Right? We're going to solve it. You don't solve voter apathy by by threatening somebody with a fine or jail time. Right? That's not how you solve voter apathy. You're not more likely to get involved in politics for threatened with a fine or jail time, you're just more likely to go stick any ballot in the box. Right? You go grab the first one that you see. Or, even more likely or and even worse, is you're going to and you're gonna see a lot more novelty voting. Right? People who write jed bartlet for president on their ballot, are people who stuff fifteen ballots into their, into their envelope, or people who put in blank ballots, or people who put in ballots for the party that they think has the funniest name or the funniest platform. So in countries that have a multi-party system, for example israel, you're going to get a lot of votes for for novelty parties such as the green party, whose entire platform is based on promoting the legalization of marijuana. Not that there's anything wrong with that being a party platform or being a policy platform or or being a policy that people believe in, but when you get but when you force people to vote and you get huge swaths of the population who think that it's a big joke, or who are angry at the government for forcing them to go and vote, you're gonna get a lot of votes like that which doesn't necessarily reflect the true will of the people either. So I think that you get disproportionate power for small for small interest groups rather than a better representative government. More than that, ladies and gentlemen, we think that you violate the freedom of speech by compelling people to speak. We think that you have a right to vote but not a duty to vote and we think that that's a big difference. Right? You can choose to vote you can choose not to vote. And the fact is, ladies and gentleman, that the non vote should be enough of a vote for us. It gives us a lot of information. It gives the governing parties a lot of information. It means anybody who truly cares about changing the country that they live in, who truly cares about politics will look to those people and say: " why aren't they voting? " Right? When you had barack obama, for example, who when he ran for president, you did get a lot of people who in the past it and vote, and he appealed to them. He cared about them and he looked at the people who weren't voting and said I want to appeal to them. We think that that's a a good idea. We think that the information that you get from having a non vote from every election being told this is the number of people who just didn't care enough to go out to the to the polls. We think that that information is crucial and valuable to the government. Its people telling them that they want to change the political system. For example, change it away from the electoral college, where people feel that the votes are being wasted. We think that it tells people that they're disillusioned with politics and that they need to change their ways. We think that there are better ways to solve the problem of apathy rather than this. Thank you.
The summer break isn't intended to strengthen the state's educational grip over young minds. It's intended to weaken it and enable outside forces to penetrate the educational mind of that child as well. One argument in this debate. Government has a monopoly over education. They do not deserve this monopoly, they should not maintain this monopoly. Parents have a right to educate their children and three months out of the year where they get to do this is a wonderful thing that we shouldn't get rid of. Three points of refutation before we start: one, we're told students forget over the summer and it's a waste of time to have to re-teach them everything. So two things: a, the assumption that they're not going to forget over the two week vacation alternative that is being proposed to us seems kind of strange particularly because the speaker then goes on to analyze that somethings you forget if you don't practice every single day. By that rationale, as it is you're going to have to re-teach things then it seems on their side of the house you're going to have to re-teach them more frequently therefore waste more time. But we think that re-teaching things or at least re-teaching things once is not a bad use of time. They're gonna leave school at some point, they're going to forget at some point and the act of relearning something means it's better recalled the next time around. Though it's not just that you now remembered again but now you remember in a deeper and more meaningful way because it has been learnt and relearnt. We think that means it's a good educational tool AKA not a waste of school time. Secondly, he speaks about avoiding burnout. Look, they have a weekend break every week already. We think burn out is not a particular issue with the system, not the system they propose. We think that's fine, but also not the system that exists. We don't think burnout happens on our side of the house. Thirdly, he says, he talks about parents and he says poor parents need to spend more money on daycare and food. So one, were really happy to subsidize this. That seems trivial. Two, you have to compare this to two weeks every two months, right? This way, there's one summer camp that they can send their kids to and that summer camp, because it's organized and has people for the summer, can charge less money. But when it's every two weeks out of a month, you're gonna end up having parents who have no choice but to stay at home instead of going to work because nobody else can watch their kids for a sporadic two weeks every two months. We think it gets much worse on their side of the house. We would note that they're not offering substantially less vacation time, just substantially more dispersed vacation time. Lastly, we think this is an effective that that they can put this time to effective use which brings me into my argument. Right now, governments get to teach kids nine months out of the year. They give them back for three. What can happen during those three months? Parents can send their kids to space camp where their kids can discover a love of science, they can send their kids to math camp where can they can discover that math isn't just the way it's taught to the dumbest kids in class. It's something more, it's something beautiful. Conversely, they can send their kids to art camp where they can learn that art is a thing or that or to music camp. Crucially, we think these camps are available to everyone in society including the lowest echelons because they are a necessity and necessities create markets even for the lowest paying income families. If not, we're happy to subsidize it. What does all this mean? It means you have three months of time where kids continue to study but they study things that are it on a government subsidized a a a government sanctioned curriculum. They expand their horizons and they break the monopoly that the government has over brainwashing children, allowing parental influence. Why is that so crucial? One, the parents are responsible for the kid these kids and so have a right to their education. Two, we fear government having too much power over the educational abilities of children, and three the parents are dependent on these children in the future and should so should have a right to shape their future. Please allow parents to continue educating their children at least some of the time. This doesn't become possible with two weeks at a time, it does become possible with two months at a time. Please oppose.
Don't exploit small modular reactors. Two main arguments, first on the high risk of meltdown. Many nuclear fission reactions reactors are equally dangerous to full-on plants, but now you're just going to have significantly more of them and they might be of slightly smaller size. This is actually incredibly problematic because in the status quo when you have one nuclear power plant and it serves basically the majority of a country because it is often times very risky to have more than that in one nation, so we see that currently in the united states there's only like two or three maximum nuclear reactors we see that even then we oftentimes do have mistakes. Like see things like chernobyl or the japan meltdown or even our very own like three mile island meltdown. Like all of these things occur not because people don't care or aren't working, it's because these fission reactors are really high risk and really easily set off and really easily become a security threat. So when you increase the amount and just like put them everywhere, we think you're going to have an even more difficult time making sure that everything is secure but also that every little meltdown is just going to affect an infinitely larger region right? Because even if the size of the reactor is smaller, the fact that any like radiation can just be blown up and down the country with the winds means that you're going to be affecting infinitely more space when even one of these breaks down than if you had like just one nuclear reactor that sits in one particular area that is less likely to break down than having a million of them but when it does can be more easily contained because you don't have so many all over the place. Look even large incredibly secure isolated power plants are very dangerous to the point that we don't use nuclear energy just because the harms of any sort of meltdown or security breach are so high. So when james wants to put these all over the country in tons of places, this is just probability wise going to have a higher risk of meltdown. It also just means that oversight is going to be really stretched thin so response to upkeep and breaks will be much shorter and less wholistic. These rural and isolated areas that james is worried about are also the most prone to things like earthquakes, snowstorms, etcetera and it means that it'll be harder to access these modulators for upkeep in response to a crisis will be severely limited by location. Our second argument is about the false sense of solvency. Nuclear energy is significantly dirtier than any other type of energy that drew lists like water power, solar power, or geothermal. It produces incredibly harmful radioactive waste and uses very dangerous radioactive ingredients. At least one form of greener energy will work for any isolated or rural area that james can come up with. We should focus on increasing those instead of pretending to solve the problem of small modular reactors. James talks about developing nations. We think this is actually the group for which small modulator reactors will never work because they're significantly more expensive than things like solar panners panels and also significantly more dangerous. And this means that developing nations can't afford them or their upkeep. So he's not actually going to help the groups that he says this is most useful for. It would be better input of energy to just say let's raise the number of windmills because they go high up so even areas that have low wind can still generate power. Or let's have more solar power panels which are literally guaranteed to work every day during the day so the only countries where it wouldn't work would be like in the very north where you have very short days to no days and there we could do things like water power or solar power instead. So we just think that given that there's already a green energy type that can suit the specific needs of basically any area, we don't understand why we should be deferring to small modular reactors when they are so much more dangerous. Proud to oppose.
Organ donation should not be mandatory. In my speech, I'm going to, first, tell you about why this would be a rights violation, and I'm going to clash here directly with what sam tells you about maintaining people's rights, and secondly, I'm going to talk to you about why there are better ways to meet demand that would actually get the end sam tells you about without the abuses that would occur as a result of mandatory organ donation. So, first, why is this a rights violation? We would tell you, first of all, that this violates people's right to freedom of religion. The reason that this is the case is because many religions require that people be buried intact, so to speak, without having doctors cut open the body after death. We think that for those religions, it would be a great offense to have the government require that everybody not live up to those burial standards. We think that because in the united states and many other western countries, there are laws that prohibit discrimination against any religious group, for instance, religion is a protected class in the US, that, therefore, this policy would probably not stand up to scrutiny in the supreme court or in other jurisdictions. Because of this violation to religious freedom, we don't think this policy is acceptable. Next, we want to talk about personal autonomy. Sam tells you that people don't have any rights to their bodies after they die and that families don't have any right to inheritance, but we actually do think that families have some rights in the form of their own right to closure and to know what has happened to their loved one. We see that states spend a huge amount of money to return bodies of people who die abroad to ensure that people have funerals, even if they die without any money. So, clearly, governments see that they have some obligation to families. And we think that given that, it would be inconsistent with the principles of society as a whole to require organ donation when it would be traumatic to these families. Moreover, these families are already going through an extremely difficult part of their lives, given that they just lost a loved one, and we think that it would be wrong for the state to basically victimize them at the point in their lives when they're the most vulnerable. And lastly, sam tries to make this weird utilitarian argument that it's better to give people organs than it is to allow people to have solace after a family member's death, but we don't actually think that he gives any evidence to explain why this is true. It's just an assertion. After all, at the end of the day, what is good, what is not, we just don't think utility actually makes a lot of sense as an ethical framework, particularly in this debate when there are many different parties to consider. Our second argument is that there are better ways to meet the demand for organs. Sam correctly identifies a problem that there are an insufficient number of organs available relative to the demand for healthy organs, but we think that there are better ways to meet this demand. You could, for instance, create incentives for people to donate their organs. One way this can work might be to require people to sign up to be organ donors in order to receive certain government benefits or to receive a free funeral. On the other hand, you might also have a program that makes a payout to a family if someone is an organ donor, almost like a life insurance policy, or you could do something that we've all advocated for many times before, debating at IBM, and allow people to sell their organs. We think that if there was a legal organ marketplace, that many wealthy people would choose to buy organs on this market, which would free up the available free organs for those who can't afford to pay and that this would dramatically increase the supply of organs while also maintaining consent from the people who give them up. On our side, we've shown you that you can meet the need for organs, while also respecting the wishes of the deceased and, therefore, I think it's clear that we're going to win this debate. You're going to vote for opposition because we better uphold individual people's freedoms and because we better solve the problem sam brings up. For all these reasons, organ donation should not be mandatory. Thank you.
What side government are telling you, is that there's a group of people, who hold a belief which is not particularly rooted in science, and that belief puts dietary restrictions on these individuals. To us, this sounds like religion. Two things we're going to talk to you about in this debate: one, naturalism as religion, and the right to maintain your religious values, and two, on comparative benefits of natural food. Three points of rebuttal before that. One, they say they don't use pesticide, so likely people will get sick. A, organic food uses organic pesticides, sometimes less effective, often, as effective as regular pesticides. B, we have no problem with testing this food before it's allowed in the supermarket. So, if I'm an organic farmer, and I grew a batch of whatever, and I send it off to trader joe's to be sold from there, trader joe's should be forced to test it before putting it up for sale. This is not a reason for a blanket ban on selling organic food. Lastly, note that an individual can be aware of this added risk. Given that, part of the reason they're not consuming this regular food in the first place is because of the pesticides, they ought be aware that there aren't use of pesticides in the organic food, that means that even if they are eating the food, in spite of a risk, they are doing so in a calculated manner and that is each individual's right to do. Secondly, he says this stuff goes goes bad because they don't use preservatives, and that's a problem. Look, so does milk, OK? Unless you're going to ban all dairy products from supermarkets, you have to recognize that this is inconsistent logic. Lastly, they say there is long term benefits that are dependent on facilities, whatever that means. Look, we have no idea why that's true that the long term benefits of organic food are dependent on facilities, but it seems someone over in side government has recognized a type of organic farming facility, which could indeed create long term benefits. It seems then, that the problem is that not all facilities act in that way. It seems then, that what government action should be taken in order to do, is ensure that the organic label is given only to facilities which act in that manner, therefore creating a situation, in which they all act in a way, which gives us the long term benefits, not banning all organic food. Two points, one, on naturalism as religion. It is long since been held, that people have a right to their religious beliefs. However, religious beliefs have been taken over and miscategorized by a few core groups of religion. We think, religion grows beyond that, we think religion is based on the identifying of an individual into a group larger than themselves, with that group holding beliefs core to that individual's identity. To that extent, we think naturalism is a form of religion. They believe in mother earth as a deity, those people's religious beliefs demand of them particular dietary restrictions. We think, this is just as atrocious as banning kosher food, or halal food, in an entire country, because that's not necessarily the most healthy way to eat. It is these people's right to consume organic food, and without dealing with that, proposition cannot win. Secondly, on comparative benefits. Look, we recognize that organic food isn't necessarily the most healthy, but until you ban mcdonald's, until you ban ice cream, until you ban candy, you have no moral leg to stand on to say: we're banning organic food because of health benefits. Individuals have the right to opt into food that is less healthy, but supports other systems of their identity. For those reasons please oppose.
We should not further exploit sustainable energies. So, the way that the government set ups this debate is that this is really in terms of exclusion to non-sustainable energies. So the question in this debate is whether or not we should exploit sustainable energies to the point where we exclude other forms of energy, which we think is a major problem, and that's where the clash of this debate is going to be. So the first point that the government brings up, we think, is actually the strongest argument for our side which they talk about climate change, that sustainable energies are generally greener, and because climate change is such a huge risk, if sustainable energies can slow climate change or deter it altogether, then this is a massive boon in that the benefits are are endless. But we think that the real problem is that, in the status quo, we are basically at a tipping point which is that if we produce essentially any more carbon emissions than we are right now, then we're going to go past a tipping point where no further action is going to slow the changes or change the the impacts of climate change. And many scientists believe we've already gone beyond that tipping point. So given that this is the case, we think that no matter how we shift towards sustainable energies, it's not going to do nearly enough to change the impacts that are coming our way. We think that this means that we need to be exploiting as much energy, as many resources as we have available to us right now, because we need to begin to prepare for the harms that are about to accrue from global warming. This means massive development projects in interiors of countries away from the coast. This means developing preparation for the incoming refugee crisis. This means developing the way that we do agriculture and provide clean water. And all these are going to require immense a massive use of energy, and we think that excluding the use of of of fossil fuels is going to mean that we don't have the sufficient amount of energy to truly prepare for the changes that are coming. And given that these changes are essentially going to happen, there is nothing we can do at this point really to stop them, we think that we need to be putting everything that we can into protecting future generations. And so, I'm fine with using sustainable energies, but to to use them at the exclusion of fossil fuels is a serious risk to our future survival. The next argument they make is about energy independence and about how domestic access to energies means that economies are more secure and sustainable energies like wind and solar, these are energies that are generally able to be produced anywhere. We think that we can still invest in sustainable energy. Like we have no problem with sustainable energy as a concept, but we don't think that you need to do this at the exclusion of fossil fuels. And if you're doing so in such a way that you're creating short term long term investments in these strategies, the long term is not what is important right now, because the long term looks a certain way no matter what. The damages are coming no matter what. What matters is how we prepare in the short term in order to brace for those damages. The final argument that they make is about technological advancement. And similar to the space race, you can create new offshoots of technology that may improve the world in dramatically other ways, but we think that research and development, to the exclusion of any sort of short term gain, is bad in that climate change is essentially a ticking time bomb. And while long term planning and progress would've been great thirty, forty years ago, right now it's all about what we can do to prevent the most harms coming in the long run and preparing people for those harms. And we think the way you do that is through continual use of fossil fuels. Sure, you can use sustainable energies as well, but using all the resources we have available to us to prepare our infrastructure in our countries as much as possible. For these reasons, we should not further exploit sustainable energies.
So to clarify where we stand in this debate, we're not in favor of the complete annihilation of all forests, but we do believe that enforcing one universal standardized, you know, form of limitations or regulations on how much trees can be cut down brings more harm than good, because it's inefficient and it doesn't bring into consideration additional interests that we think are just as important as , you know, keeping the forests safe. Before we begin, let's address the arguments made by side government. So the first thing they tell us is on how the damage is irreversible, and deforestation leads to many damages to the environment, like extinct species. Well, first of all, we think that as far as the human ability and knowledge and the technology evolves, there certainly might be damages that will become reversible. Even extinction of species might be reversible in the future with the right technology. But like on top of that, even if it's it won't be possible, we're sorry, but it's just unclear to us why this matters so much. Species get extinct all the time because of other species that are stronger than them. Humans didn't make this stuff up, it's a natural thing. It is unclear exactly what species are side government so afraid for, and what's the big harm from them going extinct. Next they talk about how there are also people and communities that depend on on the forests for their livelihood, and they get hurt from deforestation, like loggers and what not. And this is probably true, but pay attention this is no longer irreversible, they could always find a different job elsewhere, and secondly we say that we have to weigh this harm against the other people whose whose job actually depends on cutting down the trees. Once we enforce strict rules of forest management, this will also cost us jobs of people that work in like construction and whatever that depend on this, so we have to weigh between different this conflicting interests and yeah that's it. And lastly, they talk about how future generations have an equal right to enjoy the forests. While we disagree, we don't acknowledge the rights of people that weren't yet born. Rights only exists where there are interests. And where there are no such interests, there are no rights. This is why we allow ourselves to perform abortions, for instance. Besides, we think that it's far more important to take care of like future generations in brazil having enough places to live, like enough residential areas, than taking care of them being able to enjoy more forests. On the constructive, we say the following thing. Sustainable forest management is an evolving process, and and like the way in which it is most efficient to do so is based on the the latest scientific knowledge and our best understanding of the forests' ecosystem, which is very complicated and influenced by numerous external factors. And we say, similarly, that each place has different context, difference like specific ecological and environmental conditions, different social and economic like factors, different political factors, different cultural factors. These all have to be taken into consideration, and we have to look at each place individually and see like when would deforestation is really necessary, and where it where it isn't. Therefore it's just unwise and inefficient to adopt one standardized forest management solution. This brings more harm than good.
In the beginning of the previous speaker's speech, we heard that he intends to talk about how there isn't and shouldn't be a right to bear arms but apparently he forgot, because sadly he never got around to it. If I am to show that this is a basic right, then all of the arguments that came from the previous speech about how this is or isn't necessary, they just don't matter anymore because if it is a basic right, then we mustn't impose stricter controls or limitations on it. Well, here is the explanation. We think that if there ever existed such a thing as a natural right, an inalienable right, then it must be the right to self-defense. If someone tries to attack you, the rule of nature, the law of nature, requires and demands that you would be illegitimate in trying to defend yourself. This has existed far, far like way before the modern state ever came to be. And when someone comes when the person that comes and tries to attack you is much bigger and stronger than you, to the point that you literally have no chance of defeating him with your own bare hands, then you are also perfectly within your rights of self-defense to pick up a brick or a wooden beam or something and use them as weapons. But what if you are so small and and weak and you live among people, some of which much larger and stronger than you, and they can at any given moment try and attack you, and let's say that it is even quite a likely event that some of them will try. When that happens, there is no way for you to make sure that you will find bricks or wooden beams to save you in the moment of truth. What then? Surely, it would be fair to say that just to be on the safe side, you would be legitimate in carrying around these weapons with you. This is a very reasonable extension of your right to self-defense. Let's take one further step. What happens if some of these big bad mean people also manage to put their hands on bricks and sticks and they plan to use them in order to attack you? Alas, the balance is against you yet again. In this particular case, in order to keep yourself , you know, secure, there is no choice but to step it up a notch and acquires some deadlier equipment. This is how we eventually reach from the undeniable fact that everyone has a right to self-defense to the necessary conclusion of a right to bear arms, a right which, as the founding fathers were smart enough to recognize, no government can legitimately take away. Now, let's ask what's likely to happen once we introduce stricter gun control? Daniel tries to say that this way we would have less gun violence because bad people will have less access to firearms. We disagree. We think that with the amount of weapons already purchased and that are already circulating, with no good way of regulating them obviously, plus with black markets that are going to be, it is very, very unlikely that a bad person that wants to put his hands on an assault rifle will not manage in finding one. What is likely, though, is that good law-abiding people will have less weapons because it will be harder to acquire weapons. This is bad twice. Firstly, because you need a good guy with a gun in order to stop a bad guy with a gun, and the more people walking around with guns for self-defense, the the the quicker an incident of shooting or mass shooting can be contained. But secondly, we say that guns deter assailants to begin with. If I plan an attack and I see that a lot of people in the in the area have weapons, then it's far less likely that I will go through with it. I will look for a weak spot, and the more gun control we have, the more weak spots we have. For all of these reasons, please oppose the motion.
We hear two very different types of arguments coming from the previous speaker. Let's answer them one by one. The first argument. In the first argument, they tell us that not guilty is not an option, and a person that uses that successfully uses the insanity plea mustn't go home, because you know we have to protect society from a potentially dangerous individual, and for rehabilitation purposes. Note that eitan confuses two different things here. The first is being found guilty or not guilty, and the second is being released home. These are not the same things. Note, that already in the status quo, in order to institutionalize a mental patient forcefully, we needn't find him guilty of anything, we we hospitalize people even if they hadn't done anything, but we have cause to believe that they might pose a threat or a danger to their surroundings, or to to themselves, we do this all the time, there's no problem with that. So we have no problem of forcing a person that has used the the insanity plea to commit himself to a mental institution for a certain period of time, for all the important reasons that side government talks about. But we will insist that such a person is not guilty and should not be convicted, since there was no mental elements, no mens rea to his crime, and this is something that's a crucial and necessary condition in order to facilitate the criminal offense. So, yes, not guilty is an option. In fact, it's the only option, and this entire argument is not exactly on clash. Then we hear a second argument, and we need to answer this as well. What eitan tells us is that seeing as this is a complicated professional matter, therefore therefore a certified psychiatrist should be the one to decide, and not the members of the jury. So we'd like to remind eitan that the members of the jury don't just decide whatever they want, but they sit and hear what's called expert witnesses that give expert opinions based on their professional expertise, so the advantage in this system is that unlike what side government are offering, this allows the jury to hear several opinions, sometimes conflicting opinions, and reach a decision based on more information than just one expert witness, that even though he's an expert in his field, might make mistakes, just like anybody else, but there will be no second chance of correcting those errors under the system that side government are are proposing. This means that we're not really losing any important information in the jury system, because the expertise of the psychiatrists there's is still playing a vital part, but rather we gain more information, because we allow for the jury to hear several expert witnesses and expert opinions, and and thus they can see a bigger picture and decide based on all of the information. So for all of these reasons, we are very proud to oppose.
Look, so far as side government agrees with us that it's vital that we maintain social security as an option, we say that the only feasible way to do this is to keep it mandatory. Side proposition cannot hold the stick at both its ends. They tell us they don't want to cancel social security, just don't want to force people to take part in it. They have three arguments for this. Let's refute them one by one. Firstly, they talk about the right to take taxes and how social security doesn't stem from that right. They tell us that taxation is like an armed robbery, this robbery has to be justified, and it can only be justified for redistribution purposes because the state knows to identify needs that the individual cannot identify, but the state doesn't know what's best for the individual himself, therefore, social security isn't justified. Now, we don't really see the use in this weird philosophical argument because it doesn't even convince us that taxation is justified. So what if the government identifies someone else's needs. What does it have to do with me? Why does it justify taxing me? We say that the real answer to taxation is a lot simpler than that. We take taxes because this is the only way to get things done. Because without forcing you to pay taxes, the government isn't going to have enough money to fund its army or to fund basic infrastructure or other public goods, and this entire redistribution that they're talking about so much is at best, just an added benefit as far as we're concerned. Now crucially, if we allow every citizen to opt out of paying taxes, there will be very few people that will choose to do so voluntarily and that is what justified justifies a forced taxation. This is the exact same way in which we are going to justify the current social security program and that is by showing that if we agree that it, like, that we want to still have such a thing that's called social security, as side government agrees with us, then the only way to do so is by making it mandatory. So, secondly, they tell us that sometimes it's a smart like it it would be smarter to invest your money now because it's going to pay off later, and then social security is just like a tax that deters people from investment. Now they tell us that the individual has a right to choose what to do because he's the one that suffers the consequences. Now we're going to fully accept that, yes, every type of taxation operates as an inhibitor for investment. What can we do? Like this is just like taxation. Of course it goes out against investment, but that's just something that we're going to have to live with if we want social security to still be functional. Lastly, they tell us social security isn't sustainable, and the only way to solve this is to allow whoever doesn't whoever doesn't need the system to just opt out. Now note: this is the heart of the argument. This is the clash really. They tell you that in order to sustain itself, social security must become optional. We are going to say that the very moment that we make it optional, we are signing the obituary of the social security program. It is true that there are hardships of, like, aging and other problems that create short-term challenges. Now we're talking about twenty to thirty years from now and that, I'm sorry, long-term challenges twenty thirty years from now, and we are going to have to find ways to overcome these challenges. For instance, maybe raising the retirement age is an option. But opening up social security to only whoever is interested in it is going to make sure that, already in the short term, this entire business is going to come crashing down, rendering the long-term threats irrelevant. Why? Simple. We say that people can fall into two groups. There are those that , you know, extract more social security money than the money that they put in, you know, unemployed people, handicapped people and so on. And there are those that invest more social security like money from what they actually are entitled to get. Now, these are essentially the people that fund the other people. Side government could have simply resisted that and and said that this is unfair, but it seems that they are all fine with redistribution, right? So we don't even have to justify it. What happens the moment that opt out is going to become possible is, obviously, that whoever pays more than he is entitled to get is going to opt out, and this and like the only people wanting to stay are the ones that have something to gain from social security. Only now there's going to be no possible way of funding them. We say that this is, of course, unsustainable, and so we see that all of the arguments of side proposition don't stand in the debate. Please oppose.
I stand in firm opposition to the motion: we should raise the corporate tax. What's really important here is that anytime that we raise taxes on corporations, it's ultimately a tax on the consumer cause at the end of the day, if you charge corporations, say, ten percent of their profits each season, they're gonna charge ten percent more of the average person in order to recoup their profits. This will drive down demand and ultimately make the economy worse for everyone. With that in mind, I have two arguments, but first some brief rebuttal. My opponent talks about how this is a massive wealth disparity as a result of a failure to have these kind of taxes. He says that raising the corporate tax will allow for paying for things like welfare and expanding individuals capacity to be effective. A few responses: first, we think that this will ultimately be worse for the poor. If you raise corporate taxes on things like tyson, on chiquita, vegetation, fruits, vegetables, meat, all become far more expensive. This means that food prices for the poor rocket up. The same is true for shell or really any other corporation. When the price of goods increases by a substantial margin, it's awful for the poor. These are the people who starve first. These the people who have no ability to actually fend for themselves because their jobs are not paying them effectively. This brings me to my first point about jobs. We think that when you raise the corporate tax, the response is that demand goes down. This is because the price of goods go up. But when demand goes down, there's also less of a need for a huge supply, the result of it in increased corporate taxes. First, you fire individuals. You can't afford to have as many workers. Second, you increase the price of goods in order to recoup the costs, and you can increase the price of goods because you can no longer meet the demand of the previous amount that you were offering at at the previous price point. That is to say, at one dollar, if you sold a hundred different of your goods, we think that at two dollars you can far less, which means you need to produce less, which means you need less workers. Ultimately, this means that the poor lose their job, they can't afford anything, and wealth disparity increases by a massive amount. The next thing my opponent says is that it's easier to cut the higher up individuals, but this is false false as well. We think that it's true that cutting the wage of the average worker is difficult, because they can go to a different place and just find a job that pays just as well, but when you increase the corporate tax across the board, the result is one in which all workers, all jobs, become less effective and pay less money. This means that individuals have no real opportunity cost of staying at their jobs. If they jump ship, they don't actually get paid any more. As such, you're likely to see a lot of jobs pay less money, while other jobs get cut. Finally, my opponent says that the result of this is that you can have much more public employment, that this will increase the total amount of jobs. This just isn't true and is ultimately bad. We think that a lot of the time this is going to go to the military in building more jets. This means that, sure, some programs at a defense contractor might become more might get more money, might become more active, but doesn't actually give jobs to the poorest individuals. Additionally, we think it's bad to put all of your eggs in one basket, especially the government, because if there's ever a downturn, huge numbers of people will lose their jobs, and the government's not a very effective actor at mitigating that kind of risk. My final argument is about competitiveness. We think if you increase corporate taxes, the global competitiveness of US goods decreases by a massive amount. This further decreases demand, which has the cyclical effect which I discussed earlier, which ultimately trickles down to the poor and makes them lose their job and their savings. For this reason, we should not raise the corporate tax.
In his last argument, the speaker from proposition suggests we should simply always have daylight savings time. Two things about that: one, it's a functional misunderstanding of how daylight saving time works. It's not like by implementing daylight saving time at all hours you always get more daylight. In the summer you get more daylight, in the winter you get less daylight because the daylight are in the early hours of the morning during which people otherwise wouldn't be awake. But crucially, the motion reads end daylight savings time. By supporting a system of only daylight savings time, the speaker is essentially rooting for opposition in this debate. Four more points of rebuttal and then one argument on why having waking hours and sunlight hours coinciding is so crucial. One, he says it's harder to calculate a time zone difference with daylight savings time. The response to this is who you kidding. Nobody's sitting there looking at his watch and then doing minus seven to get the time, you google what the time is somewhere. Google can probably keep up with whether or not they've implemented daylight savings time. Two, he says daylight savings time is arbitrary. Two responses: a, why? We see no evidence to daylight saving time being arbitrary and the speaker offers none such evidence. But two, even if it is, fix the arbitrariness of daylight savings time. That's not a reason to abolish it all together. Three, he says global business is more difficult to do when you're not sure if they're thirteen hours back or twelve hours back. So a, recognize the impact of one additional hour out of ten, twelve, thirteen, whatever it is is quite minimal. It also falls to the issue of being able to easily calculate it. But b, and this leads me to my last point of rebuttal, and this is important. Recognize that at the moment the speaker recognizes the importance of time zones he's essentially recognizing the rationale behind the necessity of daylight savings time. The notion that being awake during waking during sunlight hours that working during sunlight hours that having your day start when the sun comes up and end when the sun goes down is more important than having everyone being able to look at their clock at at at two in the afternoon and say oh everyone's that work today all around the globe at this hour. So why is it so important that we have waking hours and sunlight coinciding? Three reasons: the first reason is that it increases happiness of individuals. Sunlight raises the levels of serotonin in the brain which means that your receptors are more open to joy. This is why you see higher levels of depression in places closer to the arctic circle where they get far fewer hours of sunlight. By making sure that people are awake during more hours of sunlight, we avert depression to some extent and get happier people. Secondly, energy efficiency. This is quite simple. You don't need energy, you don't need lights, you don't need pretty much any form of energy while you're asleep. If that time coincides with the time that it's dark out great. If you're asleep during light hours than a, you need some sort of energy in order to darken it to be able to sleep better and if you're awake during dark hours you need to consume energy in order to light up the area. That's just massive amounts of waste for no particular reason. Lastly, we say it creates crime aversion. How so? The number one factor in whether or not people are willing to commit a crime is the likelihood they believe of being caught for committing that crime. Darkness creates a cover under which people are less likely to commit crimes. Now today you have a situation where in during waking hours it is more difficult to commit crimes because there is light out, people are awake, people are around, and therefore you're more likely to get caught therefore you are less likely to commit that crime in the first place. At the point at which you're waking hours no longer coincides specifically with hours of light, there is more of a likelihood of more people being willing to commit crime because they're awake at opportune moments for committing crimes. For all these reasons please oppose the motion.
Don't ban genetically modified crops. Sam talks about how these things are controlled by corporations as though literally every aspect of our life isn't. Like the problem with this argument is that he had to show why it being controlled by a corporation means there's a justification to ban. Insofar as being controlled by a corporate interest is true of basically every single sellable good within a capitalist system, we can't just ban GMO's on the basis of corporate control since then you'd literally be banning everything. This sounds more like an attack on capitalism than on GMO's specifically. He talks about unreliable science. We also think this is inaccurate. Like maybe there's not enough information for some specific gene modification and those we think can be regulated individually, but the majority of modifications made are known because they've been around for awhile and the studies of impact have been done in order for them to get to market in the first place. Moreover bans prevent research so it's unclear how sam will ever get the testing he wants if he bans it. We're fine with a world in which we require GMO's to go through regulatory agencies. Like we think the government has the ability to mandate that, we just think it's problematic to just give up on something that could be helpful to so many people because you're worried that capitalism perverts it. Two main arguments, first on why it's good for the economy. Genetically modified crops are the result of innovation that creates an entire industry. This involves everybody from researchers to industrial producers and lab staff to the people who drive the delivery trucks. It is a massive amount of jobs that are at all levels of education which we think is something that oftentimes gets we get not enough of in current society at the point that so many jobs are only appearing at like the higher levels or specifically in things like engineering. We also think it provides a new niche for international trade. Like there are highly profitable market spaces that countries like the united states that have the knowledge power can take advantage. We think then it's good for international collaboration, globalization, and the economies of all of the groups that are involved in this insofar as you now have this kind of like stream of genetically modified crops back and forth or like an established trade that like previously just didn't exist before genetically modified crops existed. Our second argument is about societal good. First to address the argument on farmer autonomy, like first we just think that farmers can decide whether or not they want to buy into genetically modified crops for themselves. Like there's plenty of market for organic farming and we just don't think that farmers are forced into buying GMO's, rather they get to decide if the fact that they'll be able to produce more and be more efficient and like sell more at the end of the day is worth the fact that they're compromising being all natural or whatever other trademarks they might have had. Moreover we think that this just never makes things more expensive because often the mass production element of genetically modified food makes it cheaper. Sam talks about dangerous chemicals. I just think this means he doesn't understand how genetically modified crops work. Like the reason we need all of these dangerous chemicals is because current produce current produced necessitates those kind of protections in order to keep pests off of it. The cool thing about genetically modified stuff is that you don't have to use as many dangerous chemicals because you can just build in defenses against pasts and weeds that eliminate the need for pesticides or insecticides or weed killers in the first place that are then potentially harmful to humans. This involves just like transacting a gene that is often found in ladybugs that makes them uncomfortable for like birds of prey to eat and you put that into things like genetically modified crops and suddenly you don't have issues with pests anymore. So we just think that that harm is always going to be more real on government side. Then we want to talk about the potential for better food. Like we think the fact that you can create food that is more nutritionally dense, that you can have a higher yield, have food that is more resilient, and the fact that all of this is made at a cheaper cost just vastly outweighs any potential harms because you can literally do things like solve hunger and poverty in specific areas by providing this at such a low cost and providing it in such a high amounts. Proud to oppose.
Arguing that the fire in grenfell tower proves that tower blocks, as a whole, need to be banned is just about as crazy as arguing that because of the tragedy of the malaysian airplane that we need to, you know, ban commercial flying as a whole. The first thing that we hear from sam is about how the cheap construction and the poor upkeep of these towers turns them into dangerous buildings. But this is an incredibly weird argument because, I mean, that's exactly what safety regulations are meant for. The tragedy in grenfell tower happened because there were several breaches of regulations, and no one bothered to do anything about it. All that is needed is simply to enforce these regulations. I'm sorry, I couldn't understand what was the problem in installing proper fire escapes. In addition, if we take the logic of the previous speaker and assume that regulation cannot help because, you know, these are buildings designated for lower class residents, and there is no incentive to adhere to the high standards of materials and so on, so this proposition, if all of that is true, isn't going to solve anything, because even if instead of tower blocks we would just have normal apartment buildings that are also designated for lower income income families, they will suffer the same deficiencies. So even if they are right in describing the problem, they are just simply not solving it in any way. But then sam continues to say that society is to blame for the poor being poor, and therefore we have an obligation towards them. First, pay attention that this argument is completely off-clash in this debate. The government has an obligation to protect its citizens safety whether they are rich or poor. And indeed, they do so by, you know, enacting safety regulations and enforcing them. And I'm going to show that without tower blocks, the housing market, in so many areas, is going to become that much more expensive and that much harder for poor people to find a rooftop to live under. So, if it is indeed our obligation to take care of these people, side government in this debate are doing the exact opposite. The next thing that they say is that tower blocks create density in city centers, leading to bottlenecks in accessing public resources and public services. Now, this is a stronger claim, but here are the problems with it. A: we haven't heard any good reason as to why we cannot simply increase the amount of public services and resources in those areas so that they, you know, meet the demand. But secondly, we say that the urbanization trend isn't going to disappear after we get rid of high-rise buildings. People flock to city centers because that the like this is where the city, this, sorry, this is where the business centers are. This is where the commercial centers are. There's jobs there. There is culture and art and nightlife. Therefore, demand for living in metropolitan cities is pretty much rigid, and so this problem isn't going to be fixed. The only way to stop this is by offering compelling alternatives in different places, and there is no good reason for us not to build tower blocks outside of of the main cities as well, and develop the infrastructure and the services around it so that we don't have this overload in one particular area. Lastly, we hear about the broken windows theory and how tower blocks endorse more crime. Well, this exists in both worlds. Sam fails at in like he fails to explain to us how, as soon as his proposition passes, all of the poor can suddenly find themselves living in fancy luxurious neighborhoods. This argument is completely off-clash. So unfortunately, we didn't hear any one good reason why inherently there is something bad about tower blocks that cannot be fixed by anything other than blanket policy banning them. So the we say something very simple: the reason that tower blocks are essential is because they are the most efficient efficient way to allow for affordable housing for working class people in city centers. If the government really do does believe that we have an obligation to help these lower income people, then it's impossible for us to demand from them to be living in the suburbs, where there are no jobs and like no access to all of the human capital, social capital, cultural capital, that the city has to offer. Please oppose this motion.
We should not introduce a smoking ban. Despite the obvious harms that come from smoking, we do not think that it is the government's role to dictate what people are allowed to do with their body, that violating someone's bodily autonomy simply for the purpose of imbuing your value system on them is not is not a legitimate way to form is not a legitimate way to govern and creates a sense of tyranny that is ultimately unjust. So, let's go through the arguments that the government side presents. They give you two broad reasons why we should ban smoking. The first is because of the harms of secondhand smoke, that third-party harms by individual third-party harms created by individuals smoking means that we should ban smoking because even if individuals are willing to take on the risk themselves, others aren't consenting to this, and they give the example of children with parents who smoke. So a couple of responses. First, we think it's totally legitimate to ban people from smoking in public spaces, which the vast majority of places already do. The the government speaker talks about like smoking in bars but, personally, I've never been to a bar where you could just smoke inside of the bar. Most people are forced to go outside. And that's the easy response to this, is that people can just smoke outside in areas where the actual impact of secondhand smoke just is negligent. Like if your if you're a parent with a child who smokes or a parent who smokes with a child, you can just go smoke outside. The idea that like we're fine with saying, also, it's child abuse to like smoke in the same room as a child. That's legitimate, but there's easy options for people to get around these harms these secondhand harms that mean that you don't need to ban this. We think that banning something is an extreme act that means that there should be really no other recourse, and there's clear recourse here. They try to say that everyone just smokes in public, like that you don't just smoke in your apartment or anywhere else, but we think, again, this is ludicrous. You can just smoke outside. This is what the vast majority of smokers do in the status quo, and people do smoke in their home. Like this is just not a reason to ban this. It's just an assertion about how people behave. So, the second argument that they make is that it's justified to paternalize individuals for their own sake and says that no rational person chooses to smoke. So, while it's certainly true that smoking is not a rational decision for your long-term health or is not is not a decision that maximizes your long-term health, to say that people should have certain value systems and for the government to place that on them, we think, is unjust. We think ultimately what the government should allow people to do is form their own value systems so long as they don't hurt other people, which is why we're fine banning smoking in public but not outright. And we think that people can choose to take on the benefits of smoking at their own risk. Many people find smoking to be relaxing, a way of calming themselves. Many people find smoking to be something that they want to do socially. Some people just don't value their long-term health to the degree that others do, and we think that that is a legitimate a legitimate choice to make. There's no reason that the number of lives the number of years lived necessarily means quality of life is higher. And we think that people should be able to make those value choices for themselves, especially adults, which is what we're talking about in this round. Then they assert that people start smoking because they're inebriated. This is an argument by example. This doesn't say why people are more likely to be this way. It doesn't give any source for why people do this. This says, " I know some people that have done this so it must be true of all, " and we think that the government to just make legislation legislation that bans an action because of an assertion like this is is ludicrous. The final argument is that people shouldn't be able to smoke because of those long-term harms. This is just an argument whose principled claim that the government should ban x because it creates long-term impacts is an argument that justifies almost any sort of government action, and we just think that this takes the government's power where way beyond a scope that we're comfortable with. For these reasons, we should not introduce a smoking ban.
Part of the idea of going to school is to also learn how to develop social skills, important social skills, in addition to just studying in the classroom. We think that learning how to deal with the opposite sex is a major part of that. The entire prime minister speech is focused specifically on all-girls school and the advantages that it has in terms of strengthening the status of women. We think that the outcome of the sexual segregation is going to be detrimental, especially to women. A few points of rebuttal. So the first thing that we hear is that all-girls schools create more powerful, influential women, and then they move on to analyze why it's important that there will be role models for women. Now obviously, we would agree that role models are important, but we have never truly heard a real analysis that explains why is it that single-sex schools will create more role models than, you know, normal mixed schools. All that we've heard is one example of hillary clinton, and of course that we can give a million examples of role models that didn't attend such schools. So the next thing that we hear is that these schools somehow contribute to the feminist movement and creates political activists but again, we never hear any comparative analysis that will make us think that regular schools cannot contribute in the exact same way. Next we hear about how symbolism is important and even if we would agree to that, it's completely unclear what exactly is the symbol in this debate, what it represents and who is it supposed to like speak to. And the last thing that the previous speaker says is more interesting and that is that in the vicinity of boys, girls feel less confident to, you know, take part in class and that in a all-girl environment, this creates a safer environment that helps women develop their confidence. Now this idea sounds plausible but but here's the problem: the real world is not a safety net. There's no safe spaces in the job market. Girls who leave single-sex schools will have to compete against boys. And we say that by segregation, all that we have done is basically to delay that this, you know, clash, this meeting, until the very moment of truth and there, it's still very likely that these women will just go back to being more quiet and more invert because they've never experienced this type of competition, they haven't gained experience on how to deal with this. On to the on to the constructive: why do we believe that specifically girls that go to single-sex schools are the most harmed? A: because, sadly, it's very hard to ensure that the allocation of resources between all-girls schools and all-boys schools or mixed schools is going to be, you know, equal. We think that it's kind of likely that the men that sit in the higher offices and decide where the money gets to go will be biased in favor of boys, and so they will be the ones that get the best teachers, the best programs, the best facilities, and it's been proven that all of these things are of great importance and and influence on achievements. B: because even the most successful girl in single-sex schools, is going to always have to doubt herself and ask whether she would have been as successful had she studied with boys in the classroom as well. And c and more most importantly: as we said, we think that a huge part of what schools are meant for is to equip you with the social interactions necessary in order to prepare you for life and society. Segregation between boys and girls is going to necessarily cause the fact that all of these connections, all of the special connections between boys and girls that usually take place in a certain age, you know, when you start to develop awareness for your sexuality, you have your high school sweethearts and everything, so these will all have to be , you know, repressed and suppressed. And we think that it's dangerous specifically for girls, because this might lead boys to become much more aggressive towards girls when they do meet them outside schools because all they know is the interactions between boys and boys that, you know, are often characterize with, let's say, less tenderness and sensitivity. So bottom line: we believe that we're going to see more sexual violence towards girls. For all of the reasons that we've mentioned, please oppose this motion.
From what it looks like to me it appears that side government has missed the fact that this debate is comparative. You cannot win here by simply pointing out bad things that come from patriotism, without comparing them to the good things that come with it, because the entire purpose here is to understand what is there more of, but if like we're not getting even an attempt of creating a metric for comparison from the previous speaker. On top of that, it seems like the previous speaker confuses patriotism with nationalism. The points that were brought up are, you know, the concept of ingroup supremacy and the silencing of criticism, these are examples of full-on nationalism, which is patriotism in its most extreme form. But we don't think and we didn't hear any argument that explains why patriotism must always necessarily lead to nationalism. Patriotism simply means, and these are not my own words but , you know, dictionary definition, love and loyalty to one's country. We think that there are a lot of examples for countries that are very peaceful, very tolerant to the other, very open to ideas of free trade and immigration, and without a great big army, that are also definitely defined with a very high level of patriotism. Take for instance, canada or switzerland or denmark or australia, we think that these are examples are already sufficient enough to bring down the entire case made by side government. So what's left for us to do now is to bring our comparative analysis of why patriotism leads to more good than bad. So we think there's something very natural about patriotism, meaning loving and prioritizing your own country. We think that it's just like people tend to naturally love and prioritize their own family and its needs above the needs of other families. By doing so, this doesn't mean that I hate whoever isn't from my family, or that I think that my family is superior to other families, or that my child matters more than others on an objective level. This simply means that he matters more to me. I, as a parent, am not being objective when it comes to my children. This is not just natural, this is a mechanism that is very much required in order to maintain society. Had I like had I not felt that I owe my my kid more than I owe any other kid, or that I owe my wife more than any other random person in the street, it is unclear how would a like how forming a functioning society would have been made possible. In the same way, we argue that a global order without patriotism, in which no citizen feels especially obligated in any way to his own country, is a world that is very hard to imagine how it's how he's supposed to run. Would it still matter that I am a citizen of one country and not another? Does this mean that we would have to completely open up our borders for uncontrolled immigration without any limitations? The repercussions and implications are so huge that they're barely even foreseeable. Patriotism is also what allows a huge group of tens of millions of people that will never actually meet each other to unite around a common theme, to unite around the flag, around the language, around an anthem. If people would attribute no importance to all of those things, it seems likely that every man would have just looked looked out for his own personal matters and his family's personal matters. It is unclear to us why people would be willing to pay taxes, for instance, to help out their fellow americans if like without patriotism. Patriotism is the glue that holds together all of the pieces in the social puzzle and without it, we will go back to just being separate atoms. Note that in comparison to the harms that you hear from side government that are not necessary or inherent to patriotism, but only represent what patriotism might lead to in its most extremist form, the harms that we talk about are inherent to a world without patriotism and therefore, patriotism leads to more good than harm.
We should not end water fluoridation. So, before we get into the government side's arguments in this debate, we just want to make two overarching arguments that we think are important to recognize when it comes to this general public debate about water fluoridation. So, the first thing that we want to make clear is that fluoride is at least somewhat good for you. We won't argue that fluoride and water fluoridation has been studied to such a degree that we know with absolute certainty what the exact benefits are, but we do know that through long-term exposure to fluoride and long history of water fluoridation that it has generally positive health benefits and that fluoride in other uses is also generally good for the human body. And so we think that at the at the very most, even if there are some side effects that could be shown through larger research, we think fluoride is definitely not a net bad. But what's more important about what about this debate than fluoride is really about whether or not the government should be making decisions based on misinformation. Because the only people in public records, the only people in the public discourse that actually care about this issue are not people that are concerned about saving a little bit of money and think that this is a waste of money or anything like that, because this isn't a particularly huge government cost, the only people that care about this are those that have this misinformed belief that fluoride is actively bad for you, that consuming fluoride is somehow going to turn to you getting all these number of diseases, or genetic disorders, or anything like that, and it's similar to the anti-vax movement that we've seen spring up in public discourse in the last couple of decades. And we think that, principally, misinformation shouldn't dictate government action, especially because we think that people are only capable of making decisions if they are properly informed. We prevent people from making poor decisions, the government prevents people from taking certain actions all the time because of an asymmetry of information. And we think that this is one of those times where instead of the government preventing people from taking government action taking private action, the government is just not allowing people to dictate their own actions, the government's own actions because of misinformation, which we think is principally the same and is a principle that we will stand by. So that being said, let's respond to the government arguments in this round. So, first, they say that people can get fluoride from many other ways. We just don't think that this is a positive reason against water fluoridation, but let's get into the meat of their arguments. The first is that we should be risk-averse. They say that fluoride fluoride fluoridation in the water is underresearched and potentially dangerous. So, first, as we said earlier, fluoride itself has been well has been well-researched, and we think that it's not it's given that the long-term period that water fluoridation has been effect, we think that it's very unlikely that large-scale problems are going to pop up that make this major problem. But more importantly, we do think that there is an opt-out for fluoride. You can still do something like drink bottled water. There are many private taps that you can drink from. You think you can and this opt-out is, again, only based on this asymmetry of information. So given that all of those things are the case, we just don't think that risk aversion is something that we need to be concerned with in this debate. The final thing that the government side says is cost and that the government spends money that, you know, creates a tradeoff with other things. But they just assert that this cost is high. It's not really a significant cost to add a little bit of fluoride into a collective water supply, and we think there's no real meaningful tradeoff. This is a classic instance in which people are misinformed and they're trying to change government policy, and we think that, on principle, the government should not react to that misinformation. For these reasons, we should not end water fluoridation.
Side government assumes that which requires proof. The previous speaker literally justifies his criterion for who has a right to life by first asking to see who that criterion applies to, and then conveniently selects the criterion that doesn't preclude groups that he himself has decided that ought to be, you know, defensible and, you know, conveniently selects the criterion that fits with the side that he has to defend in this debate. We're very sorry but that's not how you build a moral argument. That is the definition of circular logic. We haven't heard one objective, true justification as to why is it that human beings or, more precisely, the biological species of homo sapiens is what merits protection of rights. Why, for instance, do animals fall outside of this criterion? No reason. So, on top of that, if the government really wishes to argue that a fetus has an equal right to life just like a living human being, then this basically says that an abortion is nothing short of murder. If that's what they're arguing, why are they okay with abortions that had resulted from acts of rape? If they really want to run a brave case, they have to be brave from beginning to end. So in short, the entire government's logic suffers from a lack of coherency and a lack of clarity. Here's what we bring to you in this debate: the doctrine of double effect, and it's really quite simple. We see that even if we accept that the fetus has a right to life because of his potentiality for life or because of his inability to advocate for himself or for any other reason, the cost that this right to life like charges from the woman is just too great and too grave for us to demand that she doesn't violate that right. Let's conjure up the next thought experiment. If either one of us, let's say the previous speaker, would have woken up to find out that he's been attached to an innocent human beings human being in such a way that that human being's life is dependent on him staying attached by a cable or something to him and that cable not being disengaged, you would have to carry that person around with you everywhere you go, make sure he's fed, you'd have to quit smoking, quit drinking alcohol. You'd have to stop going to work at some stage, to suffer pain and sicknesses and then, after nine whole months of this, you would have to go through an excruciating process that is that leaves your body forever disfigured and different. We say that if all of this would have happened to you, you would have been forced to say that even though the person attached to you has the full extent of the right to life, it wouldn't be it wouldn't have been a crime for you to disengage that cable. It wouldn't have been a crime because the cost on your liberty is just too big. For all of these reasons, we call you to support women's choice and to oppose to this motion.
When eitan talks about the advantages and disadvantages of fluoridization being clear cut he is mistaken. They are not. We are talking about a subject that is deeply debated among experts from the scientific community. It is very far from being settled. So much so that many health organizations including the european commission itself continue to firmly state that they are opposed to this notion that that is a positive thing. Even if there are empirical findings that supports the advantages of fluoridization they should be taken with a grain of salt. Why? A, because there also exist many opposite researches with findings that contradict these conclusions. B, because often these researches are being funded by bodies with an a financial agenda in a policy of fluoridization, therefore their objectivity is compromised. C, because the data that they are based on isn't comprehensive enough. That's simply because this policy doesn't exist long enough in order for us to be able to truly gauge the long term effects of this policy. And d, as a result, even if it's true that fluoride helps deal with cavity, eventually we're talking about a chemical that there is no real way of knowing what other negative effects it might have and if we won't know what we're looking for then obviously this won't come up in the research. Take for example, the decades that it took us until we were able to realize the horrible effects of smoking or cell phone radiation to people's health. And despite the fact that there were many many studies that showed otherwise. So eitan's entire comparative analysis is based on partial data that whose credibility bears a question mark. Therefore it is irrelevant for this debate. What is relevant to the debate is then is the following question, given that the long term medical implications of a certain step are not a hundred percent certain, is it legitimate to force the entire population to become guinea pigs in a huge experiment of the state or rather it is better to allow each citizen to choose for himself what he believes in. We strongly believe that the latter is the more legitimate way. When it comes to my health or to the integrity of my body I have complete autonomy to act according to my own judgment. Take for instance the fact that we do not ban people from smoking cigarettes even though it is clear to us today that this is extremely unhealthy. Consider the fact that we cannot force people to commit themselves to hospitals and undergo treatments that they're not interested in undergoing even if we're really convinced that this is an efficient treatment. Same goes with vaccinations. We do not force people to take vaccines even if we're really certain that they are good ones and in places where it is being forced then we think that it's illegitimate. So if the principle of allowing choice is right in these instances, where there is a relatively big consensus as to the benefits or medical harms of something, then clearly the same principle should be applied in cases where we are even less certain like with fluoride. Regarding the point that like ways between financial heart benefits and and damages we think that it's irrelevant to the debate as well just because we can say that it's like the choice of people to smoke burdens the society financially and we still allow people this freedom because we care more about the independence of our citizens than we do about the few extra bucks. Please oppose.
Don't limit the right to self-defense. Look, I think the point is that we are not talking about groups like police or anyone like that. These are people who should have limitations in self-defense because there's a reasonable expectation for them to be trained enough that they're better at evaluating risk in being in these situations. We think that the average person should have a more expanded right to self-defense exactly because these are people who aren't trained to recognize when the risk is low versus high but, moreover, because for this type of person, those couple seconds of waiting can literally mean the difference between life and death or being significantly more abused than you would have been in the situation otherwise. And at the point that this is true, we're always going to value that innocent individual's rights more than the person who is doing the propagation of the crime. Danny talks for a little bit about how the justice system allows us to have proportional punishments for the level of crimes but he forgets that, at the end of the day, if it is a matter of one person being hurt and the other person being the one who does the hurting, even if it means that that individual who's perpetrating the harm might get disproportionately harmed in retaliation, we think it is worth the fact that it then prevents more harm coming to the one who is innocent. We would rather have preemptive action that protects an innocent party more than having maybe more proportional and fair ex post facto action once the person has already been harmed. Two main arguments, first on letting individuals protect themselves and maximizing safety. Danny talks about how the average person is bad at evaluating their situation, and we don't think that people should have to be better at evaluating real life danger, because all of the situation in which those evaluations have to occur tend to be very high risk, and inaction could mean the difference between life and death. So we think that saying, " hey, it is reasonable for us to expect the average person to pause for a moment to consider their option, " just isn't reasonable for someone who has never had police training versus someone who has. Danny says that the enforcement will be racist and maybe this is true, but we think that it is true in the status quo that people are likely to get away on self-defense claims in situations where the perpetrator is black way more often than when they're white, but we want to note that these kind of policies also work in the other direction, right? Like we think that people of color have a lot easier time defending themselves and like arguing in court when self-defense laws are more loose, because it is harder for that like biased judge or jury to argue with the fact that this was technically something they were allowed to do compared to when, say, when self-defense laws are much more strict, where you can just say: hey, the laws are really strict right now, like we're opening it up to interpretation, and we've interpreted you as being in the wrong. We think that we eliminate that gray area. At the point that this allows people of color to use self-defense as well, we think it's valuable to have around. Danny says you might injure yourself or others. Look, I just think that he continually asserts that people can't defend themselves, but this isn't true, right? Like, sure, maybe not everybody knows how to use a gun, but people who don't know how to use a gun won't have that kind of weapon on them, right? Like, presumably, if I am assaulted, I might have like some pepper spray on me or a knife, but whatever it is that I have, it'll be something I am trained in using, because I'm comfortable enough to have it on me in the first place. So, we can teach people to try every other alternative, but there shouldn't be a moment where people are punished later for defending themselves early on, which is the system that occurs under government government's side. Our second argument is about deterring criminal action. If criminals know the person is likely to fight back, they're less likely to commit the crimes in the first place. Criminals often take advantage of people they think will be easier to take advantage of. And if those people are taught to be self defensive or they have some kind of pepper spray or knife on them, that means there'll be more raised awareness about this in general, and criminals will strike class often. This is especially important because people often choose whether or not to carry things like pepper spray on them depending on current self-defense laws, because they don't want to get in trouble for using it, so they'll leave it at home if the area's strict. Danny basically says then that people shouldn't fight back because they they aren't in court, but I told you why this was problematic at the top of my speech, just cross apply the response now. Proud to oppose.
Don't ban cosmetic surgery. Tim is worried about perpetuating bad norms. First, in order to win on this, tim has to show why cosmetic surgery perpetuates these norms anymore than celebrities and popular media that serve as the inspiration for cosmetic surgery in the first place given that he's not banning those. But moreover we think he's got the directionality of blame entirely wrong. It's not cosmetic surgery that causes and perpetuates these bad norms, these norms are created by other factors in society and people respond with cosmetic surgery to try and fit into those norms. What this means is that banning cosmetic surgery won't actually alleviate the issues that tim wants to deal with because they're going to continue to exist insofar as they are caused by underlying other causes, which means we don't think you should be banning cosmetic surgery. Two main arguments, first on why it's not justified to be banned. Cosmetic surgery doesn't hurt the person doing it that badly and doesn't have any overflow harms. We live in a country that values protecting individual freedom, even when they think that the decisions they might make are bad for themselves or for society. Something perpetuating a bad norm is not reason enough to ban it and tim doesn't do nearly enough work to show you why it should be and why it should outweigh those personal freedoms. This is because we recognize that the government can't just put themselves into other people's shoes effectively. There are just too many people in the world and too many different ways of prioritizing the pleasures in life. We have to let individuals do the weighing for themselves. Things that someone else might see as not worth it can be worth it for the person next to them because they are two different people with different value systems. If the government bans cosmetic surgery, that's massive government overstep. It's the government taking it upon themselves to mold social norms as they see desirable and unfairly interfering in people's lives. If it's that person's body, the government shouldn't be interfering with that. It's not as if cosmetic surgery is being forced on anyone else, they probably can also make the money calculus themselves. Like you're not being coerced into that decision so we just like don't really understand where tim even comes up with the idea that you could possibly justify banning this. Our second argument is about allowing people to be happy. People feel dissatisfied with themselves independent of cosmetic surgery. So all of the issues that tim doesn't like about fat shaming etcetera are going to exist even in a world without cosmetic surgery because these are all things that are caused by societal norms that are propagated by unclear often patriarchal forces. So insofar as he's not getting rid of that, all he's doing is getting rid of one of the methods by which individuals can make themselves feel better while living in that kind of system. Cosmetic surgery can be really beneficial in helping someone feel better about themselves or fixing something that they dislike. And even if it's the case that they should love themselves it's not the case that people always do, and we think that those peoples' desires are valid. By the time you're an adult and are making decisions about cosmetic surgery it's unlikely you're magically going to turn around and love those features, so you might as well be allowed to do what you want with them. Cosmetic surgery will never be something that the majority of people do. It's too expensive, body positivity movements are getting really strong, and plenty of people just don't want to go under the knife. And this cuts out a lot of tim's offense because he depends on trying to show you that cosmetic surgery is so normalized that everyone is feeling dissatisfied with themselves and it's becoming this broad sweeping occurrence that everyone partakes in. Given that this is simply not the reality, we don't understand why you should stop it. Moreover we think he underestimates the power that body positively movements have independently. If we can show you that the government cannot interfere and we can still get a lack of those bad norms, then we automatically win this round because that's what tim has been banking so much on. So recognize that insofar as we have these educational movements that are saying look young women love yourselves no matter what and a lot of people are responding to them, we just don't think that you are ever going to you're you're going to have the same kind of high rates and we think they're going to drop off naturally without the government overstepping. Proud to oppose.
Don't legalize sex selection. Tim says that we can't change the mentality of society and we think this is a very problematic way of thinking because this would be justification for maintaining systems like slavery or the subjugation of women in other ways, where we say look this is so entrenched in the way that we think, so entrenched in our like social fabric that there is no point in fighting against it. And the problem there is that it doesn't actually protect the individuals whose rights are being violated, it just says well given how long it's been that your rights have been being violated I guess we'll continue doing them. Half we have to recognize that even if a toxic system is hard to change, it is very important to continue to try and even more important to not affirm it by doing things like legalizing the bad actions that are part of those systems, such as sex selection. The kind of language that tim uses is completely defeatist. It assumes that we will just never be able to do these positive social things in a world where we've been really successful at changing a lot of social norms. So I just think it is both both a disservice to humanity in terms of the things that we can accomplish and unjust to the victims of these kinds of systems. As it stands, sex selection in the status quo is used to discriminate against women based on sexist traditions and conceptions in society that place men as more valuable than women to a family. When you allow sex selection, you allow people to legally exert their personal bias on their own children. Three arguments, first on embedding sexism in society. When the government legalizes something like this, they send a message to society that the ideas that lead them toward sex selection are valid. It allows the tradition of using sex selection to continue. Look minor sadness about having daughters is fine. We think that tim is wrong, it's not the case that these children are unwanted into the long term. You realize you have a daughter, maybe you're a little bit disappointed, but these things fade over time and it is still your blood and still someone that you care for after a while. But also we just think the value of stopping sexism in the long term matters much more than some resentment in the short term. Sexism is generally trending downward in society, and when you legalize something like this, you stop that trend. You boost back the sexism upwards. We think this is more important than any claim to bodily autonomy because embedding sexism prevents women from accessing bodily autonomy in the long term by normalizing their inferiority in saying that your rights are not nearly as important as mens'. Our second argument is about creating an unsafe society for women in the long term. Even if there are things like resentment now, this makes it so that people will feel that disgust for women forever by reinforcing male dominated society over and over. First it also raises things like sexual assault levels. When you have massive numbers of men as compared to women, you're going to have significantly more sexual assault because you have more male toxicity and male dominated spheres, but also because there are simply not enough women for men to find suitable partners in the long term which raises violence against women just statistically. It also prevents women from being able to move up in the workplace or in education and thus stunts their development because they'll be constantly competing with these men who make all these decisions as well. And we think this is actually just matters a lot more than any future standing of these kids in society that tim is so worried about because even if they are unwanted or treated poorly at least there are not one of the few children in a world that is mostly the other gender that will occur on his side of the house. We weigh society and future society as more important here because of how hostile it will be towards women if we don't make some sacrifices and face some challenges now. Our third argument is that it is generally bad for society. Like women are good at things, right? Like a lot of the time you can have really intelligent women who contribute to spheres whether they're like intellectual or social and we also just think it's really bad to create these societal disbalances because it makes cesspools of hyper-masculinity where men hurt both each other and themselves through this kind of like toxicity and toxic behavior that propagates. Like at the end of the day, women are both a balancing force in society and personally just good for society. Proud to oppose.
We should not end agricultural subsidies. Contrary to what my opponent said, agricultural subsidies are actually good for the subsidizing country, and we're going to explain how and why we're going to win the debate as a result. Our first argument is about why this is necessary for state security. In order for your country to be secure during a war, you have to produce a substantial portion of your own food. The real reason that germany surrendered in world war one isn't that there were too many american soldiers joining the allied army for the germans to keep fighting. It's that the british blockade of germany meant that people were starving in german cities, and the government wasn't able to keep putting down the food riots that were breaking out. Sam tells you that subsidies are really bad because people in other countries benefit, but don't forget that people in your own country benefit as well. Subsidies ensure that your country will keep growing food, even if it's not profitable. Sam acts as though it's just the same to import food from other countries as to grow it yourself, but at the end of the day, in a conflict, only countries that produce their own food will be able to avoid being starved out by a blockade. So we think that although this might seem like a remote threat, for many countries around the world this is actually serious. If you are a small country with a powerful neighbor, it's really important that you grow enough of your own food to provide for yourself so that your neighbor can't cut you off and prevent you from being able to feed your people. Moreover, it also affects your balance of trade. If you're having to spend your money to import food from other countries, that means it's harder to import other goods. There's a limit to how much your country can afford to import, and it's probably better to import things like german and american technology than it is to import rutabagas that you could grow for yourself. So this just doesn't seem to hold water. I think sam's wrong about what this does to your trade and that he underestimates the importance of this to national security, and that this is enough for us to win the debate because of the astronomical harms that can have for your country. Our second argument is that this keeps food costs low. This argument's pretty simple. Low income people in your country directly benefit from food subsidies, because the cost of eating is lower. Many people would have to go without if bread and corn and things like that weren't subsidized, and we think that that's an unacceptable tradeoff, that it's very important that people are able to afford a good diet, and that subsidies make that more likely. In response to something sam said about foreign consumption, we think it's fine if american tax dollars indirectly help starving people around the world have more to eat. Sure, that might not be what people intend when we give subsidies, but if this means that foreign countries that are going through a food shortage can afford to import more american corn and wheat, we think that's a good thing if it saves people's lives. I think he just assumes that it's bad to subsidize other people, but we think you have a moral obligation to help those in need, and driving down the cost of food helps to solve this. A brief point of rebuttal: sam talks about food waste and acts as though food overproduction is a reason to end subsidies. But recognize that food is not all interchangeable. The fact that a lot of grain goes to waste doesn't mean that we shouldn't subsidize dairy production, for instance, where the waste isn't as bad. And, moreover, even though it's true that we overproduce food, millions of people are still starving around the world and thousands within the united states. So I think it's clear that the problem is one of distribution, and it seems unlikely to me that driving up the cost of food would encourage distributors to get more food to people in need. He also mentions lobbying, and I'd just briefly like to say it's unclear to me why this lobbying is bad, other than it perpetuates more food subsidies, which we don't think are bad. So I think sam has to a lot more work to win on that argument. For all these reasons, we should not end agricultural subsidies. Thank you.
Don't disband NASA. Three main arguments, first on why it is a necessary counterbalance to private corporations. Sure the market can now create rockets the way that sam says previously maybe it couldn't, but those markets are always for commercial flights and weapons which is uniquely different than what NASA often does which is a lot more basic research in citizen-centered science about maybe a like long term span in space or like looking for an alternative to our own nation but like in space or just like basic research on like the environments on other planets and things like that. And that kind of research you never ever have incentivized in the private sector because the private sector is motivated by how much money they can make off of investors and how much money they can make off of once they actually produce a good that they sell. So they're always going to be focused on like tours to mars or like spend a night on the moon or a similar kind of commercial planning much more than they're going to be interested in things like what kind of earth like what kind of consistency or chemicals you can find on europa or similar kind of things. And so we think that it's bad than that if you eliminate NASA and the only thing left to look into space are the groups that are looking for monetize it. Basic research and scoping up potential alternatives for life on other planets is really important research that just doesn't get done on sam's side of the house. Moreover though we think that sam seems really worried about private companies getting private investments, but we think that's going to happen either way because they're investing in a fundamentally different type of research. So we just don't think that this is even an argument that functions at the point that private investors are still going to see an opportunity to make a dollar of groups like space x and aren't even going to think about groups like NASA because they're just not profit driven. Our second argument is about spillover technology. I want to address an argument that sam says when he tells us that NASA is less effective than corporations. Recognize this is a hypocritical argument. Sam says that private companies won't get money through private investment but then he says that these corporations have more money than NASA and that's what makes them more effective. So he has to decide, these can't both be true. But it doesn't matter anyway insofar as they fill two different niches as I already told you. But also recognize that NASA still comes up with useful technology. Like the ball point pen was literally a NASA discovery that allowed astronauts to use pens in space but also became incredibly useful for using pens here on earth. So on the way to space exploration you necessarily find a lot of other useful stuff which then becomes developed by the private sector further but still gets discovered as you do basic research. So we think that that's actually very important. Our third argument is about global cooperation. Things like the international space station are some of the only still standing situations of global interaction with the united states even when everything else is falling apart. For example, even at the worst moments of like russia trump aggression or russia obama aggression, we still had russia working with the united states on the international space station because we somehow managed to maintain this like tenuous like kind string of communication at all times. And we think it's good to have these kind of connections with other countries especially in times of tension because it shows that there's potential for cooperation. Sam says it is undemocratic to keep funding NASA. Look like we just think that plenty of stuff that the government funds the average person doesn't think they should right? Like we fund national forests and if you ask the average person they'll probably tell you they don't think that the national forests need funded but we still do this because we recognize that sometimes democracy is wrong. And since the private sector doesn't always solve we think the government then has to. So NASA is actually very similar where it's something that is likely to be an undervalued by the p-private sector and by like the public but it's still something that the government should probably fund insofar as it is important anyway. Proud to oppose.
Don't introduce goal-line tech. Sam spends a long time talking about how he gets more accurate results that makes the game more fair. We agree but we don't think that he told you why fairness inherently matters, either other than when he later talks about how people shouldn't get angry as much. But we think at the end of the day, a lack of fairness is part of what actually attracts individuals to the game in the first place, and other and we think that part of like what that attraction is is the element of humanity and potential for human error. He actually decreases interest because people now feel like things are boring, and people love to rage about how things are unfair, so without that kind of ability, they're less likely to want to be involved with the sport. Sam is worried that it takes up too much time to evaluate like goal goals right now, because the refs have to actively turn everything off and like look at a screen for a while, but we just don't think that this is something that people mind very much. If anything, it's a good time for snacks and conversations with the people that you're watching the game with, but also we just think that this gets outweighed by a lot of the arguments that we make later, specifically because this just doesn't make such a big impact. Two main arguments, first on the spirit of the game. Sam pretends that the resultant anger about bad calls or the perception of bad calls is a bad thing, and we just don't think that that is true. It is a massive part of the sport to have some amount of uncertainty around goals. Fans like to be able to get riled up and hold their breath, and they also like being able to get angry whether a call was wrong or not. It's the activity of being able to get loud and angry over a call and find camaraderie within that loudness and anger that matters a lot more than the truth of it. All goal-line tech does is remove the aspect of uncertainty and prevent fans from being able to enjoy an integral aspect of the sport. We're always going to value the enjoyment of fans more than the truth of whether the goal was made or not, because the fans are the ones for whom sports are created for in the first place. Without fan enjoyment, there wouldn't be any football for us to have this argument about, so we should always maximize that enjoyment to maintain the sport's existence. Our second argument is about how it's an unnecessary expense. Goal-line tech is expensive and even if large athletic events can afford it, the majority of smaller teams can't. We think that football should be accessible to people and leagues who don't have money, and what goal-line tech does is it puts a block between professional leagues and smaller goals smaller groups and younger, less rich kids that give groups with money an advantage. It's those groups that will get to practice with the same technology that they play games with and those groups that will feel like they belong in the stadium that mimics their practices more closely. This might seem like a small detail, but the cultural significance is is a lot. Goal-line technology has the potential to make certain teams feel unprepared and less than, even if they aren't in reality. It also makes referees irrelevant, which we think is a bad thing. We think that referees are a valuable part of the game. They add another human element for fans to connect to and rage against and maybe have certain fandoms about. And at the end of the day, we think that given that the game has lasted for so long and there's some traditional aspect to playing it the way that it is, injecting unnecessary technology doesn't actually serve a purpose. Proud to oppose.
Our opponents in this debate aren't bothered by the fact that the government can lock you up for years just for using pot or that it wiretaps phones and emails. What they deem as a quote gross overstep of government and call fascism or authoritarianism is that the government doesn't allow you to go a hundred and fifty miles per hour like a maniac on a highway. This is a really strange nonsensical case. Note that a lot of their harms that they complain about result from the speed limit not like being too restrictive if this is the case, by all means let's raise it a bit. Their burden is to show us why we need to abolish it completely. They try to tell you that the lifting of the speed limit will be hard politically, but if that is the situation, it means that most people are happy and satisfied with the speed limit in the status quo. Therefore, it is not paternalism, and this contradicts their entire case. Let's hear what sam has to say and answer it directly. First, he says that speed limits are inefficient, first because I need to go slower and that's a waste of time for everyone, to which, again, we say simply lift the speed limit if if it seems too restrictive. Secondly, because it forces everyone to drive close to one another and raises the probability of accidents. So, here again, like raising the speed limit might solve the problem, but we would also note that even if it's true and even if it causes more accidents, which we are not certain about but even if, at least these are small accidents that happen at relatively controlled speeds, whereas if we lift completely the speed limit, maybe maybe car accidents will become rarer but they will also be much more deadly. Lastly, on inefficiency, they tell us that this leads somehow to traffic jams. Here I just didn't understand from sam's analysis what traffic jams have to do with the speed limit. Traffic jams occur because there's some sort of bottleneck, a busy interchange, a long red light, a car accident that blocked the road. Lifting the speed limit will not help avoid all of these so all of the harms that sam tries to derive from traffic jams, like pollutions and pollution and so on, are just simply not not relevant in this debate. Then they talk about the right to transportation being absolute. Why? No idea. Look, is this right for to transportation important? Of course it is. Can the government simply prevent people without any reason from using this right entirely and not let them move around? Of course not. But is it an absolute right, meaning that we cannot put any restrictions on it? Of course it isn't, and we haven't even heard any justification to this. This is just not a serious argument. I'm going to give you one very simple reason to why, no matter what the height of the speed limit is, there must be one, and that reason is legal responsibility. Let's say that I'm a very responsible driver and I always drive within the reasonable limits of what my car can withstand. And let's say that my friend robert isn't as responsible as I am and he drives in a speed that is way too high for the conditions of the road or for the condition of his car, and he bumps into me. The thing is robert didn't break any law if there are no speed limits. So, who do I sue for the damages that were like that occurred to me and to my car? Who's responsible, no one? That's super problematic and for this reason alone, you should oppose the motion.
I stand in firm opposition to the motion, we should subsidize embryonic stem cell research. Embryonic stem cell research is a pipe dream. It's the same sort of thing as artificial intelligence replacing all jobs and creating utopia. It's the same sort of thing as saying that virtual reality will pull us into worlds where we have total control and feel no pain. It is a result of science fiction telling us that these results will always be incredible and they'll help us fix literally everything. The problem in this debate is that my opponent falls into these tropes. He refuses to acknowledge the reality where stem cell research is simply ineffective in ensuring that individuals get cures quickly and effectively. This leads me to my two main points, but first some brief rebuttal. My opponent talks about how this will improve the ability to cure people's diseases. This is simply untrue for a few reasons. First, we think that stem cell research is largely misunderstood. Sure, if we subsidize stem cell research and and actually pay more to understand it, we might learn a few things about curing things. The problem is is that for many people, they don't have access to this kind of technology. And even if they did decrease the price, even if they made it far more accessible, we think it doesn't actually solve a lot of things: STDs, viruses, bacteria. It may solve one or two people's ability to have some nerves in their hand. If you got a a really vicious burn, maybe you'll be able to feel in your finger again, but this is largely unlikely. And even if it were true, we think it's not worth the millions of dollars that would go into it. As a result, we think that the ability to cure disease with stem cells is largely unlikely. It would almost certainly be used only for niche cures, for niche issues, and be incredibly impractical to apply. This leads me to my second argument, the idea of costs. This is where my opponent really loses the debate, because we think the really problematic thing is that the costs that result as come from stem cell research are incredibly prohibitive. It requires people being able to take a lot of time off work and being able to sit still for large periods of time. It requires surgery done by incredibly talented technicians. Even if we put research into it, this would still be true. This will always cost a prohibitive amount of money. Compare this to drugs, compare this to simple medical procedures, and the result is clear. This will be a prohibitively expensive form of healing and as such, it will only belong to the wealthiest individuals. This leads me to my first argument, the idea of market distortion. What my opponent really doesn't get in this debate is that there's a massive incentive to cure disease in the status quo. I'm the first one to cure cancer. I'm the first one to cure an STD. I'm going to make so much money by patenting that cure and selling it to the world. But people don't pursue stem cell research actively, because they understand that stem cells don't actually promise very much. The sort of market distortion is incredibly clear. We think that the markets are just decided that stem cell research simply isn't worth it. They're putting more money into it, sure. People might put more time into stem cell research simply because it's a cheap option which has very little downside because guess what? The government's paying for it all, but we think the total improvement to society isn't actually any better. That is to say, people are less likely to find a cure, simply jump into it as a result of the fact that it's low risk, which is only better for their bottom lines and not better for society. This leads me to my second argument, the idea of focus discretion distortion. We think that the really problematic thing here is that individuals will waste a lot of time on going towards stem cell research, because this sort of time is fungible. The same people who do stem cell research also do other pharmaceutical trials, also try a variety of other cures which we think are essential to improving people's quality of life. The total access to medication will decrease and the total health care industry as a whole will become more expensive and less effective for a huge portion of the population. For this reason, we should not subsidize embryonic stem cell research.
Yaar starts off by telling us that there's some sort of magical reason that only americans get to vote in american elections, and that for some reason it's not being influenced by the election. He says this because he says everybody in the world is influenced by american elections, but surely he recognizes that the level and intensity of influence is drastically different as is the buy-in to the system and for example, things like paying taxes into the system, taking part in the system's educational system, taking part of the system's economic system, etcetera. He never goes on to analyze that any farther, so we're not quite sure how to respond to that other than saying we think it's well within their rights to vote for either party because they could have signed up for either party, even, note, if they are democratic they can sign up as part of the republican party today and effect it from the inside, the only question is can they do both, and we're not sure why that would be a problem. Two points. One, yaar says, " look, the main issue here is that the people themselves are more divided ", not that the politicians are dividing them. Two responses. One, we think it's cyclical. Sure, the people themselves are more divided, this is undoubtedly true, but we think that is likely caused, at least to an extent, by politicians having an ongoing interest to continue to divide those people. We've seen it in recent elections with politicians attempting to divide people between camps, and specifically by using rhetoric surrounding ethos of are you a republican or are you a democrat ergo, entrenching the division not based on policy, but based on identity. We think that's massively problematic. But two, even if yaar's right, even if this is entirely caused by the people themselves, by something inside them deep down that's been dividing them, surely, politicians have enough power, enough political stage, enough media time to pull them back together to an extent, to use the kind of rhetoric that pushes them together more. So even if they didn't create the problem, they can solve it. C, even if they can't solve it they can still cooperate to make better laws at the point at which they are better people representing at the top. Secondly yaar says people will use their vote to harm the party by voting for the worst possible candidate. We think this is highly, highly unlikely. Why? A, note the risk being taken by people who do this is massive. It is literally handing over the united states military to the person who they think is least qualified to hold that position. Crucially, they must recognize, based on yaar's own logic, that it is a big risk, because as he says, it's a prisoner's dilemma, IE the reason to do this is because you know the other side might do it that means that each person opting into this system is well aware that it is potentially possible that if they put in the dumbest person, that person will lead the united states. That is hugely terrifying ! We say people tend to be risk averse, particularly with large, scary decisions. This means that many many people won't act that way. But crucially, b, even if some people do act that way it's important to remember that the entire republican side, for example, is still also voting in the republican primaries. That means that if the democratic side does split its vote between an idiot candidate and a proper central candidate, the republican candidate who represents republican the best is most likely to be the one who wins out within the primaries, and at the very very worst, that means that we haven't improved the situation, while still allowing people to feel they have some more control over their lives, over their futures and over the political discourse. Please support the motion.
We should not abolish the electoral college � country to what sam tells you, we're going to explain why the direct vote is actually not desirable for a democracy and secondly why on our side of the house we get more political will for less privileged areas. So first I want to talk about direct voting because sam essentially tells you that it's undemocratic not to let people have direct representation but rather to have an electoral college that kind of mitigates the directness of that by giving more representation to certain groups and ensuring that there are trustees who maintain the electoral college rather than just voting the way people want them to. On our side we argue that the existing US system undermines tyranny of the majority. Right now there are guarantees that minority groups can still have their voice heard and can still participate in this process. And moreover it ensures that if some antidemocratic populist factions say were to vote in an election that the electoral college would be a check against that influence. In other words we think that the electoral college moderates the worst instincts of the majority and that it ensures that a small majority can't impose their will on everyone else with dramatic harms. We think that representation isn't the only concern of a democracy and this goes directly against everything you heard from sam. We think that stability is also important and it's clear that the electoral college has helped the US to maintain stability. I think that one reason why the US has tended to have fairly moderate governments compared to most other democracies around the world, that is to say there haven't been very many far left or far right governments in the united states, is partly because we have the system of trustees in place. You wouldn't just have to convince the people, who may be naive or politically illiterate, you also have to convince the electors and we think that they absolutely can be a check against someone who is unsuited to the office or a threat to the republic being put into a position of power. So we think that as a result that the electoral college is actually a boon for democracy and could help to maintain democracy in its darkest hour if some sort of populist dictator or populist figure tried to come to power. But our second argument is about how this insures more political will for less privileged areas. There are certain parts of the united states that will always dominate the national scene like new york and california just because they have lots and lots of people and they have major cities where elites live. But as a result even fairly populous areas outside of the coasts, many areas of the interior, don't get a lot of attention politically speaking except for the fact that they have disproportionate representation in some areas of government. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that no senator or representative who doesn't live in wyoming cares if people there live or die. Like most politicians are self serving, they don't care about helping other people, only about getting their own goals achieved. As a result they would probably ignore people in very poor areas of the US like west virginia if it weren't for the fact that those groups are over represented in the electoral college. This forces elites and forces people in wealthier areas to take notice of what's happening in less well off areas and in more rural areas. It prevents a few large cities from ruling over the rest of the country and ignoring their needs. So we think that this is basically a transfer of political power partially from very wealthy privileged areas to much poorer, less privileged areas and therefore that in a sense this actually protects the american people. It ensures that their interests are taken account of even if in a certain sense it takes away the ability of some people to be proportionally represented. And since the system is still somewhat proportional we think that this is a fair trade-off. For all these reasons we should not abolish the electoral college. Thank you.
Before getting to the arguments themselves, we just like to remind everyone that we have already tried prohibiting alcohol before, and all of us know that that didn't go very well. So, we think that there is a huge burden on side government that they cannot conveniently ignore to explain to us why is it that today, when alcohol is becoming even more integral part of our culture and our day to day lives, they think that this is even going to work and not have catastrophic results. Next, let's quickly refute some of the arguments that james has brought up. So first thing he says, is that third parties are getting harmed by consumption of alcohol. Firstly, he talks about how this harms people's health and then society has to pay the price in like terms of more expensive healthcare and so on, and so we ask, well where is the limit james? Are we going to force people to do regular sports? Are we going to force people on a very healthy diet? There's a huge difference between a direct harm to society and an indirect harm to society. And if in every action that I do, I would have to consider the ultimate implications on a macro economic sense to society and stop doing everything that negatively affects it, then I would have to limit myself to, like, we would have to limit many things that people like, starting from hamburgers and like reaching cellphones. We say that's just not a reasonable argument. Then he talks about eh drunk drivers, and he says it's true that there is a law against driving under the influence but it's hard to enforce. We say that, that's just like saying that we should ban kitchen knives because we weren't able to prevent all of the stabbing incidence. Then he talks about physical abuse in women and children, and again, obviously the abuse itself is forbidden by law, and we think that there are many other sources or elements that have contributed to people that are being abusive, we simply do not agree that alcohol itself is to blame here. Nextly, he speaks about the asymmetry of information between like the the one that manufactures alcohol and the one that consumes it. And he says that people don't understand that alcohol is dangerous and that the manufacturers are taking advantage of this. Well, give people more information like you do with cigarettes when you put warnings on the packets. We don't hear any explanation from james why is this inherently the case that there there will always be a lack of information and we think that it's probably because such explanation just doesn't exist. And lastly he talks about consistency, he doesn't want to prioritize one lifestyle over another. And we say great, we're all for it, we're all for consistency and in our opinion, marijuana needs to be legal as well. Onto our constructive points, which is alcohol as liberating tool from the yoke of social conformity. Look, it's true that alcohol has its negative sides but in a debate you have to be comparative. The great thing that comes with alcohol stems exactly from the way in which it it's blurs our inhibitions, because it makes us forget for a minute, this inner voice that tell us oh no, what are people going to say. And we say that in a society that often polices its members to conform to norms, without the ability to truly criticize them or reflect upon them, we think that that is crucial. Think about the gay kid in the closet in a conservative community, that is forced to hide his identity and suffer from it, during the course of his life. We say that to him and to many others like him one glass of whiskey can make the difference between liberation and ongoing suffering. That is also the reason that alcohol has played a lead role in all types of social revolutions in history, because people were able to, for a second, shut down their urge to conform. Government wants to take all of that away from us. Please oppose.
Imagine if a community leader in harlem came up to the mayor and said hey guy, my community could really use a new road. Maybe just more than one subway train that goes anywhere near our neighborhood. It wouldn't be difficult for you all to understand that he'd be turned down. It would be clear to you why he'd be turned down. Because the mayor cares more about white upper west side and lower east side where all the rich people live and can influence him more and make sure he gets reelected, and so the poor people get thrown aside, they get thrown under the bus. The same thing happens with states. And that's what we're goinna talk to you about in this speech, how congressional earmarks allow states to overcome being born unequal and disadvantaged. Three points of refutation before that. One, he says congress's job is to allocate is to allocate funding and the executive is supposed to determine how you spend it. That sounds like it's being upkept. Congress allocates funding for a road between a and b, the executive decides which contractor to hire, what kind of road to build, AKA how you spend it. He says, look, saying the highway should pass between all these towns, is spending way more money on things you don't need. Really, congress's job is to allocate the funding, IE to determine whether or not all those towns maybe need access to a highway so they can get jobs in other towns because otherwise they're stuck in their poverty with no ability to exit it. It sounds like congress is doing exactly what it's supposed to be doing. Secondly, he says this creates distrust and resentment. Yes, this is what's creating the distrust and resentment between the democrats and the republicans, come on. Three he says, there are promises where called the pork barrel spending, if you reelect me, I will get e and y done in this town. That sounds like campaign promises. Politicians use this everywhere m it's not particularly related to the way in which they insure these promises get upkept. It it honestly sounds like finally there are politicians who are sticking to their word but, if anything, their problem is with no term limits which wer'e fine with supporting. Let's talk into, talk about, how not all states were born equal. A congress's job is to ensure the benefit of his constituents, meaning the people from their state. However, states are quite unequal which causes problems for these states. Why are they unequal? A different states have different amounts of money, b different states have different sizes. This both means that they have less money because there are fewer people in the state, and fewer people means fewer votes which is problematic for things like choosing the executive, because it means they have less impact on the system as a whole, and three, they are different geographically. So, for example states on the coast have been where trade happens because they happen to be on the coast, so those states have become richer and more powerful over time meanwhile states in midland, all they have is farmland and since farmland is not particularly prosperous, they end up with less economic power. What is the problem that that creates? These these states need more federal spending because they cannot spend locally money that they do not have. However, because they have less money and less power, they also have less sway over federal spending, where does the solve come in? Specifically through congressional earmarks. Why? Because congress,thanks to the equality within the senate, is the one place where they have almost an equal say. The one place where a congressman a senator from missouri is equal to a senator from california. Earmarked spending is the one way that weaker states have the ability to make sure that that gap doesn't grow. And in fact, get somewhat smaller, that they have that highway that they get built that new company that insures that they still have jobs next year. We think that is a wonderful thing, and we beg you to oppose.
Don't have year-round schooling. Danny creates an elaborate redistribution of the days off during vacation. Short breaks where he says that people are going to have the same amount of time off just distributed over the year differently but the problem here is that we just don't think that short breaks are the same personally or functionally. You can't do the same amount of stuff, people are less likely to hire you. Like a lot of the benefits we think are not about whether or not you can go on vacation, which is basically the only example that danny focuses on, rather it's about if you are someone who needs to get a job, if you're someone who wants to have an internship, these kinds of things can't happen over the course of one month rather they need a span of an entire summer to actually do them. Two three main arguments: first, on being better for children. Danny is wrong about the way that students respond to breaks and which system for breaks is better. We think that summer break is a is a really good time to decompress in a way that other breaks simply aren't. School is something that is exhausting emotionally, physically, mentally. It forces children to a strict into to stick to a very strict and stringent schedule, stay seated for hours of the day and interact in controlled social interactions with populations of individuals they likely don't want to be interacting with. These are conditions that adults are capable of dealing with because adults are more developed and have built up more stamina but for children this is a pretty high ask especially since physically children have more energy and require more time outside and being physically active than adults do. It's also bad for their emotional and mental development to be overloaded with work. Summer break is a good way of creating more of a balance when it comes to works. It still prepares kids for the real world and provides them with the positive parts of education learning and other skills but still gives a long enough uninterrupted period of freedom that they don't get too overwhelmed. Danny says " look you're going to have a lot of short breaks that let you decompress " but this just doesn't isn't the way it works. Like if anything we've seen studies where individuals are given four day instead of two day weekends and we see that the productivity during the rest of the week rises rapidly because we know that short breaks are simply less effective than longer ones and allow an individual to feel like the decompressed. But moreover, recognize that in the status quo children have relatively regular breaks as is, right? You get time off for thanksgiving, spring break, like big holidays. It's not as if it like winter break tends to be pretty long like it's not as if you're just off for summer break and then in the school the rest. We get a positive that danny attempts to co-opt but can't because the status quo already includes those breaks. Summer prevents fatigue while year-round schooling would exist would exhaust kids to the point that they would feel like education is unenjoyable. This is how we see burnout happen in a lot of countries that have these kinds of systems. People go through year-round school before college are burned out by the time they go to higher learning and can't perform as well as they would. Our second argument is that it's important for extracurriculars. It gives the opportunity to do something besides school. The first independent point applies best to elementary and middle schools kids but we think that summer is really important for high schoolers as well. During the school year you rarely have time for anything besides classes and school focused extracurriculars. Some kids squeeze in a job but that's pretty difficult. You don't have the time to throw yourself into intense products or full time job positions. Summer gives an uninterrupted span of time in which high schoolers can do things like extra classes at a nearby university or pick up an internship and this is good both on a personal level and in terms of building their resumes for college which we think is something that everyone should be thinking about when they're trying to prepare for college. Our third argument is about how this is better for low income kids. Summer provides a span of time when people have to work to help provide their family can build a little bit of a nest egg or at least contribute more to make up for the time during the year that they won't be able to work for the same extent. This lets people strike a more healthy work-life balance. There are large populations of kids who are lower middle class who don't have enough money to not have to work but if they can put up their hours over the summer they can do less during their class time. It'll let the people who will need to work anyway make redistribute they're working in a way that is better for them so they can make more money in a shorter period of time. Proud to oppose.
So we think that side government rightfully categorizes the two cases that are relevant to the issue of prenatal diagnosis, the first being kids who might be born with all types of severe diseases, terminal diseases, and this tool allows parents to prematurely terminate the pregnancy. The truth is that we don't really have a lot of opposition here. We don't we can't really argue, we accept this harm, but the thing is that they themselves admit, side government themselves admit, that these cases are very are very few in number compared to the second group, which is kids who are just born with less serious disabilities and that, like, children that will have to face all types of special challenges, and they require special care. And we're being told is that , you know, parents just don't always know what's required and as soon as we allow them to know ahead of time, then they could, you know, do their homework, can be better prepared at that moment of actual birth. So, to this we say, like, really that is all of the harm that they are able to to point out. What's the delta here? The two or three or four months of knowing in advance. We don't really understand what's so significant about this. They tell us that this way, the child could immediately receive all of the all of the attention and and special care that he requires without the adjustment period. But we don't really understand, up until the very end of the speech, like on which preparations are they talking about that couldn't simply be made after the baby is born. And we say that even if things take awhile to settle, I mean it's not like the baby is going to remember his first few months in life. So, really, we just don't understand what's the big added benefit here. The second thing that they do is say that it helps the parents better mentally prepare themselves for the situation. But we would say that we don't think that you can seriously argue that these few extra months are enough in order to learn how to cope with the fact that you were that you have a child with a disability. We say that the that the process of accepting that is a lot longer and you have no way of, you know, preparing yourself in advance. It is not up until the moment where you get to see with your own eyes that your kid is different that you can start truly experiencing all of the difficult like all of the mental difficulties that come with this. This like we're talking about something that parents usually take a lot of years and a lot of therapy to really overcome. So, here as well, it's just unclear to us what is the contribution of this, you know, early information. So now let's move on to talk about the harms of prenatal diagnosis. And what we in opposition are afraid from is the scenario in which people are about to give birth to disabled children and once they find out, they will choose to abort them. Now again, we're not talking about severe defects but any diagnosis, even the most simple one. If I find out that my kid suffers from autism or that he's blind or deaf or physically handicapped in any way. So we think that many parents will just prefer to abort this child rather than to have to face and deal with the difficulties. And why is that so bad? Well because we believe that this will have a devastating effect on the efforts of the disabled community to fit in in society. We think that processes like prenatal diagnosis and and selection are strengthening the stigma or the social convention that we have today that people with disabilities are a mistake of nature and are worthy of pity or that they are a burden on society, rather than people just seeing them as a different and challenging, yet no way less deserving, form of living. We honestly think that a lot of the hardships of those people lies with the ignorance of society and the fear of everything that's slightly different from the norm. And we think that that, like, as soon as people can simply avoid giving birth to to children with disabilities, they will become far less visible in the in the public sphere, and people will have far less reasons to support their political struggles and because, you know, they know that they they don't have this fear that their children might enjoy the fruits of these struggles as well, and so on and so forth. And for all of these reasons, we're very proud to oppose.
We shouldn't increase immigration to the US. Two main arguments: first on increasing islamophobia and immigrant hatred. People see immigrants as competition for their jobs, college slots and common resources. If you increase the amount especially in current political conditions where we have a really really extremist republican president who has no problem using fearmongering language and insulting cultural minorities, it just means that people will be blaming them more and more for any issues we might come into. You're going to have situations of increased violence and harassment and discrimination and the problem is going to be that that these harms will fall not just on individuals who have newly immigrated but also against all immigrants who were previously in the country even those who have been there for a long time. You need to prioritize protecting the immigrants that we let in and you can't do that if it is a high amount that distorts public perception of immigration in general. James talks about humanitarianism. He says that we have an obligation to help these people because we have harmed their countries in the past and this is potentially true but we think that it applies to the majority of western colonialist bodies. So sure, the US should take immigrants and it does in the status quo but it is not uniquely obligated to take in immigrants compared to say countries like the UK or other eurozone nations or france and even if it is true that we have this obligation given that they are likely going to face increased violence and discrimination in the US as well, we don't think we're being very humane by increasing immigration. James spent some time talking about the spirit of america. He says that we are a country of immigrants and we grow from them and it is still the case that the US except a very large amount of immigrants but also we don't think we have an obligation to reflect back on that if it isn't beneficial for the US. So the fact that at some point in time we were a country that only took immigrants, doesn't reflect the fact that over time our needs and desires as a nation change. Our second argument is about messing up US infrastructure. We don't have the infrastructure to sustain large influxes of immigration. We don't have things like enough language centers, housing, transitional facilities and it means that if we increase immigration we're going to have to have we're going to have massive difficulties with sustaining and placing those people into productive lives and jobs. We think it is better to have smaller amounts of immigration but be able to accommodate a seamless transition into US life fully. This also extends to things like healthcare and housing infrastructure. We just don't have the ability for our healthcare system to accommodate so many people when they're likely not to have the money early on. Immigrants tend to aggregate near the site at which they enter the country so finding ways to displace them into areas that have available housing is going to be hard. James talks about economic growth but this can only happen if the transition a successful. If immigrants are getting gummed up in the system, they can't do things like start the businesses that james wants them to start. But also if the GDP doubles but the population also doubles that doesn't mean that anyone is getting a higher quality of life or getting richer. We think that james is using bad standards because he's not considering the proportions between the nation's output and the people within it. We also just think that this gets outweighed by the fact that the general population gets angry and starts doing things like electing more extreme politicians because they don't appreciate the fact that they now feel like they are competing with these immigrants. We think that you have to recognize the majority of the rhetoric of conservative republicans and conservative individuals is that they are really upset at the idea that these immigrants might be stealing their jobs and aren't going to be dealing with the truth of whether or not this is something that is happening in reality on either side. So it is enough that these people can fearmonger and say that these immigrants are bad to harm every immigrant that exists in the united states. Don't do that. Proud to oppose.
We should not prohibit slum tourism. We think that, ultimately, despite many valid arguments the government side brings up, that slum tourism has immense potential to improve the lives of the people that are in these slums. The first thing that we want to point out, though, is that the model that the government side presents, we think, is just infeasible. They say tourist countries should ban these types of behaviors, but we think it's impossible, in practical terms, to actually prevent people from traveling to the favelas of brazil in in real terms. We think that people are still going to do this, even if it's under the table, despite what the government says, and so it's unlikely this policy will ever be effective and, therefore, should not be taken. But disregarding that, let's get into their actual arguments. The first argument they make is that slum tourism is degrading to the people in slums because they are being put on display. He compares them to being put on display like zoo animals and that they have no choice to opt out of this, it's not like they choose to be in the slums. We think that this is true. We think that in many ways slum tourism can be degrading to people that live in these areas, but it also provides potential benefits to people in these areas. For example, it opens up an entire tourism industry in the favelas of brazil, for example. It allows them to have businesses that people will shop at. It allows them to open their own tourist venues, and it allows for money to come into these areas where they otherwise would not be going there. We think that this can allow for the social mobility that actually leads to long-term changes for the people in these areas. And, yes, while in the short term, it may be degrading, we think that, ultimately, if at the end of the day there is the potential for economic mobility, it outweighs the short-term harm. The second argument under this is that it undermines empathy in that people don't go on to help in the future. It is absolutely true that many of the people that go to these areas and do slum tourism ultimately come out without making any sort of change. But we think that it doesn't take an immense amount it doesn't take the majority of people to make change, it just takes a few dedicated people. And while we think at the very at the very worst, this is probably a net neutral in empathy. Even if you go in and leave and you do nothing, you probably wouldn't have done anything beforehand, but at least slum tourism provides the potential to bridge the empathy gap, an emplathy gap that has no other way to be bridged. And we think many people, maybe not the majority, but many people do come home and at least for some time want to be active in trying to address the problems that are being created in these areas. And we think that that is another way to provide some sort of mobility for these people. If outside sources are willing to invest money in these areas, if they're willing to lobby their state to provide more funds to these countries, then we think that is, again, a net gain. And while the degradation of slum tourism is a reality, we think that the actual harms that people face because they live in the slums vastly outweighs this and if we provide any sort of marginal gain against that, we think we win this round. They say this provides a harm to traditional tourist industries, but we don't think this is a real tradeoff. If I'm going to go pay to fly to brazil, if I'm going to do slum tourism, it doesn't mean I'm not going to go to the beaches of brazil and go and explore rio and do all these other fun things. It just means I'm doing one other thing on my trip. So we don't think that this is a valid tradeoff. The final argument they make is that slum tourism is unsafe and that it's a waste of money to police these areas just to protect tourists. Well, first, we think if it's true that these areas are unsafe, then it's probably good that more policing is being invested in these areas, because it also helps the people that live in these areas that there's more protection from the dangers in these areas for them as well. But, ultimately, we don't think that it's necessary that governments make these choices. We're fine with the government of these countries not spending on this and just allowing people to make the choice for themselves whether or not they want to take on the risk. Ultimately, we think slum tourism is an avenue to mobility for people that really have no avenue in the status quo and for these reasons, we should not prohibit slum tourism.
School uniform are important because they help protect children that come from poor families and help them feel included in the school. Before I reach this argument, allow me to respond to the points that were brought up by the prime minister. So the first thing that was brought up is that school uniform stand in the way of the children to express their creativity and sense of individuality. Two answers here. A: we simply disagree. We think that there are a million and one other ways in which you could stand out, not through the tee shirt that you're wearing and children, specifically, usually have no problem finding such ways. You want to be creative and special, go to art class, go play the drums, go do whatever it is that you want. Nobody's going to stop you. Second answer: we say that even if it is true to an extent, we simply don't care too much about every kid getting to feel that he is the most special thing in the world. We say that if we show you that by canceling school uniform, we're going to create a situation that will make it a lot harder for certain students to fit in and to feel welcome, then with all due respect to the feeling of individuality of the children, it can wait until after hour after school hours. The second thing that we're being told is that school uniforms aren't comfortable enough. I'm sorry but this is not a serious argument. I mean, come on. If this is the problem, we can easily solve it by allowing a few possible versions of the uniform, you know, short sleeve, long sleeve, etcetera, and each student can simply choose the version that's most comfortable for him. Again, with all due respect, this is not so important. Lastly, we hear that there is no positive impact that comes out of school uniform and that it's all just assertions. But seeing as this was basically said as an assertion itself, without any analysis, I find it a little funny. So, let's move on to explain the positive impact of uniform. We say that children can be pretty cruel sometimes, especially to whoever is different from them. There are a few ways in which you can be different. It can be on the basis of appearance: if I am overweight, if the color of my skin is different, it can be in my religion or my sexual orientation and, obviously, it can be in socioeconomic status. If my parents don't have enough money to send me to school in fancy clothing like the rest of the children then, in the worst case scenario, I might actually be subjected to social preclusion. But even if not, I start to develop a sense of inferiority. I feel uncomfortable in my own skin. This is a feeling that accompanies me everywhere, including into the classroom, and I just simply cannot run away from. We say that if it is possible to at least allow these children the chance of, you know, getting free from all of this, from this feeling of inferiority, at least while they're in the school where they are supposed to be able to sit in the classroom and study and to focus and concentrate without feeling unwelcome, without having to worry about their social status. We say that if we could do something about it, then this is something that we must do, and by implementing the school uniform, we say that at least we are giving them the chance of being released from all of this. Therefore, we call you to oppose the motion.
We should not subsidize investigative journalism. So we think that in theory the government's idea of subsidizing investigative journalism to create a more robust press, a more informed public, that these are nice ideas but we think that in actuality the way that a system like this would work would likely undercut the end goals of investigative journalism and do ultimately more harm than good. So the first argument that the government makes is actually ironically enough about promoting free press and that a democracy requires like a free press in order to be functioning and informed and all of those things and in and we don't agree we don't disagree with that. A free press is great. An informed public is great. These are all great things but what we think this subsidy actually does is creates a dependency on the state for these things to happen. So look at news organizations in the status quo that are already struggling with the decrease in subscriptions, with the increase of free media elsewhere, we think that they would probably jump on board just to keep some sort of funding going for their own systems for these grants. But that means that this investigative journalism is now tied directly to the state and we think that this means that people are going to be deterred from doing robust reporting on the state because they know that that grant can just be revoked from them if they anger the people that are in power and obviously this is problematic. We would rather have a somewhat smaller form of investigative journalism where maybe there's less of it going on but that the quality of it is higher, that more people are being informed about things that matter the most in a way that can really check against the state but we don't think that's likely to happen if all of the sudden the people that are writing about the state are also getting paid by the state. We think it creates a perverse incentive to, not just for the state but also for journalists, to try and be the ones that are getting these grants, to try and be in favor of the state. So we think that ultimately in order to have this free press it needs to be free from being tied with the state itself which is why it should not provide this subsidy. The second argument that they make is that this this form of subsidizing investigative journalism can undercut the kind of rising tide of conservatism and fascism that exists in the state in in many states today by kind of exposing them. I think they I don't understand why this why this subsidy would only be going to liberal media outlets nor why that would be a good thing. Like we think that first, conservative values in and of themselves are not necessarily bad but if we're going to fascism which seems to be what the government's focusing on, we think that if if a fascist state is the one that's doing it, it is even more likely that what we said above is true and that these grants are just going to be going to conservative or fascist news organizations so that they can if nothing else expose the opposition for the for the skeletons that they have in their closet making the fascist look even better, like making the fascist look comparatively better. So we think that in the states that the government is talking about, it's even more likely that what we talked about in our first argument is going to come to fruition and it's again going to make sure that these people are more likely to be entrenched in power so long as the opposition seems to be the bad guy. We think that it's ultimately unlikely that these types of state would take any sort of action to harm itself and that this is again nice in theory, but isn't going to come to execution in a way that's good. They say that as a as a kind of touch off point that you can also keep corporations accountable. But we think that this is probably outweighed by investigative journalism unit that is unable to report on those that essentially are still controlling the corporations, have the power that being the government. Finally they say that as a last point it's good to encourage people to go in the humanities fields. This is true but we just don't see why this requires subsidizing investigative journalism directly. Like you can subsidize people getting humanities degrees. We just don't think that that is a winning argument in this and for these reasons, we should not subsidize investigative journalism.
We think that there is value in what we shall name an innocent childhood without sexual awareness. We do not think that side government is going to disagree with us so we're not gonna bother to much in explaining why. They would simply say that that it is the limit of that time period which is in question. What we're going to do is explain why if we follow government's logic and start lowering the age of consent, we're going to find ourselves in a very dangerous process where there is no clear boundary and that slowly but surely erases the ability of our children to grow in an innocent environment completely. Before we start, some relevant information. Because eitan says that he wants to lower this age from eighteen to somewhere between fourteen and sixteen. Well, to the best of our knowledge in most places around the world, including in the united states, the legal age of consent moves between seventeen to sixteen to even fifteen in certain states, so obviously we think it would be a little bit ridiculous to just argue, like, to change it and to lower it for one year, so we think this debate intends for there to be a significant lowering of the age of consent, which already sets the bar somewhere between twelve to fourteen, just to set the record straight. Now, obviously no matter where we set this bar it's going to be somewhat random in the sense that in certain cases this bar is going to be too low and in other particular cases it's going to be too high, but side government also understands that we have to set the bar somewhere and the thing is that no matter where we set it we have to take into account that there are, there's like always a certain erosion in the way that people actually follow these laws. This is a law that is by nature not allowing the state or the police to enforce it strictly. At best we only find out about like five to ten percent of the cases where people break this law. This is much like speed signs where it is clear to us that people are always going to be driving like ten to fifteen percent faster than what is legally allowed. So the number that appears in these laws is some sort of anchor that dictates the general area of ages in which people are going to, like, in which children are going to have sex with adults. And we have to be conscious of the fact that if we are going to lower this anchor to, say fourteen, this means that we have to be willing to accept that in many cases this means this applies de facto for children in the age of twelve or thirteen. Now why is that so bad? So we hear from eitan about the physiological changes and the changes in social norms that have brought our children to be better equipped and more ready to have sex in younger ages. We have two things to say about that: first thing, like, both these things don't necessarily mean a better cognitive or mental adaptation that is required to to be truly ready to have sexual intercourse. So even if our children are expressing sexual behavior or become more curious and exposed to sexuality, this does not mean that they have developed the mental maturity that will allow them to safely engage in actual sexual acts. Second thing to say here is that we think that the changes in social norms just continue on happening in a pattern of, like, an ongoing race to younger and younger ages. This happens, among other things, because sex sells and because there are financial interests at play. And they are happening way faster than the physical adaptations that are required to, like, that's that require an actual evolutionary like biological process. This takes time. This means that as our children are not really physically ready to have sex, the social norm is increasingly becoming more and more open to the to the idea that they are, with every passing generation and this means that we're going to have to continue on lowering the age of consent more and more and as a result children are going to be taken advantage of. Even if without any like malicious intent and they will have to be forced to live with the damages of having sex before they are mentally prepared. So please oppose.
We agree with side government that we need to rely more heavily on renewable energy to try and avoid a global warming catastrophe. This is not the clash. The clash here is whether the right way to do so is by further exploiting specifically hydroelectric dams or other forms of renewable energy, such as solar power and wind power, that are far less damaging to the environment which is, after all, what we are all out to protect here in this debate. This is the relevant comparison, and there are only two things that were said by the previous speaker that address this particular comparison. Number one, he says that we can more easily deploy the many more hydroelectric dams than , you know, wind turbines or solar panels, because all you need is running water as opposed to wind or solar power, which is more weather dependent. This point is quite simply false. There are plenty more areas that are fit for installing wind turbines or solar panels than there are rivers big enough and with the appropriate geographical conditions for installing more hydroelectric dams. Now, this is like obviously that's the case and it's also common sense, because you get wind and sun literally everywhere whereas rivers, well, not so much. Also, it is far easier to just stick a turbine or a solar panel than to build a dam. So, the truth of the matter is simply that like the the truth is on the opposite side of what they argued. Number two, they tell us that since the technology of hydroelectric dams is more developed, then it then it would require require less investment flowing into r and d, and we can simply put all of the money to work and start building dams. These are exactly the types of claims that we should be very, very worried about: we needn't improve, we need not check if there are better alternatives, what we have is good enough. No, no, no, no, no. That's exactly how you reach the technological stagnation that leads to an inefficient exploitation of resources that might lead to a global disaster. This is exactly why the other, less explored alternatives are the ones that should that we should endeavor to further explore, rather than say then like just stay in our comfort zone and and just stick to what we know. Now here are some things that tim doesn't tell you about hydroelectric dams. If you haven't gotten to see one, then you should definitely go and see these dams. They are massive. These are monsters. We're not talking about minor neglectible environmental harms, as tim would have you believe. We are talking about seriously tampering with the direction of the river's water flow, sometimes creating huge floods or huge droughts. Both things can create irreversible damage to all the crops being raised on the riverside. We are talking about polluting the drinking water of entire towns or villages. We are talking about annihilating entire populations of fish that that used to live in that river. Now, note that all of these consequences are consequences that we could have very easily avoided, when and if we just opt for exploiting wind power or solar power. The more that we invest in these options, the more that we help protecting our planet and our environment. For all these reasons, please propose.
For a lot of this debate, proposition is simply off clash. This debate is not about having the technology to do instant replays in general. Note that exists today, sport networks do it all the time. It's about enabling that technology during the game in a way that allows to overturn calls. So, within that framework, their first argument is relevant and we'll address it, but arguments about deterring cheating because people know they can get caught due to instant replay, or proper punishment because people can be seen exactly as they've acted, are just irrelevant. All of that can happen today and we have no problem with it. Two arguments in today's debate. One, on sporting as a feat of human capabilities and a referee being part of that sport, and two on the ability to hack the sport. Before that, two points of rebuttal. So first, they talk about faith in referees. They say, we wanna know the ref is doing a good job. Two arguments. A, we dispute the notion that people feel less invested in the sport when they think the referee can be wrong. We think the ability for human error makes people more invested in the sport. But note that, pl players, do not become less invested in their team members because those can have errors or mess up, in fact, they become more invested because the ability for ups and downs, highs and lows, is what makes the sport so intricate and intriguing. B, as it stands, you can review it later. This means you do know when refs make wrong calls. If that is a particular issue then obviously, you can get rid of referees who consistently make wrong calls. Next he says the ref is willing to change the call when he has the evidence. Well, obviously the debate is about whether that's a good thing, no explanation was given. We'll explain in the first argument why it's a bad thing. Lastly, he talks to us about rigging matches. Look, we already tell you why it's not particularly relevant to the motion at hand. We will talk to you however in the second argument about hacking the sport, and where the real rigging can and will start happening. First, let's talk about sporting as an event of human capacity. Look, proposition tells you when things like instant replay are available, you lose things like gamesmanship and sportsmanship. That's exactly our point. We think sport exists for the enjoyment of the viewer. We think the fallibility of the referees is part of the sport. Otherwise referees wouldn't exist in the first place, and you would just have a few doped up players playing as well as they can, being judged by a computerized point system. The idea that the referee has to be in it, part of it, calling it alongside the other players is what makes it, so involved and so interesting for the players. To the extent that the benefit of sport is not in how well people are playing, note if that were true we would all be fine with doping in sport, but rather, in how much the fans can enjoy it, we think the fallibility of referees is part of that viewership experience. Secondly, hacking the sport. So, look, they tell us on opposition, it's really difficult to rig matches because you have to get lots of people involved. They're right, and we add to that, not only are you involving lots of people, but you're involving specifically players, refs, coaches, people who opt into a sport as a religion, as a way of life, people who are the least likely to harm the integrity of the sport. What happens when mechanized calls start playing a part in this. The problem with computerized systems is that they invariably can be hacked. Note the incentive to hack these systems at the point at which the referees will likely change calls, like they say on the other side, is quite high if you take into account things like sports betting. When you open up that capability to people who are substantially less invested in the sport and can more easily then cheat, because they no longer have to have the access to people like refs, coaches and players, you open up this sporting to more outside meddling in the worst form. For all these reasons, please oppose the motion.
We should not abolish the two-party system. In my speech, I'm going to talk about two things: first, stability, and second, why the alternative is actually giving more power to political parties and less to the people. So, first, stability. If you look at the list of countries with the most peaceful transition of power, you'll notice a couple of things: one, that britain and the US have far more peaceful transitions of power than any other country, and two, that all of the top countries have two-party political systems. We would tell you that this isn't a coincidence, that a two-party system tends to lend itself to stable government and to maintaining the same constitution for long periods of time. The reasons are pretty simple. First, you don't have to have coalition governments, and second, that historically this has worked and therefore, countries that implement this are likely to adopt other good policies. But really only the first is important for our debate. Coalition governments are really bad. Sam tells you that he wants to implement a system wherein there are five major parties in the US. This is kind of comparable to the situation in germany right now where there are five or sometimes six parties in the bundestag. Why doesn't that work well for germany which, I would point out, is a country with a good economy and a strong tradition of democracy, so probably like the best-case point of comparison for the other side of this debate? It doesn't work very well because it means that in order to form a government, all of the parties have to offer concessions to small minority parties, which then lead to weird inefficiencies in government. So, for instance, in germany, you could have the christian democrats, who are the main right-wing party, win the election but rely on the christian social union, a party from bavaria, to be able to form a government. As a result, they now have to go along with whatever their minority partner want in order to establish a government. So if that means that this minority party is anti-gay rights and the christian democrats, the larger party, are more favorable to gay rights, they can't allow for those reforms because their government would collapse, and this way minority parties can hold your government hostage. You're more likely to have votes of no confidence, and you're more likely to have strange policy effects just as a result of the fact that these minority viewpoints are able to impose their will on everyone else. Sam portrays this as though it gives a voice to minorities, but we would argue that it actually takes away the voice of large majorities in some cases, because these minority parties become kingmakers, if you will, in these multi-party parliaments, and that's kind of best case. You may have heard that france is in the fifth french republic. Well, the third and fourth both collapsed because of interparty rivalries that made them impossible to govern. So we can see that there's a tradition of even strong democratic countries having having to rewrite their constitutions essentially, because of interparty disputes that arise from not having a two-party system, and I think that you need stability in order to have long-term planning for the economy, for people to plan their own lives and, therefore, that we're much better off with a two-party system. But our second argument is that the alternative gives even more power to parties. Sam says that people right now just vote based on if there's a republican or democrat next to a candidate's name, but that gets even worse if there are more parties. Why? Parties are going to run what are called party lists, where they assign seats to people based on their seniority in the party, like they do now in britain or germany or france, rather than picking people from a given area. So as a result, we think it's likely that the power will now rest entirely with the parties and less so with the people who live in a given area, because they'll now be even more beholden to these political parties. The only reason it doesn't happen right now is that neither party wants to be the first mover, but with five parties that obstacle is gone. For all of these reasons, we should not abolish the two-party system. Thank you.
We should not protect the right to internet access. On our side, we're going to explain to you, first of all, why this is an arbitrary right that has no foundation and shouldn't be enforced for that reason and, secondly, about why this would require provision of access and why that's a bad thing. So, first, we tell you that rights can derive from a few different sources and that this right doesn't derive from any of them. First of all, rights could be derived from nature. So people probably have some sort of right to life just by virtue of the fact that they are alive. Even if we didn't live in a state that could grant us rights, we think that people would still have the right to life, but plainly the internet isn't affected by that because it doesn't exist in the state of nature. Rights could come from god and, although it's been a long time, I remember him being rather silent on the matter of internet access, so I guess we don't have that. And finally, rights can be derived from convention but to my knowledge, in no country in the world do the majority of people want to implement a law that would require the government to provide everyone with internet access, more on that in just a moment, nor does any country constitutionally enshrine the right to internet access. So if rights don't come from nature, god or convention, then I'm very curious where they come from. At that point, we tell you that there simply is no right to internet access, so it would be preposterous for the government to try to enforce this and to offer it to people. Will tries to justify this by saying that it's a facilitative right, but why doesn't that make any sense? Well, there are infinite facilitative rights to almost any right we do have. Will says that internet access is necessary to facilitate freedom of speech, but you know what? It would probably be difficult to get the most out of that internet access without a smartphone or an internet device. So does the state now have an obligation to give everybody a samsung? It would probably be difficult to access that without access to some sort of hotspot. So does the state have to give everybody a free router? Does the state have to install wifi in every public place so that people can always get online? Does the state need to lay out cables to very remote areas where it's cost prohibitive to provide the internet? Right? There're infinite facilitative rights to this facilitative right, which I think shows why the idea of facilitative rights is a poor way to establish a rights framework. If a right doesn't derive from those three sources I mentioned earlier, nature, god, and convention, then it probably isn't a right and, therefore, we think that everything will tells you about why this is necessary to allow freedom of speech just kind of falls out of the round because it's absurd. Our second argument is that this would require provision of access. Giving people the right to internet access and not giving them internet access would achieve nothing. So even if you accept that this right isn't absurd, we think that we would have to defend a world in which the government gives everyone the ability to actually take advantage of the internet, otherwise, we think that there would be no point in doing this. Why is that harmful? Well, the government has limited funds. So we think that because money is fungible, those funds for the internet would come away from other things. And, moreover, governments have discretionary and non-discretionary things that they spend on. So we think that this would have to trade off with other government programs, like tuition subsidies, that are discretional, but that are also clearly much more important to people's well-being than, say, internet access. We think that a tradeoff with education or roads or other more essential goods is just unacceptable. So unless will is telling you that governments would massively raise taxes to provide internet to people, which they simply couldn't do, we think it's very likely that this right would be hollow and meaningless even if it did exist. For all of these reasons, we should not protect the right to internet access. Thank you.
We should not abolish capital punishment. In this round we're fine taking the stance that capital punishment should be limited to extremely certain and very few cases. That only the most heinous of crimes should be treated with capital punishment, that the appeal process should be allowed to be lengthy and that people should be allowed to to take justice to its fullest extent if they wish to appeal it. But that being said, we think that in certain instances people have done crimes that are so heinous and we are certain of those heinous actions that they have forfeited their right to life and that the only proportional response, the only just response is capital punishment. So let's get into the government's arguments and explain why we don't think that they are sufficient for abolishing capital punishment. The first argument is that the there's a risk of killing innocents and that forensics have shown, especially in the last couple of decades, that many people have been falsely convicted. Not just under the death penalty but under you know crimes of all shapes and sizes. We agree that this is definitely the case which is why we should limit the death penalty and not abolish it. We should make sure that when we're applying the death penalty were doing so only in instances in which we are certain that the person that committed the crime is guilty. And there are instances like this. For example, look at the mass shootings that have that have occurred in the united states. Whether it's the charleston shooting or the shooting at the aurora movie theater. We were able to apprehend the person that did this and we know with one hundred percent certainty that they are guilty of the crimes that they've committed. Now some may say that these people were not mentally stable and some may say that they can't be held accountable for their crimes but I think that that is ridiculous. When you're talking about the amount of pain that these people have caused, the fore thought that they had of the pain that they caused, the amount of damage that they've done. Putting someone in jail for the rest of their life, where they can just live out their life on the government's money is not a sufficient response. The families of these of the victims want justice. Society wants justice. They want to deter acts like this in the future and the only sufficiently for doing that is through the is through capital punishment. So maybe we shouldn't use it if we're not a hundred percent certain. Maybe we should limit the death penalty to a significant degree. But when we are certain and when crimes are as heinous as those we think that it is absolutely justified to use capital punishment. The second argument is that this is an abuse of state power because the state has a monopoly on violence and ultimately when there's a huge power imbalance between two sides the powerful side, that being the state must use it responsibly. But we think it is responsible to proportionally punish crimes that are committed with in the state's jurisdiction. In fact this is what the vast majority of people would want. People want to know that if a crime is committed against them that the state will will respond justly and will ensure that their rights are upheld to the furthest extent possible. But even if you think that this is an abuse of state power, we think that the criminals that we're talking about in instances of capital punishment are people that have forfeited their rights. If you do something like the charleston shooting and kill a dozen individuals that we're just doing nothing but worshiping at a church, you forfeited your right to life. You've shown that you have no belief in the value in the sanctity of life and therefore we should have no reason to value the life that you live. They say that there's no way to appeal this thing. We're fine with having a lengthy appeal process. And the final thing they say is people recognize over time and you can see in trends that the death penalty can punish fewer and fewer things and that you should just take this to its furthest extreme. But we think that that's nonsense. We think that just because we've recognized that maybe stealing a loaf of bread isn't worth death penalty doesn't mean that crimes that we viscerally understand to be as heinous as mass murder shouldn't be punished with capital punishment. For these reasons we should not abolish capital punishment.
Don't lower the age of consent. James' model is stupid because it is basically the status quo. Recognize that the that sixteen is already the age of consent in the majority of states. So what we should really be talking about is a much younger age of consent than what james is pretending it is. Don't let him score a lot of the motion this way, force him to recognize the actual impact of his action. In response to this kind of model, we're going to debate the round as though it's about sixteen year olds. But I want you to recognize that the implications of a lower age of consent is that you also lower the age of the kind of like margin of error or standard deviation on that consent, which means his side of the house is having like fourteen year olds who are more likely to be sexually active because the age of consent has been lowered. Moreover the age of consent doesn't actually prevent minors from having sex, but it does allow them to more easily push for legal action if they are being taken advantage of. So we'd say that there's a we'd say that this is actually a really big difference in terms of the legal outcomes because it's just not the case that you get the majority of the impacts that james is worried about unfairly, right? Like you're not going to have people who were sexting at sixteen on the sex offender list just because it's very rare for those individuals to get punished because even when romeo and juliet laws aren't on the books, the majority of people don't want to enforce them and the majority of states don't enforce them because neither of those fifteen year olds is pushing for enforcement. Whereas when it comes to like someone who's actually being taken advantage of in these situations it's a lot easier with age of consent laws being higher because then instead of having to go through the whole like intimate partner violence or sexual harassment suits all you or sexual assault suits you just have to say look this person is older than me I am below the age of consent which streamlines that entire process and it helps to protect the individuals who are caught in those situations. We would also say that the difference between a sixteen and a seventeen or even an eighteen year old is really significant. Like it might be arbitrary and that it's like people can be more mature at times but on average we'd say that generally eighteen is significantly higher maturity age, especially since at that point you're becoming an adult in a lot of other ways like you're graduating high school all of these things are changing in your life that a sixteen year old hasn't even come close to dealing with. So we think that this is actually a meaningful difference in terms of age as well. With that, two main arguments, first on protecting minors. People under seventeen are definitely a different level of maturity than those above. They have less experience to contextualize the world and are just beginning to go through a lot of the physical changes or like midway through them that would allow them to have sex in the first place. And even if some kids of that age are mature enough, we'd say the majority aren't. James keeps talking about how these kids are having consensual sex but we think the problem is that he's going to be making it a lot more difficult for those who aren't having consensual sex to report it. Since on his side of the house they'll have to go through the whole criminal investigation into whether it was actually rape while on ours the agent itself is enough to protect the kids and make it statutory and justify things like restraining orders, so it keeps them from having to go through that process. Like recognize it's really rare that two kids are sexting or having sex and they're sent to jail because they're the same age, like no one cares enough to report them at that point and when someone does it's usually because there's something bad going on that we just don't see yet. So we think it's actually really good to have this kind of extra check. Our second argument is about preventing predatory behavior. We want people who are older to try not to to who are older to not try and take advantage of kids. Like sixteen year olds are just like middle schoolers or freshman in high school or like at maximum right they're sophomores. And it's good that you prevent seniors or juniors from hitting on them could also that you prevent people who may be just entered college. You don't want to contribute to the sexualization of young bodies, lowering the age of consent allows people to think sexually about others at a very young age and this forces people into sex when they're unlikely to be ready just because the rest of society has already labeled them as such. Proud to oppose.
We should not abolish foster care. In this round, the government side has tried to paint foster care as a system in which people are entirely in it for profit, in which people simply want to get a financial benefit of taking these children into their homes, but the reality is much more complicated than that. While we certainly wouldn't deny that there are abuses in the foster home system, there are also massive abuses that exist within orphanages. And given that this is the case and that many foster parents do want to take care of their children, that they aren't in this for a financial incentive, which we'll talk about a little more in a second, we think that the reality is that foster homes are oftentimes an effective tool for the government to use, especially in areas in which children have already been living in certain places for a long time, in which they have a tie to the community, rather than rounding them all up and putting them in orphanages. So, let's talk about what the government has presented to us. The first argument they make is that there are harmful incentives that lead to abuse, that a large percentage of foster children are victims of abuse, and that because people are paid to take in foster children, this creates pernicious incentives. But there's a couple of problems with that argument. The main problem with that argument is that these incentives are not greater than the cost of caring for a child. And now while it's true the foster parent can still try to to be as minimalistic in caring for that child as possible, the reality is there are major there are major harms that come from abuse, like legal violations that come with that abuse that can land you in serious trouble. And if that abuse that abuse becomes obvious to the point where you're not spending that incentive money on the child, if that child is emaciated, if they haven't been to the doctor an extended period of time, something that is relatively easy for a social worker to pick up on, then you lose that incentive and put yourself at legal risks. But even if you don't buy the arguments that I just made, recognize that orphanages have many of those same incentives, where they get funds from the government, but multiplied by a dramatic degree because of how many children they take in. And so if you buy that people that are taking in these children are are doing so only for financial incentives, we think the same is likely to happen in orphanages. And given that abuse happens in both sides, the real question is given that reform and investment is needed, which should we be investing more in and, because this argument is about total abolition, can we still have foster care to a certain degree, which we think is certainly the case. The second argument that they make is that this is a bad use of resources and that when you centralize children in group homes and orphanages, it becomes easier to redistribute resources and easier to monitor people. Two responses. The first is that this also creates higher infrastructure costs, which means that the government is ultimately expending more, whereas in foster homes, you can push that burden onto people that are willing to take in these children. A large percentage of foster parents are people that are relatively wealthy and feel the desire to give back. And because of that, we think that many of them are better equipped than a state that is oftentimes already struggling for resources to to start investing in these things. And on the point of it being easier to monitor, this may be true, but in a less centralized system, you have a situation which if abuse is found, fewer people are being abused in any one location, and there's more options to move people to other foster parents rather than if you have abuse that's rampant in an entire orphanage, moving children into a different situation becomes much more difficult, because there are more to move and because more have been harmed. We think that regardless of whether whether or not foster care is perfect, it's clear that there are certainly instances in which it is beneficial and that in a comparative sense with orphanages, there's no reason to abolish it. And for these reasons, we should not abolish foster care.
Don't privatize national parks. We agree with james. Governments tend to be inefficient operators. We don't care about this because the alternative is having an efficient business but no national park that is actually operating in the way that a national park should. IE no one's going to care a lot about accessibility or education and everybody's going to care a lot about the amount of profit it makes. The whole purpose of national parks in the first place is to preserve areas of nature from human development and provide a sphere for humans to interface with nature. If we show you that either of these are affected by the government we win the round because it means that privatization isn't worth forgoing the whole purpose of the park. With that, we have two main arguments: first on maintaining accessibility. The problem with private corporations is that their main goal will always be maximizing their profit margin. There's no higher order principle that governs their decision in the same way that the government does, which is actually the cool thing about the government owning things. They get to prioritize the good of citizens and the good of society. They can afford to sacrifice things like profitability in order to make sure that citizens are being provided for. And this becomes especially important with things like public parks. The reason they're public in the first place is because society and the government recognize the exposure and access to nature and natural spaces is important to individuals and their development. When public parks are privatized the first thing that happens is that entry fees get as expensive as possible. It also means that the surrounding areas get more expensive, so even if you do get the kinds of things like gas stations that james talks about, the parking lots also and those gas stations also have higher prices, which we think isn't a fair trade off for that exposure. Like the restaurants surrounding increase in price as well as the demographic of people visiting shifts to those that can afford the park rather than just anyone who is interested. James says they're going to advertise more but we just don't think this matters because there's actually plenty of advertisement in the status quo. Like parks come up on lists of areas of attractions or registries online, like there's plenty of access to information about them. And if that advertisement trades off with gentrification of parks we don't think it's worth it. Our second argument is about nature. Like at the point that we think there's often going to be trade off between offering, like wanting more advertisement and what you have to give up to businesses in order to get that, we think it's okay to prioritize protecting nature above that as well. Because basically what james says is like: " look, you're going to have all these private businesses who are interested in you. You're gonna have more advertising potential. " But we think that what happens then is that these things are often going to have trade offs. Like in order to get business funding for the park from outside investors they have to offer them something in exchange. So this'll look like rights to spaces within the park or control over areas around the park. And we think the fact that you're now going to have like burger king built in the middle of these natural areas, or you're going to have a lot more like mining or like like industrial kind of development which is bad for those areas and toxic for those areas just isn't worth it. Like sure, we we think that like this might be something that has the exact impacts that james says it will but because those impacts will come with added pollution and the requirement to destroy nature, we don't think they are worth it. At the end of the day the government might not be a perfect actor but privatization is likely to be even worse because it government control over the conditions of these parks into the long term, which means you're going to have a world in which eventually it's just unprofitable to have these parks at all and you're just not going to have them. Proud to oppose.
We should not end mandatory retirement. In this round, we're going to respond to the arguments made by the government about why mandatory retirement should be ended and explain why we think it is utile for society to have mandatory retirement and why that's the most important thing. The first argument that they make is that mandatory retirement is simply age-based discrimination and that because bad workers are likely to get removed anyway and that age is not inherent to the quality of the work you're doing, that there are checks in the status quo to ensure that if age is an issue, it is addressed for other reasons. So three responses to this. The first is that there's a major difference between someone being a bad worker and someone lacking in the capacity to do jobs as well as others. You can be a perfectly productive person, but maybe you don't have the experience and the knowledge about the current technological climate or the current cultural climate that allows you to bring unique ideas and perspectives to the table, that allows you to push forward. There's a difference between being sufficient at your job and excelling at your job, and we think that because of the lack of continual training throughout someone's career, it's more likely than not that older people in the workforce are likely to be sufficient but not excelling. And so we think removing people because other quality candidates exist is totally reasonable. So the second response is that while age may be arbitrary, we think there's clear delineations at which point someone should be expected to be able to retire. Having been in the workforce for forty, fifty years means that you should have had enough time to plan for retirement, to be prepared for this retirement period, whereas other people, younger people in the workforce, have had no ability to get the sort of savings, they'd had no ability to get the sort of upward mobile jobs within companies, and so we think you need to clear the room for them. The third reason the third response is that there's a lot of reasons why someone who even is bad at their job may not get removed, especially if you're talking about someone with a significant amount of seniority. These are often people that are in managerial positions. These are people in positions of power. The people that often have the ability to remove others are the ones that we're talking about in this round. And so, whether it's because of a power imbalance, of fear of removal because of things like lawsuits, we think there's many reasons why people do not get removed when they should be, and so we think that it's important to have some sort of plan in place to remove those people. They say this is unjust paternalism based on age, but generally we're more concerned with the utile outcome for society and the utility of recycling the work force and getting new people into jobs. And we think that protections allow for benefits upon dismissal. So even if people don't have a ton of money to retire, there's often protections, especially in the united states, like social security, that allow for these people to have a quality of life that is decent and allows them to use whatever savings they've had. That's their next argument, that people just may not have the ability to retire. They may not have the money. But we think that the tradeoff with the tradeoff is that young people can't access jobs and aren't able to start providing for themselves in a way that allows them to be productive in society. And their second argument is largely in response to this, that young people don't deserve the jobs more than older people and that young people have other options. But two responses to these things. The first is that it's not a question of whether young people deserve these jobs, it's a question of utility. It's the fact that they bring new ideas, new cultural experience, technological advancement to the table in a way that, as we mentioned earlier, allows businesses to excel in productivity, to increase. And we think that a large problem while young people may have other options as far as entry level positions, these older people largely clog up the hierarchy within the workforce, which means that they have less chance at upward mobility and less opportunity to really start building a foundation for themselves financially. Finally, they say that decreasing dependence on the state through people working means that you have less harm to social security. So, social security isn't dependent on unemployment, and so we don't think this argument actually stands. For these reasons, we should not end mandatory retirement.
We should not introduce year-round schooling. So the way that the government has modeled this is essentially that they would break up summer vacation, maybe take off some of the length of summer vacation and instead have multi-weeklong breaks at different points during the school year potentially between quarters but these long breaks during the school year. So the first argument the government makes is that this system is better for students and that the main reason for this is that over the course of an entire summer people are going to forget material which means you're wasting time going over the same stuff at the beginning of this the beginning of the year that people did at the end of last year and it's just an inefficient way of learning. But recognize that because of the model that we are presented with that you're still going to have long breaks at multiple points during the school year. Now you're just saying now you're just increasing the amount of times during the year where you have to go through and review materials. Like if you're trying to learn a new skill or something new, and anyone can vouch for this, if you take two to three weeks off from doing something like for example, I'm trying to learn how to code right now but I just spent the last week not coding. I'm going to have to go through and review what I just learned because that's a week away from what I did. The things that are most recent my memory have faded away and it doesn't take three months for this to happen. It can happen over the course of a couple of weeks. So we think that you're just increasing those amounts of wasted review times and we think we'd rather have it so that it's just structured at the beginning of the school year. They say people will be less stressed and more productive because they have more time off throughout the year but we think you're still likely going to have the same amount of work. You're just spreading out when the stress is going to occur and so we don't think that this is a meaningful tipping point in terms of how students are feeling. The final argument they make under this is that this provides preparation for the real world because the real world doesn't have summer vacations but I really genuinely believe that there's value in letting kids be kids and letting kids enjoy the enjoy the freedom that they have, enjoy the fact that they aren't that they aren't responsible for their own well being, that they have developmental time socially, that they are allowed to experience childhood and taking away summer vacation we think has a meaningful harm on that and we think that in the status quo people are able to have kind of a a more fulfilling childhood than they would on the government side of the house. The second argument they make is that their side of the house maximizes the school system. First, they point to the united states because that's where this is set and say we are doing poorly globally compared to other countries as far as test scores, understanding in math and literacy, etcetera. But we think that this isn't just against countries that have year-round schooling like japan. It's also against countries that don't have year-round schooling like most of europe. The the issue with the US school system and with our test scores is not just that we have a school schedule the way we do, but it's also the way that we're teaching is regressive, it's not catching up with new standards and new understandings and this is the harm that we are causing. We think that there are way bigger measures that need to be taken to improve our education system than just breaking up summer vacation and having other breaks during the year. They say again they talk about wasted review time but again see the argument we already made that we think this is actually worse on their side of the house and finally they say that it's a better use of resources, that you're buildings stay empty during the summer. We think that this is actually probably good as far as it means there's less money that needs to be spent like for example in the united states most of the country during the summer is really hot which means that you have to spend a lot of resources in air conditioning and other sorts of upkeep for the school in order for it to be used during the summer on the government side of the house which increases taxes, increases costs of education, and ultimately we think creates a worse environment for students to learn in. For all these reasons, we should not introduce year-around schooling.
Two reasons urbanization does far more good than harm. One on public goods, and two on natural preservation. Before that, three points of extraneous rebuttal. One, james talks to you about familial network breakdown. Two responses to this. A, note this is transitional at best, which means at the point at which one person moved to the city that harms that person's family. However, that person starts a new family in the city, as do many around him, and those people are no longer affected, which means it's a very short term issue. B, we think james is confusing cause and effect. The familial network is not based on tit for tat, it's based on massive love from one person in the family to the other people in the family. This means oftentimes, the mother works so hard to care for her child, not because she expects him to care for her back but because she wants to grant him the opportunities that she's never had to move to the big city and to enjoy a better life than she managed to enjoy. If that is the case, we think it doesn't break down the familiar network, it continues it. You continue to come home for christmas and thanksgiving, you consider to call your mother every day at the end of the day. We think that it's a continuation of the network. Two, he says traditional culture becomes abandoned. A, we simply call BS on that, right? Lots of people move to cities and maintain their original cultures. That's why large cities are often so multicultural. But b, and this is the crucial part, note today each individual in that town is captured in their own culture. They have no other alternative. In urbana areas you get to choose your culture. So you don't adopt no culture, or you can adopt no culture and you can adopt western culture, you can also opt in to other cultures that aren't your own. We expand the birth lottery and allow culture to be an opt in situation. We think that's a far better situation. Three, lastly, he says " look, this debate is about megacities and slums like marrakesh, and those places are clearly awful ". Two responses. A, this debate is far from limited to those areas. Urbanization is an issue of expansion. It is true that in poorer countries that expansion tends to focus on one specific city. Note the cause for this is not too much urbanization, it's not enough of the city's urbanizing, because if they could spread out their urbanization across three, four, five large cities, then we'd have wonderful effects from this. So even with this rationale of slums being bad, that stems from not enough urbanization, not too much of it. Two, note that even if this debate were only about those slums, it's temporary. As more people urbanize, the outer rings become inner rings, and then start to enjoy some of the benefits that cities have. What are those benefits? Let's talk about public goods. We say one of the greatest things you get from urbanization is consolidation of resources. This is analogous, for example, to the way that walmart is able to offer you produce at much cheaper rates than anywhere else. Why? Because walmart is so so big that they buy in bulk. Cities are able to do the same. They offer you public transportation in bulk. They offer you education in bulk. They offer you housing in bulk. All of these things mean they're able to give you more for less. That means a, that people are able to enjoy a higher standard of living even if they have substantially less money, and b, that the resources that they're using are fewer as a whole. What does that mean? Two, natural preservation. The alternative to urbanization is spreading out farther. That means that next to each town where you have a nice natural reservation, you overturn that natural reservation and build a town instead. Why? Because you need to move somewhere because you're expanding as a population, and you're no longer supporting urbanization, which means expanding of expansion of current areas of living. That means destroying nature as it exist. We think it is far better for humankind and for the nature, for nature itself, to expand in existing areas and maintain natural preservation as opposed to running over the entire natural resource. For these reasons, proud to oppose.
Ladies and gentleman, the government in this debate has some serious phobias of freedoms. They are violating both the freedom of choice of every individual who chooses to go into a casino or not, and they're violating the freedoms of the marketplace that keeps the market alive and well and stable. Let's talk about three main points. We're gonna talk first about addiction, because we think that this is a major point in today's debate. We're gonna move on to talk about the local economies and how we're actually empowering local economies, making them better, and we're gonna talk briefly about the value of gambling. But let's start with addiction, as we said. Addiction is obviously an extremely serious problem. The problem is that banning one possible addiction or another is not going to solve the problem. There are people who are simply prone to addiction, and these are the people that get addicted to gambling, to drugs, to alcohol, and more often than not, more than one of those things or other things. So, often, you see people who are addicted to gambling are also addicted to alcohol, for example. We don't think that banning gambling is is casinos is going to make any difference whatsoever. In fact, we do think there's going be a difference, but it's going to be worse than before, but why? Why is it not going to help? One, because you're often going to turn to other addictions and make those, the addictions that you already have, worse. And second of all, you are going to turn to the black market, as opposed to what the government tried to tell us as where this is a specific case where the black market won't work. Actually, we think that gambling is one of the better quote unquote addictions to have, because it's actually harder to ignore. So when you lose thousands of dollars in one night, yes, it is harmful, but you're more likely to get help than somebody who drinks a bottle of scotch in secret every night. It is harder to hide it's harder to hide the gambling, and it is harder to ignore the gambling for the people around you, because there's such a concrete harm to the family, as opposed to things like drinking that can be hidden much better, unfortunately. And also, the black market is absolutely nothing to sneeze at. You don't need casinos. We're not talking about underground casinos that are that are hiding from the authorities. All you're talking about are high stakes poker games, high stakes roulette games, etcetera, which are very easy to conduct in in a multitude of places, in a back room at a bar, whatever it is. They're very easy to find, and they are far more dangerous than any casino could ever be. Why? Because everyone in the room wants your money, everyone in the room is drinking, everyone in the room is at the edge of their seat, and everyone in the room is encouraging everyone else to bid more and more and more money, and these are always high stakes games. There's nothing like putting down pennies or dimes or dollars at these tables. You're talking only thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars. There's often violence when things go even moderately wrong in these rooms. So you can we we we don't necessarily object to modifying certain casino regulations to limit how much people can play or how much money we you can spend in a night, etcetera, but abolishing the industry as a whole is more dangerous than having casinos open. Second of all, we think that casinos are wonderful moneymakers. One, we have no problem with people who are rich getting richer, right? They're providing entertainment for the masses, and most people when they go lose a little bit of money, but they enjoy it so much that it was worth it. It is absolutely no different from somebody dropping eight hundred dollars to see hamilton on broadway. In fact, it might be more worthwhile. Second of all, of course the local economy gains, right? Taxes from the casinos are poured back into local services and second of all, local businesses, they might have to innovate, but they can collaborate with the casinos to offer goods and services. And furthermore, these tend to be places where no one used to visit before the casinos came. So it's not as though it was better without the casinos. Gambling has value, ladies and gentlemen, it's an entertainment value. You are losing you're not losing money, you are spending money to have fun, and that's not something we can we can ignore. The industry is great for local economies, and while addiction is a terrible disease, closing casinos is not going to stop addicts. Thank you very much.
We should not end progressive taxation. In this round we're going to respond to the arguments made by the government side and explain why we think that ultimately progressive taxation is the most fair form of any form of tax whether it be sales tax, wealth tax and income tax what have you. So the first argument the government side makes is that progressive taxation is unfair and arbitrary and that the wealthy benefit the same from the government. This is just empirically not the case. If the government is responsible for providing services in addition to providing things like infrastructure, facilitating a fair and safe market in order for people to do business in, facilitating the livelihoods of people, it is clear that the value that is gained from those services from infrastructure that allows for trade to happen, from markets that allow for business to be done, from protection of property. Those that have accumulated the most well have clearly benefited disproportionately from these government benefits. They give the example of roads and everyone drives on those roads yet but not everyone has a fleet of trucks to run their shipping business that those roads require in clearly they are benefiting more from that infrastructure than the poor. So we think that because the benefits are accumulating greater to the wealthy from government services, that the wealthy should pay a higher tax. They say secondly, that the state shouldn't determine the marginal value of a dollar. It's not the state that's determining the marginal value of a dollar, it's the market. If you have a million dollars verse have a thousand dollars, your rent is still going to be the same. The ability the cost of housing to you in a flat system is still going to be the same and so the value of your dollar does not go as far if you have less dollars to spend. Lastly under this they say that the brackets in progressive taxation are are arbitrary. This is an argument for reforming the system as it exists in the status quo not for abolishing the system and the reason that we shouldn't abolish it is, as we've explained already, the impacts of progressive taxation are greater or the impacts of the government work is greater for those that are wealthy and therefore the wealthy should pay more. But we also think there are just straight utilitarian benefits that come from progressive taxation and this is our response to their second argument that this is a needlessly complicates tax codes and that it promotes tax evasion. We think that even if it's true that this does that this complicates tax codes one, we don't think that it's necessarily the case that you can't have progressive taxation and a simplified tax code. Two, we think that this is dramatically outweighed by the redistribution of wealth that occurs with a progressive tax system that allows for those at the bottom, who are usually at the bottom through no fault of their own, to accumulate some sort of value and to get the benefits that the economy is producing that we see clearly now are not being distributed evenly across the workforce and we think it simply is more fair for the reasons we've already explained. On tax evasion, we think people will do this anyway. They gave no clear reason for why a flat tax system wouldn't have the same benefits of tax evasion as the status quo. Finally, they talk about how progressive taxation ignores inability to pay. First, you can have a wealth tax that is also progressive. This argument is about the principal of progressive taxation itself not just income tax but secondly, this acknowledgment that the ability to pay is important in some way contradicts the entire government advocacy. We think that by acknowledging that there is unfairness in taxing people the same because of their inability to pay, that they show that progressive taxation is the most fair system for all people. Also even if it does even if it doesn't account if we're only talking about income tax, you can still have tax deductions for debt. This is not a round winning argument. For these reasons, we should not end progressive taxation.
There are three major things we think we get from personality tests within the realm of hiring. One is efficacy. Within this it's crucial to understand that nobody is being forced to use these tests, but rather we assume rationality on the part of the employers. We assume this rationality both in using the test in the first place and in implementation of the results of the test. This means that when james tells you that you'll get only one type of person, we say one of two things as possible: a, you are better off with only one type of person and so choose to only get one type of person in your work environment. B, you are aware that diversity in the type of people in your working environment is necessary in order to advance your business, in which case as a rational business owner you will make sure to choose to diversify. Both of these options, some preferable in certain businesses others preferable and others, are only available to you when you have more information as to the candidates. Now they say this test is imperfect and they're right. However, note that the comparative is not with perfect information but rather lack of information altogether. They say well look, compare it to other hiring practices such as recommendations. Note that information is available today. The only difference is a lack of the information of the personal of the personality test. So we think it is very beneficial to business owners in certain areas and to be able to do this. Secondly, we think they have the right to do this. A privately owned business is similar to a privately owned home of an individual. It belongs to me and I have the right to ensure that I'm surrounded by people with whom I can cooperate and who make my day bearable and not worse. What does this mean? It means much like I can choose to only befriend entertaining people and only invite those people to a party I'm hosting at my house, I can also choose that there are only certain types of personality which I want to take part in my privately owned business. This is particularly true when you note the effect of personality on a person's ability to do their job, which differentiates it from gender for example. It is discrimination only when it is not relevant and pertinent to the notion of ability to commit your job. However, when it is, when it's similar to the necessity for a nurse to show empathy or a teacher to show patience or a lawyer in certain fields to show aggression, we think these are things that are pertinent to the job and therefore not discriminatory in any meaningful sense of the word. Lastly, we think these tests help minority groups. How? They enable them an avenue to avert stereotyping. What does that mean? It means within the realm of people who would likely have stereotyped against them and not hired them under assumptions of particular personalities because of the color of their skin or their gender, it enables them to step out of that box and prove that they are not such, they do that they do not fall under the stereotype for their race or gender, therefore making it easier to advance minority groups within society. What then are our responses to what we hear from james? One, he says it's unfair to test takers. A, information not being permitted to ask. We say that's debatable whether we shouldn't be able to ask that but at worst remove those questions. He says it doesn't necessarily affect performance, we say it often does. B, grades and education often don't affect performance. However, you're working with a non-perfect data set. This improves upon it even if it does so in in in an imperfect way. He says the test doesn't account for stress during the interview. We say we find that likely that that was factored in at some point, particularly given that is in the interest of the free market to factor that in. He says it is harmful to employers, we say that is up to them to as rational actors to decide, not to him. So because it's not discrimination, it is not harmful, it is beneficial, it is in the right of the employer to do this, and it helps minority groups, please oppose the motion.
In this debate, we strongly oppose recall votes, because we think the notion of a consistent never-ending election determined by referendum, if the most counterproductive way you can possibly run a government. One point of counterfactual framing. Proposition seems to, seem to be arguing this debate in a vacuum. As if it's either recall vote, or no way of control. We say there are two such ways of control. One, regular elections, but more importantly, there do exist mechanisms in which a government can be overthrown by political parties and the supreme court, things like impeachment in the united states, things like, votes of distrust in the UK. Crucially, the difference is, these mechanisms are controlled by other parties in government, parties who both have the interest in taking down other parties when those aren't doing their jobs, but also a continuous interest in doing their jobs properly in order to represent their constituencies. This will lead us into why we think an ever-involved citizen is a terrible idea for democracy. Before that, two points of extraneous rebuttal. First, they say on prop, look these people aren't doing their jobs. Why, short term memory leads to, a constituency that doesn't remember the platform and therefore they're not held accountable. We don't think that's how people work. See, what happens is you don't remember the platform perhaps, but you do remember your situation five years ago, and you compare it to your situation today. If you feel you're better off than you were then, that you vote to reelect. If you feel you are worse off, than you vote to replace. The minutia of bills that were passed and votes that were voted on shouldn't, and don't, affect whether or not you revote but rather, how your situation has changed. We think that's excellent. Secondly, they say political engagement will go substantially up. We think they mis-characterize what it is that most people want. Most people don't want to be politically engaged twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, etcetera etcetera. Most people want to elect someone then just trust that someone to do what it is that they're being hired to do. Why, most people don't have the ability to follow politics that closely all of the time. By making an ever-existant elections you're essentially leaving politics to those rich people who can afford to spend half their time on the internet googling the latest news of politicians. We think that's wrong. As it is, people have a difficulty keeping up with all the politics, on your side of the house you just make it worse. When they say, look, now politicians will spend more time with their constituencies, how do either of them have time for that if you want the politician to be working on passing bills properly, and the people to be starting out an economy on the outside. Let's talk about why elections are terrible. Election times are infamous for waste. They're a waste of money because people spend their time campaigning, they're are a waste of resources because people spend their time their efforts going state to state talking to people, convincing people, setting up platforms, and crucially, they mean, you're not doing any actual parliamentary work during this time. It's well known that laws don't happen and things don't happen the year before a new election. We think by making it constant elections, you ensure that no politician ever has time to actually do their job because they're constantly busy trying to convince people that they're nonetheless doing their job. Why is it so crucial when it's based on citizens, unlike governing parties those are subject to whims. It means it only takes one crazy person with a bunch of followers on twitter in order to restart an entire campaign election. Governments show restraint, individuals do not do so. This means that if you want to make a better world tomorrow and not just have accountability for it but actually do it, you need to leave the politicians breathing room in order to do their jobs, please oppose.
Don't privatize postal services. Tim rails on and on about how postal services are a waste of government money, but doesn't actually prove that it's a bad thing that this is where money goes. Sure there are other private companies that have taken over a lot of shipping, but those private companies aren't comprehensive insofar as we continue to use the USPS. Recognize that the difference between these private companies and USPS is that these private companies have no obligation to provide to the areas in which they don't make a profit off of those provisions. Whereas USPS will provide the same rates regardless of the region and will make sure to service those regions regardless of how hard they are to reach. And this is actually really important as we'll tell you in our first independent point, but also is just a reason for why as even if there are a million private companies who take over ninety percent of these kinds of markets, we still think it's important to keep the USPS to take care of those other ten percent that aren't getting access. We can have things that make mail more efficient like thinning out postal offices in low population density or letter dense areas, but the answer isn't privatizing it entirely, just making things more spotty or looking at places where the usage is really low and like maybe making sure that you're not having as large of a postal center there. Three main arguments, first on maintaining egalitarian service. The government can't just decide that it won't deliver mail to specific areas or that certain groups of people won't provide them with enough profit the way that private corporations can. Because if the government did that there would be massive backlash about it not fulfilling its roles and obligations. Corporations have no such obligation to the american people as a whole, only to profit and their shareholders. This means that if it is unprofitable to deliver mail to a certain area or a certain population, they simply won't do it. Rural areas are likely to carry the brunt of this which is really bad because they also happen to be areas that use the postal service most because the other private company options are often lacking and because the type of people who live there tend to be people who might be more of a fan of snail mail like older people or people who are less technologically savvy. Delivering mail shouldn't be about turning a profit. It's a valuable public service that allows the billions of people within a country to maintain connection with each other and to receive items they need from each other. The postal service delivers forty percent of the world's cards and letters, so even though snail mail is less common now, it's still an important part of many people's lives. And even if tim personally doesn't use snail mail to communicate, it's very clear that plenty of people do. Our second argument is that it is expensive to switch. In order to even start the privatization process, the US would have to make the postal service appear to be competitive and have profitability potential. This would require a lot of capital investment from the government to do so, which we think is a waste of money at the point that you're only fluffing it up in order to sell it away. It would also require a deregulation of the postal service which should be opposed by most parties and contribute to congressional gridlock as well. Our third argument is about jobs. We think that backlash against the loss of postal service funding is generally a good thing, even though tim seems to disagree. It means that we are valuing the contribution to the economy even if it is a little bit artificial. Government provides good benefits and a living wage to thousands of employees. Where you were you to privatize the system, it would result in tons of jobs lost and likely lower wages and we think that it's actually a good thing to continue to pour some tax money into this if it means you're providing livable wage, providing good benefits to so many employees who are working for the government in this capacity. Proud to oppose.
We should not ban anonymous posting online. Contrary to what tim tells you we are going to argue first for a right to privacy and second for the effect that this would have in autocratic countries that limit people's freedom of expression. So first: what is this right to privacy and why is it so important? We think that one of the most novel things about the internet is that it lets people communicate in large communities completely anonymously. People have come to expect that they'll have privacy online and be able to express their opinions without being held to the same standards of accountability that they would have speaking in a literal public square. It's true that this kind of privacy didn't exist a hundred years ago or two hundred years ago but that doesn't mean it isn't valuable, especially to people who have grown up with the expectation of this right to privacy. We think that as technology has improved and a society's expectations have changed that there is now a public conception that people should have some ability to express themselves anonymously and to be able to exchange ideas anonymously. This is as I'll explain in just a minute been very important to political changes around the world including the arab spring which probably couldn't have happened if people hadn't been able to anonymously discuss their dissatisfaction with their governments. So we think that because rights come from convention, that is to say rights exist because people believe in them and in as much as many people millions of people believe in this right to online privacy, that it would be a violation of that right and therefore an injustice to take away peoples' ability to post online. Tim says that it's important to check free speech when it contrasts with the ability to have a stable and orderly government, but I don't think that's necessarily true. We'll talk more about this in just a moment but I think that it's important to note that there aren't checks on people's freedom of speech other than actual calls for violence in many liberal countries and that we need to extend those principles of freedom of speech in a public square or in a coffee shop to make it a little more concrete to a discussion on an online forum. After all freedom of speech doesn't exist in order to protect a certain forum. The founding fathers in the US didn't say that people were free to express themselves in a marketplace and not in an ale house or something like that. Rather it's a principle thing that people should be able to express themselves freely and that's what we want to protect. Our second argument is about the effect that this would have in authoritarian countries. If you imagine a country like say syria prior to the syrian civil war, people generally speaking weren't free to express themselves in the public square because assad's regime would crackdown on anyone who wanted to resist the baathist party. The internet really brought in the ability for people in countries like that to discuss politics openly and genuinely with people outside of their family and friends and allowed people to organize the protest that would later become the arab spring in tunisia and then across the arab world. We think that if you took away anonymous posting, people wouldn't discuss politics online because of the risk of a crackdown and therefore that it would be impossible for people to express their preferences against dictatorial regimes. We think that similarly in countries like iran or turkey that are quasidemocratic, this has been very important to organizing massive protests. The huge protest we saw in iran a few years ago after the rigged elections would not have been possible without anonymous online posting to get information out to people. So I think that if you ban anonymous posting, that places a huge check on democratic forces and more importantly on the will of those people directly in countries where you can't freely express yourself in the public square. For all of these reasons we should not ban anonymous posting online. Thank you.
Government is trying to convince us that ADHD is an ailment just like the flu, and that it needs to be taken care of by using a medicine, and that ritalin and adderall is the equivalent of aspirin or antibiotics, or even a cast that you put on a broken arm. We totally disagree with that diagnosis. We believe that there are several key differences. A, it is not so much a passing temporary ailment, but rather a condition that is permanent. B, ritalin and adderall has have been proven to be physically psychoactive. People without ADHD use them as well as a form of recreational drugs because they provide a feeling of euphoria. This leads me to c, unlike aspirin or antibiotics or, you know, casts, ritalin and adderall are highly addictive and with a huge potential to make abusers out of users. Children that start that start out by taking, like, just a pill in order to remain focused in class, many times end up completely dependent on it to do even the most simplest of tasks that they shouldn't have any problem doing, and that they could have done without using ritalin or adderall prior to their like before they started taking it. Lastly and most crucially, we do not believe that ADHD is necessarily something that we need to look at as some sort of a setback, but rather a different form of thinking. We think that while it is like it is true that it makes certain tasks more difficult, certain tasks that require like long term concentration, there are also a lot of advantages and pluses that come with ADHD, like a tendency to think creatively outside the box, for instance. In this sense it is not unlike people with asperger syndrome. In this generation in which it is becoming less and less abnormal and more and more children are being diagnosed with this condition, it is time that we stop seeing this as an ailment, and that that we need to ask how to how we cope with it, and start asking ourselves how do we make our schools and our education system and our society as a whole more accessible and more relevant to those people. Perhaps we need to rethink the old models of, like, long frontal lectures and standardized testings. Note how this clashes directly with all of the analysis of side government on how ADHD doesn't allow children to succeed in their education, and I think that basically all of their harms that they point to derives from. Specifically they mention the feeling of depression that's, like, results from the fact that these children experience like experience a lack of success, and how they feel that they're not as smart or not as good as other children. We agree that this thing is crucial in terms of making the lives of people that, like, with ADHD better and and allowing them to contribute back to society more in the future, but we don't think that the problem can be really solved by ritalin. We think that even in the best case scenario for side government, if if ritalin truly helped a child sit through the test and get a good grade, he still he still feels that something is wrong with him so that he requires some sort of, like, extra medicine. He's still not like the other kids that don't need no assistance, he is still insecure and afraid to go out to the world and compete for his place against people that he perceives to have a competitive advantage on him. The only way to solve this is through an institutional change in the way that we rate children today in schools, meaning based on their ability to sit quietly for several hours. As long as we continue on providing these temporary solutions, like ritalin or adderall, that provide a quick temporary fix, we will continue to get children with this inferiority complex that find it difficult to fit in in society, and all of the harms that james does such a beautiful work in explaining what they are. So, please oppose.
Right from the start, I'd like to say that the previous speaker has left many crucial details out of his definition or his mechanism to this debate. First, it's unclear whether the intention is to recall a president or a member of congress, maybe like both, we think that these are pretty important details. Next, it's unclear if like the the moment that a certain candidate is being recalled, does this mean that now his seat is open to members of both parties, or does that mean that we can only choose a replacement of the same party? Again, these are pretty important details. But perhaps most importantly, it's unclear from the mechanism when exactly, I mean what are the required necessary conditions that that need to be met for there to be a recall vote? And I'm not just insisting on technical things, this is really important. The only thing that we've heard from side government is that this happens when the public is not satisfied from the elected candidate or when campaign promises aren't being fulfilled. Well, newsflash: basically, at any given moment, there are huge, huge chunks of the public that aren't going to be satisfied, and most campaign promises usually don't get fulfilled, because that's what campaign promises are like. They're not really meant to actually happen, they're meant to get you the most votes. So what we say is, basically, that from what side government did say, this sounds as if like any day or two, there could be a recall vote. Add to this the fact that now all of the actions of the losing side, the the party that lost the elections, are going to be aimed at like acquiring impeachment through a recall election. And this means that the election season is just never over, and this has devastating effects on the country. So we're being told that direct democracy is a good thing, because elections are the most direct way of for the citizen to influence the policies and the more the merrier, right? So, we say that there's a reason that we have a method of a representative democracy and not a direct model, and this reason is that otherwise, it would just be impossible to get anything done. True, this means less direct influence, but seriously arguing that we ought have a direct democracy today with hundreds of millions of citizens is just silly. We really don't understand this argument. Then we're being told that that if campaign promises have not been fulfilled, then there's a principle justification for the citizen to change his mind, and we think that this could have been a valid point were it not so naive. I mean, obviously, campaign promises are being broken all the time. This almost doesn't matter who wins the elections because during the campaign, the candidate is mainly busy with trying to win over votes. Therefore, he must exaggerate his opinions and make promises as if there is no tomorrow. But as soon as you're in office, you realize that things aren't so easy, point being this principle point of side government sounds good on paper but in reality, if we would like to say that every politician that has broke that that broke his campaign promises needs to be replaced, we would have been left without politics at all. And finally, we hear a point on how politicians are corrupt and they don't have the people's interests at heart and so on, and we say that that's probably true. There are inherent problems in democracy but at the very least, we have an opportunity to change our our like our elected officials once every four years. So, and like, if it's if a certain politician has been exposed to doing something really, really corrupt, like during these four years, then in the middle of his term, then usually he will be impeached anyway or he'll resign on his own, case in point: nixon, after the watergate scandal. So, eventually we say that the potential damage is is somewhat limited, but if no politician can feel safe enough to to plan ahead for more than a week ahead, because whoever knows if he won't get recalled by then, this is much worse for everybody. Please oppose.
I stand in firm opposition to the motion casinos should be banned. What my opponent really misses in this debate is that there are a lot of problematic things in our society but going around trying to ban every single one actually does far more harm than good. Besides the inherent moral harms, we think that there are a variety of economic and social harms that come as a result of individuals trying to regulate every tiny part of the economy particularly the morals of our society. With that in mind, I have two arguments but first some brief rebuttal. My opponent only makes one argument in this entire debate. It stems around morals, it stems around the idea that casinos are simply unfair. He says that gambling is rigged. Two main responses: one, it's really just not. We think that things like slot machines do have a predetermined number of winners per hour, predetermined number of winners per day but there's still a certain amount of randomness that comes from the slot machine. We think that every single pull could potentially be a winner. Sure, if you sit there and spend every single dollar that you have, you're likely to lose money and you're unlikely to get a huge payout. This is by design. We don't think this is problematic. This leads me to my second main response. Every single kind of gambling is rigged or unfair by my opponent's definition. Things like craps, things like blackjack, poker are random you don't know what the card's going to be. The house does not stack the deck. It's just when you might win say a ratio of three halves to what you paid in and the house wins double what they paid in, or at least all that you essentially put in in the first place, we think that the general result is that they will make more money in the long term but this is true of literally every kind of gambling. My opponent himself says that he will not ban every single type of gambling so he accepts that in many cases it's just. Now if you have, for instance, a basketball game where there's a fifty fifty percent chance of either team winning, we don't think that the broker is going to give you one to one odds as I say he's not going to make it so every dollar you pay in is a dollar out which would ultimately be the fair thing for that sort of game. No instead you're likely to get what you paid in plus maybe eighty percent as on top of that. This means that no matter what happens, the broker makes money. This is true in literally any kind of gambling. We think that this is the result of the fact that brokers need to make money. They're not just gamblers like everybody else and as such, we think that gambling really isn't rigged or at the very least it's not more rigged than other forms of gambling which my opponent is apparently okay with. My first argument then is that of freedom. We think that individuals should have the right first to spend money how they see fit. This includes individuals who are building businesses and includes individuals who are trying to entertain themselves. For a lot of people we think that gambling is a major way in which they can get entertainment, they can be happy, they can have some fun. Sure, gambling problems exist but alcoholism exists, smoking addiction insists. This isn't a reason to ban them. Each outright as such, we think that this freedom is incredibly important to actually allow individuals to self-actualize and prevent tyranny on behalf of government. My second argument is just practicality. Think back to the example I gave about alcohol and cigarettes. Every time we've tried to outright ban a particular item it goes underground. Sure we don't ban things like like betting on sports games but we think that other more pernicious forms of gambling will likely take the place of casinos. This includes things like cockfights. This includes things like dogfights. We think individuals will try to get their kicks however they see fit, however they can find gambling. This will introduce more illicit, illegal and problematic gambling into our society. For this reason, casinos should not be banned.
It's always interesting to hear speeches by governments, grandiose speeches about why a particular policy or a particular industry or field is harming poor people and therefore we should stop it. Okay. And then what? And then what happens to these unskilled workers who can't get a job? What happens to these unskilled workers who aren't going to be offered a long term contract, because they don't have a resume today? Because without temporary jobs, without anything on their resume, because when you don't give them any starting point, they're not gonna have any way to enter the field. They're not gonna have any way to impress a boss, even if they're only there for three months. They're not gonna have any kind of contract, they're not gonna have any money to plan for. Yes, it's difficult to plan for the week or to plan for the month when you're not always sure what hours you're gonna be working and how much when you're going to be bringing in, but at least you can rely on the fact that you're probably going to be bringing in some amounts of money. And in many situations, with the the type the people that we're talking about, the under uneducated people with low skills, these are exactly the kinds of people who can't always pick and choose. Who can't say: " well, you know, the temp agency isn't treating me well so I'm going to leave the job. " The fact is that if it was so terrible, if the temp agencies were worse than not having a job, then these people would leave. If there was any other option for them, then they would leave these temp agencies. But the government doesn't solve any problems. They simply create a worse situation for the unskilled workers they're they claim to be trying to help. You say it's a band aid solution to poverty, but what is your solution? These are not people who would get employment elsewhere. The long term contracts that you talk about, such as for seasonal workers, it can harm these people. You can't possibly advance when you're locked into a contract even though you're missing five months of the year, even though you're missing a lot more than that. It's ridiculous to think that that would be the case. What we're gonna talk about is the temporary workers who actually need the jobs and why it's important for them and for the industries have temporary positions available. The type of people who work at temporary agencies are people who either need flexible hours and join only on the condition of having those flexible hours, such a single parents for example, or students, people who can't get jobs otherwise, people who just have no skills that they can list on a resume, who have no education to speak of and absolutely have to make money in order to survive and in order to provide for their families, and the type of people who are trying to gain experience, trying to gain a foothold. Going into a place, and they're willing to take that opportunity and try and impress their boss, try and impress their supervisors at their job. And we think, ladies and gentlemen, the for these people it's extremely important that temporary work become available, is still available. We also think, ladies and gentlemen, that it's that there's huge harm to the companies that use these temp agencies. We think there's a reason that you would use a a temp as opposed to long term contract, for example when you're trying to fill in a position for somebody who's on maternity leave or somebody who's on sick leave, and you need somebody to fill the position, but you don't have the time to to recruit, to interview, to train, etcetera, somebody. So you pay somebody to quickly fill in the position. Sometimes you are impressed and sometimes it does lead to long term positions, but often this is simply a place where you really only need somebody temporary. Why should we stop the marketplace and ban an entire industry and an entire field when we could simply regulate it to make sure that abuses become much more minimal and and hopefully disappear altogether? You can make sure that there's a minimum wage in place, that they're being paid. You can make sure that they have certain benefits in place if they're working for for a temp agency over a long period of time. Why can we not fixed the problem instead of simply doing away with the entire system? It makes no sense. These are people who need to be employed, these are people whose only opportunity and only options to be employed is through this temp agencies. We should help them not hurt them.
Hunting should not be banned. Unsurprisingly in this round the government side has argued to you that this is cruel to animals and that this is harmful overall to those animals as a main point of their side. But we think that overall animals simply don't have rights and that as far as hunting is concerned, as far as the pain to animals, whether or not you like it viscerally does not mean that you're violating any sort of right or doing anything outside of the natural scope of those animals lives. So let's break that down. Why do we think that animals have no rights? Well firstly, we just don't think that natural rights exist. We don't think that there are rights that can be divined from the universe or from the ethereal world around us that have any sort of meaning because for rights to be meaningful they need to be enforced in some way which to us means that rights exist mostly and entirely within the human sphere. Rights are a construct that humans created for utilitarian purposes to protect humans, to designate certain things within society that are unacceptable and that must be protected and that within that sphere of existence, within our social spheres of existence, we have given those rights and those rights get power from the institutions that we live within. Well recognize animals exist entirely outside of that sphere. Animals are not a part of the construct that led to the creation of rights and therefore animals do not need to be included within that construct. Some may say that this creates a slippery slope argument where you don't value certain human life as much as others but we think that that is ridiculous. All human life exists within an inherently social sphere. All human life is part of the construct that we are creating and therefore we think that it is unlikely that humans will be excluded just because we exclude animals. Some may say this is arbitrary, but we think it is in fact quite clear that animals are just not a part of this society, they're not a part of our construct of rights. They say the government side that says this is inhumane and the last moments of these animals lives is painful and harsh but this is literally nature. Like think of like if you're hunting deer there are a couple of ways that that deer's life is going to end and most of them do not involve some sort of natural death. Maybe they'll get eaten by different predator. Maybe they'll get damaged in some sort of a storm where a tree falls on them but most of the ways that the average woodland animal's life ends is painful. So we don't think we're doing anything that is outside of the norm of their lives with hunting. They say that we don't treat dogs and cats this way so why would we treat deer and other animals this way? Well, it's because of the purpose of human joy. Because we we value dogs and cats in a different way, that is why we do this is. Is it arbitrary? No, it's how we've grown attached to them over literally millennia as opposed to how we've grown attached to other animals and because of that we don't think that and again overall if animals have no rights than whether or not it's arbitrary doesn't really matter. At the end of the day, we could treat dogs and cats this way without facing any sort of ethical dilemma but we don't because we think they're cute and we want them as our pets. They say that this makes people more violent and that once you start hunting animals you're more likely to be violent against people. We think that this is congruent to the violent video games argument that video games make people more violent but there's no evidence of either of these things happening and oftentimes hunters value animals even more than the average person and try to care for their environment and care for animals more than others. Finally, they say this is bad for wilderness preservation because we only preserve the animals in the environments that hunters care for but I don't see the alternative world having any sort of increased political will to protect other types of wilderness and given that that's the case, we don't think that there's any sort of real trade-off that makes this a winning argument for them. For these reasons, hunting should not be banned.
The blockade of the gaza strip should not be ended. For many years the world has painted a one-sided view of the blockade of the gaza strip and the incidents in gaza a largely anti-israeli view one that paints it as an aggressor going against a defenseless defenseless city in gaza. But we don't think that that view is fully explored and really correct in many ways and for those reasons we think that the blockade of the gaza strip is both justified and should not be ended. The first argument that the government makes is that the gaza strip blockade is essentially a massive humanitarian crisis, that the blockade on the gaza strip is so complete that people struggle to get basic necessities, that they depend on smugglers for these basic necessities and that there's really no way for people to even begin to feed themselves in many instances. This is massively exaggerated. While it's certainly true that the that the quality of life in gaza has not been improved by the blockade on the gaza strip, there is still ample supplies that are provided both from outside from outside areas and also from israel itself. We think that the blockade namely exists to ensure that outside countries aren't bringing in things like weapons, aren't bringing in things that can increase the terrorist activity coming out of gaza. And like we said we think that this idea of gaza being essentially defenseless is a one-sided description. We think that as an independent nation israel has the right to control its borders which includes the borders along its coast. So we think that as far as legitimacy, israel is acting in a legitimate way but additionally, this isn't just an arbitrary action of a blockade but it's a response to a legitimate threat of decades of violence coming out of gaza against israeli citizens targeted at overthrowing the israeli government and that when these types of attacks happen continually especially from a group like hamas, we think that israel is entirely justified in taking these actions to defend itself. Whether or not they are harming the people of gaza is is is inconsequential given the obligations that the state has to protect its own citizens. So we think that in that context the government may be harming citizens of gaza but it is justified in doing so. The second argument that the government makes is that this makes terrorism worse coming out of gaza, that since the blockade hamas is still in power, it's still entrenched and he argues that we are going to breed more terror in the future because of a lack of opportunity. But people recognize that the lack of opportunity that exists because of the blockade is caused by the leadership of hamas in the status quo which we think means that the blockade is actually fairly straightforward. It would likely end and opportunity in the area would likely increase if hamas is removed. Now does this mean that people are being forced into removing a government that they may have chosen legitimately? Certainly. But given that this government exists within the borders of israel, we think that israel is entirely justified in taking drastic actions to ensure that a terrorist organization does not have a seat of government within their own borders and we think that even if it does breed more resentment and more anger towards israel, we think that because of the blockade there are fewer abilities to get the tools of terror that allow damage to actually be done to israeli citizens. So even if resentment is increased, if the actual number of lives lost is lessened, which we think has been the trend over time in israel in the past decade, then we think that israel is being successful in its goal of the blockade which is ultimately to protect its citizens. For these reasons, the blockade of the gaza strip should not be ended.
We should not introduce recall elections. We think that jurisdictions that currently have recall elections should get rid of them and that jurisdictions like massachusetts that don't have recall elections should not introduce them. We have two main points for our side: the first is that this prevents any unpopular but necessary change from being made, and the second is that this encourages the most rank kind of populism, even outside of election years. Rachel tells you that these recall elections are good because they prevent abuse, but realize that ordinary people are unwilling to make any kind of sacrifice to any government policy that benefits them, even though they want to cut every other policy. The average american wants the government to only spend money on programs that are personally to their benefit. People who drive want better roads. People who take the subway want more subsidy for trains. People who live in the country want more subsidies for rural people, etcetera. What this means is that if there were hard but necessary decisions to be made, such as cutting a particular subsidy because it's too expensive or ending a program that employs lots of people in one city, because it doesn't provide enough benefit to the country as a whole, those policies will never be undertaken because of recall elections. Why? Rachel presents this as a check on abuse, but people have different ideas about what constitutes abuse. People are going to recall any governor or senator or representative who tries to pass a law that is contrary to their personal interest. This means that no such law will ever be passed, which means that government programs will get more and more bloated, and it will be more and more difficult to control them for efficiency or in order to limit spending. At the end of the day, recall elections will make the united states even more ungovernable than it is right now. When you consider the fact that we have huge amounts of projects that only exist to employ people and don't actually benefit anyone, such as the famous bridge to nowhere, projects like that will only become more common, and no one will speak up against them if recall elections allow voters to punish them for showing any sort of responsibility to the country as a whole. But our second argument is that this will just lead to more populism. Right now, during election years, politicians say anything they can to appeal to people's most base nature, see donald trump, in order to win votes. Luckily, for the most part, politicians then go on to ignore that populism, outside of election years, and try to govern to the best of their ability. We think that if recall elections were to become more common, then politicians would have to remain in this populist mode of thought all the time. Why is this a problem? Well, first of all, we think it makes them more likely to rely on the " us versus them " rhetoric, even when they're already in office and have to represent everyone. A common trend is that politicians seem very radical during primaries, and then moderate for the general election, and then moderate even more once in office. We think that this is probably because you have to appeal to the most radical group of people in the primary, then less radical in the election, and then the entire population once you're governing. But if you have to worry about radicals recalling you from office or leading to these expensive referenda to recall you from office, then you're always going to have to appeal to those people in order to keep your seat, so it'll be very difficult for any politician to represent all of the people. They will only represent that group that got them elected in order to avoid a recall election. So we think that this will degrade the overall quality of american governance, even lower than it already is which is really saying something, because it's pretty atrocious right now. For all of these reasons, we should not introduce recall elections. Thank you.
We should not limit the right of self-defense. So, before we start, we want to point out an argument right at the top about what this debate is actually about, because the government tries to misconstrue current laws regarding self-defense, saying that you can currently just say there's some sort of nebulous threat and that's always going to justify harm and, instead, you need to show some sort of real threat existed. And while you certainly don't need to show, in the status quo, that a real threat existed, you can be wrong but still get off on self-defense based on self-defense, we think it's important to recognize that there still needs to be a perceived justified use of force. If, in the situation, someone cannot show that they reasonably could have been under duress, they reasonably could have believed there is a real threat that existed for them, in those cases, self-defense does not serve as a defense that's actually going to get you out of criminal prosecution. And just because, in some instances, such as the instance with trayvon martin that people that court cases did not turn out in the way that many people would have liked, this doesn't mean that the laws themselves are not currently reflective of a much higher burden for self-defense than the government lays out. We think that, definitionally, self-defense is a justified use of force. We think that if you're using excessive violence, this doesn't necessarily mean that you are unjustified. But if you're not provoked with some sort of legitimate reason and then you use excessive violence, then we think that is already a crime. We think that if people feel threatened, though, if they feel like their life may be in danger, they shouldn't have to feel like they don't have the ability to defend themselves. They shouldn't have to feel like they're going to get in trouble at the end of the day for doing what needs to be done in order to protect themselves. And quite frankly, most people will not change their behavior patterns correspondingly with changes in self-defense laws because most people, when acting in a way that they believe to be self-defense, are always going to believe that they're justified. It's not like people take violent or racist actions, they go and hurt other people and then just say, " oh, it was self-defense, " and make up a story. No. If people are claiming self-defense, they do believe themselves to be justified. And so changing the law in the way that the government side lays out not only puts a constraint on people that they're never going to follow, but ultimately, we think, is principally wrong, because we think that the current laws are sufficient in how they limit the right of self-defense and that you still can't just make up stories or cite some sort of nebulous law in order to protect yourself. So the first argument that the government side makes is that this is going to fight racism and police brutality. They talk about how there's like an inherent bias in our society that we view black as not safe and white as safe and because of that, bad things happen, like the police killing of unarmed black people. So and they say this directly, say people act recklessly and then just claim self-defense. So, first, we think that their line is still somewhat nebulous. So even if you buy all of their terms, we think the idea that you can just say it was entirely justified, that a real threat existed, well let's look at the case of trayvon martin, because there was an altercation that existed, that occurred there. There was some sort of fight. There isn't evidence of how this fight actually occurred, and so it's very easy to just say there was a that there was a real threat that existed. Whether or not there actually was is something that we cannot know, but we construct our best idea based on the evidence available to us, and that is what's used right now to show whether or not there is a justified belief that a threat existed. And so we don't think their standard actually changes all that much. Finally, when it comes to something like how police are behaving and police brutality, we think issues of police brutality are caused by a system that protects police officers, not because self-defense laws are the way they are, but because there's some there's a lot of institutional backing for police. And so we don't think that actually changing self-defense laws themselves are going to do all that much to rein in police officers. For these reasons, we should not limit the right of self-defense.
Don't have year-round schooling. Sam pretends the only reason that the current system exists is because of agriculture. Even if this is true, we clearly now maintain the system because there are still other benefits to having time off, but also we think that massive parts of the united states are still agriculture-based. So even if it's true that the only reason the system of year-round schooling doesn't exist is because we need breaks to take care of the farm, there are massive swathes of the united states that do need people to take breaks to take care of the farm. So we just think that this is absurd. He also spends a lot of time talking about how people should wake up later, but this isn't unique to creating year-round schooling systems. We can do that, too, without year-round school, just by adding another hour at the end of the day and letting people come in later. There, problem solved. He also talks about guarantees for students having a meal a day, and we think that this is true that it is important, but we think that there are other reasons that this can still occur on our side, or it's just outweighed by the arguments we'll talk about later. First, we think that there are subsidized government summer programs that solve for this in a lot of areas, but also we think that the students who benefit off of this are the same students who need summer off in order to be able to work more full-time jobs so that they'll have the money to study during the school year. Two main arguments, first that it's better for children. Sam is right that the students are exhausted and unfocused, but he doesn't seem to understand that year-round school would make that worse. School is something that is exhausting emotionally, physically, and mentally. It forces kids to stick to a very strict schedule, stay seated for hours of the day, and interact in controlled social interactions with populations of individuals they likely don't want to be interacting with in the first place. These are conditions that adults are capable of dealing with because adults are more developed and have built up stamina, but for children, this is a really high ask, especially since physically, children have more energy and require more time outside and being physically active than adults do. It's also bad for their emotional and mental development to be overloaded with work all the time. Summer break is a good way of creating more of a balance when it comes to work. It still prepares kids for the real world and provides them with the positive parts of an education, learning and other skills, but still gives them a long enough uninterrupted period of freedom that they don't feel too overwhelmed. In this way, summer break prevents fatigue, while year-round schooling would exist would exhaust kids to the point that they would feel like education is unenjoyable. This is how we see burnout happen in a lot of countries that these kinds of systems exist in. People who go through year-round school before college are burned out by the time they get to higher learning and don't perform as well as they would have. Our second argument is that it's important for extracurriculars. This is more important than sam's argument about consistent education, because we don't actually need that consistency in order for people to learn, right? But we do need this time to help build up resumes and other things. First, it just give students the opportunity to do something besides school. The first independent point applies best to elementary and middle school kids, but we think that summer is really important for high schoolers as well. During the school year, you rarely have time for anything besides classes and school-focused extracurriculars, maybe a job if you need it, but you can't allocate very much time to it. You don't have time to throw yourself into intense projects or full-time job positions. Summer gives in an uninterrupted span of time in which high schoolers can do things like take extra classes at a nearby university or pick up an internship. This is good both on a personal level and in terms of building resumes for college. It's also better for those in poverty in that summer provides a span of time where people have who have to work to help provide for their families can build a little bit of a nest egg or at least contribute more to make up for the time during the year that they won't be able to work for the same extent. We think that this lets people strike a healthy work-life balance. Large populations of kids who are lower middle class, who don't have enough money to not to not have to work, but if they can up their hours over the summer, they can do less work during their class time, and this lets people who still need to work, either way, make more money. Proud to oppose.
We should not introduce recall elections. The government side presents to you two main arguments in favor of recall elections, but we think they're both shortsighted and overconfident in the degree of their impact. So let's walk through those. The first argument and the largest argument they make is about accountability, saying that people that are elected to office often do bad things, they don't keep their promises, etcetera. A couple of responses to this: first, in instances when there is true abuse of office, whether it's taking bribes, whether it's using your political office to threaten others, whatever it may be, in cases of true abuse, there are already laws in place that protect against this and will remove someone from office if they do those types of things. But they say that there's just no accountability, but recognize that not only is there an election for the office that person is serving, such as the governorship, every few years, but there's also elections that impact that governor's party that they are concerned with. So it's not just like they say that in if you elect a governor in wisconsin that, for six years, you're just stuck with that person and there's no accountability. You can vote his party out of office if you don't like what he's doing and, in fact, that's what we see in US mid-terms fairly frequently in instances where there aren't recall elections. And so we don't think that it's the case that there's no accountability whatsoever during or in-between election cycles, but rather that politicians constantly need to maneuver in order to keep their party being viewed favorably. They say under this that fewer bad people will run, but in addition to the argument that I already made about laws that exist to prevent abuse, being a political being in political office is already insanely profitable, even if you aren't abusing your office. There's many people that get into it for selfish reasons because they know when they're in political office, they can make connections and they can get cushy job somewhere else doing something like advising some sort of corporation, or lobbying, or things like this, and this is what most politicians do after they leave office. So we don't think that this actually detracts people from running. They say that we'll get more honest policy proposals, but we think there's two problems with this. The first is that this is often not an issue of honesty when people are making promises that they can't keep, but rather it's inexperience in the office they're going to take, and therefore we think that people are still going to make big promises, especially because that's what they need to do in order to seem more favorable than their opponent. But the other issue and we think the biggest issue with recall elections is that oftentimes large policy proposals, big things, take a long time to pass. There's lots of bureaucracy you need to go through. There's political maneuvering that occurs. Take obamacare, for instance. Obamacare took almost two years to get passed, even though it was a big proposal that he presented. If recall elections existed and people were held to short time spans and weren't able to serve out their term, this means that people make more hasty policy in order to fulfill their promises, which we think ultimately leads to worse policy. The last argument they make is about democratic engagement and that there, again, they say there's no real way to impact the government between elections, and people'll be more engaged. Firstly, this is empirically not true. Political engagement in wisconsin, the example that the government team gets, is not higher than it is anywhere else in the united states. It's not that more people turn out. This is not the tipping point for what people have for when people have trust in their government or don't. But additionally, lobbying, protesting, grassroots organizing, organizing in small local elections to change the political tide, all of these things are major things that someone can do between elections that, frankly, will have a larger impact than a recall election proposal that oftentimes won't even get off the ground. For these reasons, we should not introduce recall elections.
Don't legalize public nudity. There is a major problem with the idea that james has that he's legalizing non-sexual nudity. The definition of non-sexual is absurdly nebulous. Men are literally one boner away from being sexually nude even if they start out not so. And women of particular races or body types are more likely to be sexualized than others. So even when they might think they are being non-sexually nude, other people are likely to label them as sexual anyway. Given that this is an undefinable standard, we don't think this should be allowed in general. Still we can have spaces set aside for public nudity like nude beaches, resorts, lounges, etcetera. We just don't think that public nudity should be the norm in the rest of broad society. Three main arguments, first on preventing harassment. Men are scary and we think that a lot of the time what happens is that when given power or given any kind of like physical ability to harass women they often do. Like it's just easier to harass women when you're naked because you can just point your boner or rub up against someone in a much more lewd way than if you had clothing on. It also makes it harder to catch these kinds of instances because there are more people who are naked so whereas like on the subway if someone whips their dick out, that is something that is instantly continued instantly considered illegal and crude. On government's side this begins to be a gray area where it's a lot harder to actually be able to pick out which situations are harassment and which aren't, our second argument is about respecting personal preference. James is wrong. There are victims of public nudity. It does harm other people besides the person being nude. We want to talk about sexual assault survivors because it might they they are likely to feel justifiably uncomfortable and threatened by genitalia in public. But there are also groups like young children who shouldn't be exposed to that yet and they get forced into sexualisation by adults who don't have boundaries when public nudity is more allowed. Like yes we understand that even when people are fully clothed, it is easy to make someone uncomfortable or threaten them or do any number of sexual objectification. But we think that when someone is nude that gives them a unique way to exert power over other people because they essentially remove that boundary between the world in their naked bodies and the other person. Then we want to talk about people who are religious. Like we just don't think that these people should be hand waved. Like their religious preferences are important. The good is idiosyncratic. People can be naked in private but we should respect peoples' comforts in public when it harms their psyche. We also just don't think this is like a preference that people want, right? Like most people feel uncomfortable around nudity from people they don't know. And even if it is arbitrary that's still a fair preference. Moreover we think we should differ to over protection in these situations. It doesn't hurt people to not be publicly nude but it can still be harmful for others to see everyone being nude all of the time. Our third argument is just that it's physically bad. We think that body shaming becomes worse now because you can see what people look like under their clothes all the time. So you'll have individuals who are conventionally attractive feel comfortable being naked and people who are bigger who aren't. And when those larger people are bigger we just think they're infinitely more likely to get like a bit made fun of and made to feel insecure about their bodies on government's side, as well as the fact that they're just going to be continually normalizing like conventional skinniness or conventional attractiveness. We also think this makes people very prone to things like sunburn which can literally cause cancer so maybe don't do that, but also hygiene is an issue here. Like sitting on seats that you get all sweaty now because you don't have any jeans to keep your butt sweat from leaking on to them. Like also genitals tend to leak a little bit right? Like there's just like secretions that occur and we think that they're pretty gross and shouldn't expose be exposed the rest of the world all the time. Proud to oppose.
There are at least two different ways in which side government is trying to fool us into supporting their side. The first way is by mischaracterizing how slum tourism actually looks like. They make it sound as if it's only about people that you know hop by for a short visit of an hour or two in the favela, take some pictures, and at best spend a bit of money in the local restaurant and then go back to sleep in their fancy hotel in the city center. But this is very different to the reality of what slum tourism actually looks like. The truth is that when we talk about slum tourism we talk many times about people that plan full trips to impoverished neighborhoods in which they sleep at the local guest house, eat only local food, and in general try to absorb this full experience of what it's like to live in these places. That is the concept of slum tourism. Now that is important because this more accurate description shows us that the government is wrong in saying that the like the the economic good things that come to these places from slump tourism is negligible. This also counters their claim on how there is no trickle down effect here since this entire phenomenon of slum tourism like the more it gets popular and the more tourists come, this means that more money is coming in and you'd have to open more guest house and new restaurants and this means that we can like hire more people and so on. These are just the most basic and simple laws of economics. So the second way that they try to trick us is by conveniently forgetting or just failing or not bothering to mention or to talk about the comparative. They offer us no alternative for these neighborhoods. They talk a lot a lot about how slum tourism creates a national incentive to keep these neighborhoods poor and therefore it delays their development but what development are they talking about exactly? In their world, no one from the outside bothers go like bothers to go there. No one is being exposed to their situation. The government most certainly does don't have any special incentive to change their conditions. These people are not a political threat in any way. No sane businessmen would ever dream of investing there. So what government side is actually offering here is to simply forget all about these people's existence. So we think that the questions in this debate is where is there a bigger chance to improve the conditions of people living in the favelas or in like poverty stricken neighborhoods even by a little bit? So we've already explained why the money that's coming in directly from tourism is meaningful and does bring to a small improvement in the conditions and we already see that this is better for than anything that government side has to offer but we say more than this, we think that the exposure that slum tourism creates allows for a bigger change in the long run because it's only by personally seeing poverty with your own eyes that we can penetrate the walls of indifference of people that live in the west. What I haven't experienced for myself no matter how much I read about it in the newspapers or see you know videos about it on my news feed, I will not go the extra mile and will not make the extra step of actually you know donating money or actually going and volunteering or thinking how can I help. We don't expect in every tourist that come that that's coming there to actually do something. It's enough that one out of a thousand will come back home and tell his his rich friends and will bring them over to see for their own eyes and that they together will think of how they can do some good there. This is how little by little you create change. So for all of these reasons please supports slum tourism and oppose the motion.
We should not cancel the patriot act. On our side, we think that if the patriot act were repealed, it would actually lead to a much worse world, and all of the harms that are done by the patriot act could, in fact, be magnified. We have two main arguments. The first is that congress today is much worse than they were in two thousand one, and the second is a response to rachel's points about people's rights. So, first, I think that you have to recognize that if we were to repeal the patriot act today, it would be the current congress making decisions about what would replace it. So you have to ask yourself: who do you trust to make better decisions, the congress that was elected in two thousand or the congress that was elected in twenty sixteen? Given the existence of many far-right republicans and tea partiers in congress and in the senate today, I think that the senate now is actually less responsible, as we can see from their inability to, say, create a budget, or to end stupid wars in iraq, or to deal with pressing economic problems. It's become increasingly clear that our government is dysfunctional, and while that was the case in two thousand, it was less the case. So I think that rachel needs to explain to you why we would get a better bill out of the current congress run by paul ryan than we got out of the one in two thousand. I'd like to respond here to what rachel said about political will. A couple of things: one, it doesn't matter if the american people like a bill, it matters if their representatives do. We have a trustee system of government. If people don't like a bill, then they can choose not to reelect their representative, but people generally do reelect incumbents. And I think, most importantly, george bush won by a significant margin in two thousand four, which would seem to indicate that people actually were supportive of the patriot act and people did opt into this, since he was so closely associated with the patriot act. And in response to what rachel tells you about how people were irrational after nine eleven, I'm really curious when they've become rational since. Is the america that elected donald trump more rational than the america of two thousand one? Has a congress that can't pass a budget or agree on literally anything, a congress that just approved a known rapist to be a supreme court justice actually going to do a better job at this than the congress that existed then? People were definitely afraid after nine eleven, but that doesn't undermine the validity of what they did. Rachel made the comparison of people who are too drunk to consent, but I don't think that the country was drunk after nine eleven. Well, maybe that evening, but in general, like this law was passed by people who were sober and trying to do their best to deal with a difficult situation. For our second claim, we're going to talk about the rights that rachel brought up and why we don't think that the patriot act is necessarily rights violative. First of all, rights exist by convention, not by nature. If the public says that there's no right to privacy by voting for representatives who make laws that undermine privacy, then there is no right to privacy. Right? There's no like word of god that gives people the right to privacy. It doesn't exist in nature. So it's unclear to me where people could get it except from the law. And if the law is explicitly created so that people don't have a right to privacy, which is not unique to the patriot act, then people don't have a right to privacy. I mentioned that the violations of people's privacy are not unique to the patriot act. Neither are secret courts. Right? Many of the court's rachel talked about, where you can be charged, where warrants can be issued by judges who have no public accountability, where people are convicted without ever being able to face their accusers, exist for other reasons as well. There was a an act to authorize routine spending for the military a few years ago that included provisions for secret courts, for instance. This isn't just a patriot act problem. This is a larger problem with american culture, and getting rid of the patriot act wouldn't restore democratic norms or protect people's right to a fair trial. For all of these reasons, we should not cancel the patriot act. Thank you.
Two things in this debate: one, on how blocks bring more power to the region, and two, on how economic dependence between nations is a good thing. Particularly in an otherwise rather tense region of the world. A few points of refutation to yaar: before we go to the arguments. One, yaar starts out with the assumption that this has been tried for years and has failed. We're not entirely sure where he gets the notion that it's failed. He goes on to tell you that countries like singapore and malaysia are some of the richest countries in the world. That's because their GDP has been rising for years that doesn't seem like failure. Also, these countries haven't had a war between them in years. Also probably a good thing. Like, we're not sure what the mark of success yaar is trying to reach is, but it seems that these countries are at least partially doing well. That may be a marker of success. Two, yaar says: look, there's no unifying factor. That's exactly the point. See yaar never tells you why religion or a type of governance is the form of unifying factor. What it tells you is in order for countries to care for each other, to cooperate they need a reason. Something that unifies them. Crucially, we see no reason why this unifying factor can't be invented. We think the ASEAN is exactly that unifying factor. By signing these agreements by signing these accords they are actively creating a unifying factor. Something that if they win they all win and if they lose they all lose. This is the way that countries unite together regardless of history. We think that's a great unifying factor. Thirdly yaar says there's imbalance in ASEAN. Some of the countries are rich some of them are poor and that creates tensions. He's sort of right. You have to compare to the counter factual. It's not like outside of ASEAN thailand would've been rich. They would've been poor and probably would have been substantially poorer. And it's not like that wouldn't have gone to singapore and malaysia for money and for assistance because they would have needed the assistance. The only problem is it would have had to re-negotiate that assistance time and time again. They would've been turned down half the time. That's the kind of thing that creates uncomfort. That's the kind of thing that creates tensions between two countries. So they're right to an extent, the fact that some of the countries are richer and some of the countries are poorer creates tensions, but it's the kind of tensions you get between your older brother and younger brother, not the kind of tensions you get between a poor person and the bank. And that's what we're trying to keep. First argument: blocks bring more power. By uniting in ASEAN they've created more than just an economic agreement. They've also created a voting block. This voting block is beneficial to them in more than just ASEAN but also outside of it in places like the UN or in places like WTO. This is massively beneficial to each and every one of these countries because alone they are very weak in voting power but together they actually have some sort of influence on a global level. Secondly, economic dependence between nations in a tense region is a very good thing. If you look at what happens in a lot of the rest of asia there are tensions between countries. The reason there are tensions between countries is because there's a battle between countries over resources, over land, over geographical areas. At the point at which you're economically dependent on other nations within the region the likelihood of tensions between those nations drops significantly and that we think is one of the most crucial things that any accords do. Please continue to support ASEAN.
I'm going to start by addressing the three points made by the previous speaker and then move on to discuss the harms in polygamy. So first we hear that banning polygamy is is like a religious discrimination. We hear that the the main reason originally for this ban is the church and how wrong it is for the state to create laws that are based on a certain dominant religion. Unfortunately this entire point is just off clash because we agree. We agree that religious norms are not a legitimate source for creating laws. We would simply argued that there are other very good reasons that concern protecting our citizens from harm and from abuse. Note that we don't have and we shouldn't have any problems with laws that go out against customs of certain religions if we think that this that we are that we are dealing with unreasonable norms that create a lot of harm. For instance we ban female mutilation and we don't care if there are people whose religion dictates this. Then we hear that this is a victimless crime. Why? Because you testified you testified before a judge that you weren't coerced. So this shows that you weren't coerced. We think that this is a very naive argument and literally all of our positive material engages directly with this notion. And then we hear that this is unenforceable. There's no way to prevent people from living in polygamous households. Now this might be true but the problem with this argument is that it fails to recognize the power that laws have in shaping the reality, in shaping people's consensus. While it might be true that there are some people today that that have polygamous relationships, once this will be officially legal there are going to be a lot more of those. Because this lifestyle now is granted with the official stamp of the state and of the constitution. And this means something to people. So like insofar as we are going to show that this is a harmful phenomenon, we can live with this still happening at the margins of society, but we would not like to encourage more of it. So finally, what are the harms in polygamy? We think it's cute that james defines this as something ultra liberal like you could have a woman with several husbands or same sex polygamy households, but realistically ninety nine percent of the cases we are talking about a model of a man living with several wives. We are talking about the muslim population and perhaps the mormon population even though we think that this is less relevant today. In israel for instance we're talking about the bedouin population and in these cases it's not exactly it doesn't match the liberal picture that james tries to paint. By like of a group of women that fall in love with this guy or that had like that had any right to choose their husbands and they give their full consent willingly and happily. We are often like on in most occasions we're talking about wives that were matched, without anyone asking their opinions, to a husband. We are very often talking about very old men taking a new wife every every couple of years. A young wife that has become the like in the legal age and these wives usually stay at home and serve at their husbands pleasure. We think that this structure of a family isn't proper and shouldn't be acceptable. It oppresses women. That's it like these wives that will now have to compete with the other wives over their husbands resources or attention or whatever. It harms the children that will be brought up in a very complicated dynamic and it harms the status of women in society as a whole and entrenches this notion of women that are meant to serve their husband. So for all of these reasons we think that there is significant harm here and this ban is justified.
Side government think that they're being ethical. We say that when a person is terminally ill, and each passing day that he continues to live it means excruciating pain, and he begs to the doctor, the only person that can help them end this agony, there is nothing ethical about shutting your ears and hiding behind rules and regulations. The government keeps referring to assisted suicide as a damaging procedure. We say that we should look at it as an act of mercy and kindness. Let's answer their arguments one by one. So firstly, they say that this is a breach of the medical ethics, because doctors are sworn to do whatever they can to help save lives. This argument might have worked in cases in which there is still any chance of saving the life of the patient, but what if he is terminally ill? There is no contradiction here to the oath that doctors take to do everything in order to save lives, because saving their lives is no longer an option. Now, they tell us that the will of the person plays no part, that society always gets to decide when it comes to health treatment. This is just not accurate. Society intervenes only in cases where we have reasons to think that the agency of the person is compromised in a way that doesn't allow for him to make the best decision for himself. This is why we institutionalize mental patients, this is why we put addicts in rehabilitation programs. But people in their right minds can definitely turn down treatments, they do this all the time. You cannot force an adult to go through chemotherapy, for instance, without his consent, even if it's the only way to save his life. So yeah, the will of the patient definitely plays a vital part. So, the government tries to tell us that sick people or people that are ill, just like mental patients or addicts, cannot reach the right decision themselves. But there is no analysis as to why this is true and we simply reject this. We say that you are the only only one that knows firsthand just how much you suffer from your condition, and therefore it must be your choice to make. Next, they tell us that there are perverse incentives and, you know, pressure for from the side of insurance agencies on doctors to offer suicide. We say that this is a problem that can easily be fixed through the right mechanism. We think that this problem could not have occurred if we would arrange for an a mechanism that says that that this step can only come from the side of the patient, no doctor can ever offer this initially, and that we would have to go through several stages and, you know, committees and whatnot in order to ascertain that you that this is absolutely something that the patient wants and so on. And lastly, they say that you cannot reach a an educated decision on dying. But this is just off clash, because this is not a debate on whether suicide is is legitimate or not, this debate asks whether in the situation in which the patient has already decided that he wants to take his own life, would it be okay to assist. This debate is about how much the will of the patient plays a part, in a and this is a question that we have already answered before. So this is not about whether suicide is a good or a bad idea, and therefore this entire argument is just off clash. So, because we saw that the will of the patient does play a vital role and must play a vital role, we are happy to oppose.
Don't ban school uniforms. Sam asserts that uniforms aren't unique in their benefit from clothing limitations in other ways, but this is just untrue. It prevents schools from being able to equalize school children when it comes to what they wear and forces schools to have to deal with the enforcement of those specific clothing regulation rules. And I actually think that the thing that sam talks about with uniforms where he says that they tend to be sexist and unfair to women applies even more when it comes to dress codes more generally that just regulate individual aspects of clothing. Because that's when you get rules that unfairly target woman's shoulders or the length of their skirt and that's also when you get assymmetry of enforcement with individual teachers deciding to just getting to decide what's appropriate instead of an over arching uniform or rule that says here's what is meant. So even if there are problematic sexist ops aspects to both situations, we think it's always going to be easier to make a school dress code sexist than a school uniform sexist because that dress code allows individual rules to be made dependent on gender, whereas the school uniform has to be like some semblance of appropriate skirts or pants or shirts. And especially now parents can often push for schools to change those uniforms. If they feel like they are too restrictive or if they feel like they are too gendered, those are things we've seen in a lot of areas with school uniforms is that they've been a lot better about accommodating for women who don't want to constantly look feminine in the way that has been done in the past. So we actually think we just do it better on our side of the house. With that, three arguments, first on promoting learning. We want children to focus on classes, not on what they're wearing, but more on what they're learning. Clothing adds an entire new aspect to education in that everyone wants to keep up with trends and look good, and it takes on a lot of personal meaning and therefore a lot of energy for kids. We want clothing to not even be a worry for them. Sam is worried about the first amendment, but this would only be in cases of political speech which students can still exercise in the form of wristbands, signs, conversations, protests, literally anything else besides the shirt you're wearing. And this might make sense if clothing was the only way for for students to access free speech but we've shown you it's not. Moreover as sam mentioned, schools aren't obligated to give the same protections as common society is. This is why schools can search your lockers and things like that. So insofar as that is true, we just don't think he has any offense on freedom of speech. Sam says that kids won't self actualize. We think this is also just untrue. They can just wear the things they want after school if that's important, but if anything we think this has allowed them to show their creativity in other ways while they are in school rather than relying on clothing that can be bought with money. Our second argument is about why it's good for social and economic hierarchy. There isn't anything archaic about these kinds of rules. As the income gap in the united states ever widens, it is even more important to prevent these class differences from seeping into school environments where kids should not be bothered by this. Schools will often find kids aligning themselves along class lines and one of the ways in which this happens is via the type of clothing that someone wears. It instantly signals what that person can or can't afford, and it can be used as a basis for bullying or exclusions. And we actually just think this outweighs all of sam's arguments about buying cheap pants at goodwill because if your kid is getting bullied for those cheap pants we think that's bad. Whereas if a parent can't afford a new uniform we think that the ability to keep two pairs and just make sure your kid takes really good care of that is something that a parent could exercise infinitely more control over. So that deals with that argument. Our third argument is about why it's cheaper. When parents have to buy clothing for kids they have to buy a lot more than if they just pay for two sets of uniforms that get cycled through. Even if they're shopping sales or at thrift shops, it's still amounts that add up over time significantly more than just uniforms, especially given that a lot of the time children want to look good and often resent the idea that they might not be able to afford that process. Proud to oppose.
We should not prohibit slum tourism. We think that what the government side has tried to do in this round is paint a picture of slum tourism that looks at it like every tourist company that goes through is some massive corporation run in a foreign country, that every rich person that comes through is pointing and laughing at the local at the locals there, and that the locals are somehow captives in their in their surroundings and, additionally, that rich people from the west just never care about the situations when they leave, and that everything that they learn on the surface level just phases through them after a couple of weeks. So, while this is certainly true of some slum tourism, we think it's important to recognize that like any other industry, slum tourism has a variety of different aspects and a variety of different practices that takes place, that ranges from people just going in, in these worst-case scenarios, like the government side said, but also people often provide like do service projects in these areas, they work directly like these companies work directly with local communities, and sometimes these companies are, surprisingly, not very large and are actually run by locals in these areas. So, we think there's three direct benefits of slum tourism. The first is that, to some degree, some revenue comes in to these areas because of slum tourism. And while a very small amount of revenue may not seem like a big deal to the government side, it can actually be quite a massive deal to people that are living on less than a dollar a day, which is often what we see in the slums. The second thing is that we think that it bridges the empathy gap. We think that even if you're only seeing these people for a short period of time and you're not really getting to know them, actually being in these areas makes you understand what it is like to live in that situation in a way that you can never get just from watching it on TV or from seeing it on the internet. And we think that while that empathy gap being bridged doesn't always provide positive outcomes in the end, if it does in some instances, that is preferable than having it never occur. And thirdly, we think that as a free business and as a free society, because there's no direct third-party harm being created for the people that live in these areas, we'll address the harms that the government side tries to bring up in a second, but because there's no direct third-party harm, we think that these businesses should be free to operate. So let's respond directly to the government side. The first thing they talk about is the profiting of suffering, and they say, who really benefits from this? Mainly just large corporations and rich westerners who don't end up doing anything. So cross apply the arguments I've already made about the variety of different corporations and even non-corporate entities that run these tours, and two, cross apply the argument I made about the empathy gap being bridged and that for some people they really do act upon these tours. But, finally, they say locals are actively harmed because they're degraded, and they compare them to like animals in a zoo, but it's just not the case that they're like animals in the zoo. There's no direct harm from someone coming through there. Like, let's let's look at it in this way: if you're living in a slum, how much worse is your life being made if someone is going through your community and occasionally taking a picture of your community? Like you don't go into these people's homes or anything. We think this is just a a mischaracterization of what these tours look like, on the government side. But the final thing the government says actually contradicts every single thing they say before that, which is that slum tourism leads to gentrification. If this is true, then it means that people take an active investment in the community and try to put money into the community directly by living there, by working there, by doing those types of things and, clearly, slum tourism would be a benefit. But we think that slum tourism has never led to gentrification in any given area. And I think the government side making the comparison of how gentrification leads to a whole foods instead of a stop and shop acknowledges this. Because slum tourism is not taking place in harlem, it's taking place in the slums of mumbai, and these are areas that people are just not moving into. And even if a few individuals did move into the slums of mumbai, it's not going to raise housing prices dramatically, because they are still slums. For these reasons, we should not prohibit slum tourism.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have an interesting opposition line for you today. Let's see how this goes. We fully accept that there is a problem with beauty pageants in the status quo, but unlike proposition, we do not think that the root of the problem lies with objectification itself, but rather with the inequality or the disproportionality of that objectification and that is what we aim to fix. That's right, rather than less female beauty pageants, we offer more dominance to male beauty pageants and male objectification in general. We believe that true liberation for women means having them treated equally. For decades, we have tried to achieve that goal by changing our approach or the way that we treat women. This has worked partially and very slowly and unlike we would have wanted. Perhaps it's time to change our approach and change the way that we treat men. Specifically, we advocate in this debate that the already existing and rapidly growing phenomenon of things like chippendales, backstreet boys, one direction and justin bieber. Now, here's something that I never thought that I would say. Truly, our line is simple. We simply say that people are naturally attracted to beauty. We are programmed to rate the other sex based on appearance. This is true to both men and women. The problem is that for centuries, male dominance has led our society to a situation in which it is no longer socially acceptable for women to publicly rate men on their appearance, whereas to men, this is still considered okay. In this point, we are required to choose between waging war against human nature, one that we that would be basically impossible for us to win because it's a war against our nature, or harnessing our nature to obtain our our purpose. Why do we think that the second option is better? Because the true problem today is that many men feel that they can appreciate women solely based on their appearance, but in a world where men and women are being objectified left and right, we say that men no longer have the privilege of their like, genders that of their gender being considered superior. There is this perceived equality that trickles down to the minds of men and women alike. This is obviously a gradual situation, but we believe that in within a few generations, we will most definitely be there. As a result, we think that society would have no choice but to change in such a way that no one is rated no one is rating no one solely based on appearance, but based on also appearance alongside smarts and capabilities and every other thing that we would would like people to be valued by. Why? Why is this true? Because society needs those metrics and it will never allow a situation where everyone are being rated and ranked solely based on appearance. So, at the point in which there is no longer one sex that we can objectify and another sex that's being that's being valued by other parameters, we say that everyone is gonna be judged by all of the parameters. So, if you guys ever want to truly achieve real equality for women, you have to oppose this motion.
We should not increase immigration to the united states. So, the first thing we're going to do in this round is explain why we think that the status quo is sufficient, why there's no obligation to increase the immigration that we currently allow, and then we're going to go and directly rebut the arguments made by the government side. So, first, we would say fundamentally that the state has no obligations to people in other parts of the world. Why do we think that this is the case? First, we would disagree with the sort of liberal notion that rights are somehow inherent to our humanity. Rights, rather, are are not inherent to our humanity. If you look at the vast majority of human history, there was no such thing as human rights. There was no such thing as a guarantee of property or some sort of guarantee of life, or movement, or anything like that. We think that rights, rather, are a construct of the societies in which we live and if that is the case, we think the state's primary and overriding obligations are to the citizens of that state, as the citizens of that state are: one, those that are bound to the laws that it has created and therefore are under the restraint of the state ; but two, those citizens are the body by which the body to which the state is is constructed to serve. So given that that's the case, we think that while certainly the state can give consideration to outside sources or outside people, its overriding obligations are to its citizenry. We think that the current levels of immigration to the united states are entirely sufficient. We still let in thousands upon thousands of people every year. We let in people that have no that have no level of economic prosperity. We let in people from all over the world. And we think that the status quo allows for many of the pragmatic things, like a spread of culture and a distribution of resources, a competitive labor market, all of those things, without draining too many government resources that are otherwise obliged to current citizens of the united states. So that being said, we think that the current levels are sufficient to get the pragmatic benefits the government says, but let's talk about the government's principal now. They say, essentially, they would have a system of open borders which, first, I think would dramatic would lead to a dramatic increase in international chaos if, all of a sudden, this the united states allowed for open borders, and people started to try and flee in droves to the united states. The amount of population movement, the amount of chaos that would ensue from that, we think, is ridiculous and also would create a massive resource strain on the united states, making it impossible for the united states to maintain any sort of quality of life for its people, or for these new citizens that are coming in as well. But what they say is a principle to justify this is that freedom of movement is a fundamental universal right that arises from our humanity. But as we explained earlier in this debate, we don't think that these things actually exist. They try to use confirmation bias by saying: look, no matter what culture you look at, certain things we view as abhorrent in those cultures, things like murder or opposing murder are relatively universal, these types of things. But just because certain things arise in different societies, simultaneously, does not make them some sort of universal truth or thing that must be followed, and therefore we think that rights exist, certainly, within our structures, and there are some sort of structures that exist on the global scale, but the right to become a citizen in another country is certainly not one of those. They say, then, that movement is a facilitative right, that you need to be able to move places in order to balance out the the arbitrary nature of your birthplace, but I don't think that the arbitrary nature of your birthplace then justifies that you are deserving of some sort of new citizenship. While, sure, all people may have some sort of inherent moral worth, we don't think that this gives, then, every single person a right to the exact equal share of everything in the world, and we think that that's just kind of a liberal pipe dream. For these reasons, we should not increase immigration to the united states.
We should not fight global warming. So, in this round, we're not gonna take the stances I think that the government side thought we were going to take. We are not climate change deniers. We believe, in fact, that global warming is a serious long-term and short-term threat to the survival of humanity. The problem that we see is not that global warming is not a threat, but rather it is a threat that is so large and so definitive that it is unlikely that we will be able to do anything in the next several years to make a meaningful dent on the impacts that are going to come from global warming. Because of that, we think that when you're thinking about fighting global warming, what does this mean? It means limiting the resources you can use to green technologies. It means limiting the actions you take to impact the environment. It means limiting your development as a country. All of these things we think you shouldn't do, because we think that countries around the world should develop as much as possible, as quickly as possible, using whatever resources are available to them in order to prepare for the changes that are going to come from global warming. This means building up massive floodwalls. This means developing a ton of new real estate inland of current countries. This means trying to overfarm as much as you can so that you can yield surplus crops to to be able to get ready for the downturn that's probably coming to agriculture. It means investing in desalination which can in and in itself cause more carbon emissions. All these things are necessary in order to ensure that the worst outcomes of global warming, which are almost certainly going to happen, do as little damage as possible to the human species. So that being said, we should address the arguments that the government makes, even though we don't really disagree with them on a principled level. The first argument they make is that, first, most importantly, the economy doesn't matter if it costs tons of human deaths. And we agree, but we don't think that the purpose of development is necessarily to make people richer, but it's rather to get as much infrastructure built up in a much and especially inland as possible in order to have some sort of stable footing for your society that it can weather hard times. Next, the government side goes on to say that global warming is a threat. And they point out that this is a fact of science, that in the short term, there's billions of dollars of damage and loss and deaths every single year because of natural disasters that are being made worse by climate change and that in the long term, it could make the earth virtually uninhabitable. Yes, all of these things are true. The problem with this, though, is that in order for us to actually make such in order for us to make a change in our current society to the point where we are not definitively going to to exceed something like a four four degrees celsius warming by the end of the century, on average, we would need to make such an immense changes to our society. It would essentially mean we have to stop using all fossil fuels in all societies, right now, which is impossible. Just based on how our society is founded, that change is never going to happen. So, if we're not going to go all in on this fight to the point where it makes a difference, we should instead go into preparation for doomsday rather than trying to waste resources that otherwise could have been used to build up our survival strategy. Finally, the government side goes on to explain why global warming is going to be economically bad, that you're gonna lose a lot of a lot of land for housing and crops, diseases are likely to spread, etcetera, and that innovation comes from green technology, which is a benefit of the fight against global warming. And we're fine with green technology but for economic purposes, not not at the exclusion of fossil fuels and not in this kind of drive to fight global warming. Because, as we've stated, based on what many scientists have measured, we simply are not making the fundamental changes that we need to make and, at this point, cannot make those fundamental changes quick enough without massive upheaval and loss of human life in and of itself, and instead of fighting fighting global warming, we should prepare for global warming. For these reasons, we should not fight global warming.
Two things were gonna talk about. One, when fast food is the right decision to make, and two, on the right to choose fast food, which note tim does not discuss, not for a moment, on what gives the government a right to ban such a thing. Before that three points of refutation: one, tim states at the beginning of his speech, fast food is unhealthy, it's inherently unhealthy. Note this is a, untrue about the unhealthiness of fast food but b, certainly untrue comparatively to other foods. So for example, lots of people are eating bacon for breakfast. That's less healthy than a mcdonald's egg mcmuffin or whatever it is that you want to eat. Lots of people are eating doughnuts for breakfast from dunkin' donuts. That's less healthy. So we're not entirely sure why he's picking on fast food but for the sake of the debate, we'll assume that the fast food he's banning is only the unhealthy ones. Fine. Secondly, he says: " you choose the quicker option and then you force them to make and then by by by banning that, you force them to make a healthy decision. " So, let's take a look at what that decision is likely to look like. Because what's crucial about fast food and what's inherent about fast food is that it is faster than other food options. It's faster because you don't need to take the time to prepare it. It's also faster because even if you're talking about minimal things like a sandwich, then you don't need to go three times a week to the store to get fresh bread and to resupply your, whatever it is that you wanna put in your sandwich and generally the things you put in your sandwich are either a, unhealthy or b, cooked. Meaning they take time to put in your sandwich. So, you're creating a situation in which people, who are stressed for time and don't have very much time, are now forced to create time out of thin air. What does that look like in poor families? Generally what that looks like is that you force one of the two household members to stay home to care for the household needs such as cooking etcetera and generally, we say that is likely going to be the oppression of a woman. All of this are bad alternatives when you take someone who, note by tim's own admission, chooses something and you force him into something else. Lastly, tim says: " look the comparative on our side of the house is a sandwich. " We already told you sandwiches take way more time but crucially, they're not actually more healthy. It's white bread coupled with something likely to be either hard cheese or deli meat, all of these are a, unhealthy in and of themselves and b, lack nutritional variety in the way that even fast food does substantially better. One, when is fast food the right decision? On an both on individual level and on a familial level often it is right to prioritize your short term your long term economy over your short term health. What does that mean? It means that, for example, I want to work two jobs a day so I can make sure that my children have enough time to are able to both go to school and to have private tutors in order to advance them in their academia and have a roof over their head. All of this means that I spend most of my time away from home and don't have a lot of time to prepare food. This means I may often prioritize feeding them fast food. However, this prioritization is not necessarily a wrong thing. The same is true for me as an individual. I can choose, for example, to work as a legal intern for twelve hours a day, leaving me little to no time to buy and prepare my own healthy food, out of the knowledge that this is a short term thing, I work this way for five years and for the rest of my life I can eat the world's greatest vegan food, because I'm a high powered attorney who can afford it. All of this means that the individual has many individual circumstances in which it might be the correct decision for that person to prioritize long term goals over short term health. Why do they have the right to choose that? Basically, two reasons: one, individual bodily autonomy means I get to decide what it is that I put into my body. Two, the notion of an individual knows what is best for that person and only when that is entirely clearly patently untrue can the government intervene. So for example, the government does not get to force me to go to the gym instead of going to work in the morning. The government does not get to force me to go home early from work to avoid stress. The government does not get to force me to not cram for tests the night before, even though it means I'll probably eat more pringles. All of these things are things that are sometimes right for the individual and therefore the government has to butt out of. This is the same. You have no right to take fast food away. Please oppose.
So I think that government sort of ignores the elephant in the room, and that is the strong link between immigration and trumpism, populism or xenophobia in general. Now we can argue about the contribution of immigration to the economy and so on and so forth but in our opinion, in today's political reality, immigration has turned into this hot potato that significance goes way beyond growth and employment. This speech is going to be dedicated to explain how immigration to the united states feeds into the sort of silent rage of many people and plays into the hands of dangerous populists. Note, all that we need to show is that immigration brings more bad than good. This means that unlike what side government is saying, we think that the net impact of immigration to the united states brings more negative results for the state. Now this does not necessarily mean that we are against immigration or that we wish to stop it seeing as, you know, utility to the state isn't necessarily the most important thing in the world, and there are also important moral arguments that we're not going to discuss in this debate. Just wanted to make that clear. So a few points of rebuttal. First, referring to all of the economic arguments about growth and potent employees that enter the state, now we don't necessarily agree that this this is the situation. There are plenty of immigrants that live in enclaves and, at best, work, you know, in the black, without paying taxes, because they fear that they will get caught and deported, and that is a burden on the economy. But again, we don't want to to dive too deep into that argument. We think that, if anything, we need to, you know, go up one level and ask is does this sort of macroeconomic policy of protectionism, which is a direct result of, among other things, excessive immigration, is that good or bad for the economy? And in our opinion, this will prove devastating in the long run. Referring to how immigration creates a cosmopolitan atmosphere and a cultural diversity, we think it's very easy for the previous speaker to talk about new york and los angeles, but you also have to look at what's happening in the at the rest like in the rest of the country, and there the diversity does not lead to this mutual acceptance, but rather forth it incites hatred and xenophobia. Okay, so on to the positive. There are a lot of attempts to explain the social and cultural and political factors that have led to the winning of donald trump in the presidency. One of the explanations that I find particularly convincing is that there are many people in what we call the flyover states or just, you know, from families that didn't get to to enjoy financial success, and that the american dream hasn't worked as well for them as they had expected. And they feel that they as if they've been standing in line for a very long time waiting to get to this promised success. And all of a sudden they see that a lot of people that got there after them get to skip them in line, meaning, of course, immigrants. This creates the sort of xenophobia and the desire to tear up the old institution that promoted others at your expense. And that is what trump recognized and gave a face to. We believe that trump and his populist movement are a colossal disaster for the united states economically speaking, militarily speaking, socially speaking, and in any other aspect. And we have to recognize that had it not been for the excessive immigration to the united states, he probably would not have been able to take over the presidency and therefore, we must admit that immigration to the united states has brought more harm than good.
Casinos are far from being perfect, but all of the current problems that exist in casinos are about to become far more severe in their absence. And that means that, all in all, casinos are a net good. Our argument is going to be fairly simple and it is about the black market that is created in the absence of casinos. But before that, two points of rebuttal. So, the first argument made by the previous speaker is about how casinos are, you know, programmed to squeeze as as much money out of people as possible. It's not just gambling we're being told because the expectancy of gains is always going to be negative. We say that we simply shouldn't look at casinos as an investment, but rather a fun activity that people like go out to casinos to have fun. The previous speaker himself said that casinos are a way for people to be entertained. We say that the people that go there and visit casinos more likely like they know that, more likely than not, they're going to lose money, but they are awarded with the feeling of, you know, thrill and, you know, expecting that maybe what if this time it's going to work. In this sense, we believe a casino is not much different from restaurants or movie theaters. These are all businesses that are meant to squeeze money out of customers, but the customer can choose whether he freely walks in there and pay, because he feels that it's worth his money. The second argument is about the crime that's associated with casinos like, you know, excessive drinking that leads to violence or DUIs. We say that that is also true to like just normal bars, right? And in addition, we hear that it attracts prostitution and drugs, and we're going to accept that this might be many times true to some degree. But we are going to argue that without casinos, all of these effects are going to become much more severe. So moving on to the constructive argument. I'm going to to quote once more what the prime the previous speaker said. He said that casinos are a manifestation of the worst impulses of people, and we don't necessarily disagree. But the thing about impulses is that it's very hard to fight them. If we try to simply repress them or ignore them, they tend to resurface and the harder we try, the more aggressively the outburst is. We argue that casinos, albeit not perfect, provide the most orderly outlet and the most controllable outlet for people who need things such as gambling and drinking and so on. We say that in places where there are no casinos, it's not that people just cease with all of these habits. They find them in the black market, in all like in shady rooms backstage of some club that is owned by some criminal organization and the like. These are places where the law isn't present. You know, casinos in las vegas maybe turn a blind eye to small like, you know, to to small violations, like prostitutions or drugs but these are still, all in all, you know, clean places. They are crowded places. It's not likely that you could just beat a person up to death without anybody noticing or knowing. But the same doesn't apply in the black market. There, people truly find themselves in crippling debts with a true life threat situation in like in situations where they cannot repay that debt. What like the black market gambling is what truly sucks people into the circle of crime. So for all of these reasons, we think that casinos bring more good than harm.
We should not fight nationalism. We think that in debates about nationalism, people often conflate nationalism with fascism, with racism, with other exclusionary behavior. But we think that, at its root, nationalism is a pride in where you come from, a close tie to your community and to the people within that community, and ultimately fosters a stronger identity of that aligns yourself with the utility of your nation and allows for a more productive society. The first argument that the government makes is about domestic harms. They say that people treat immigrants worse because they're viewed as the other, and then give the example of the US view on immigrants, with people like donald trump denouncing mexicans and muslims and all of these types of things. So, four responses. The first is that if you actually look at the comparative gains from nationalism, if you have a group that is a group of nationalist individuals or people that identify as nationalist, and they're more tied to their community, to their country, then we think that it outweighs the benefits to that group, if their point is true, outweighs the small the relatively small group of immigrants within that nation. But more importantly, we think that the view of the nation is fluid. Look at somewhere like the UK where the idea of their nation now involves things like a strong indian cuisine, or look at united states where everyone views themselves as an immigrant in one way or the other. We think that nationalism does not necessarily mean that other cultures are not welcome but rather it's an identity and a pride in your state. We also think that it's fine to give preference to your own citizens. We actually think that the government has a strong obligation to do so, because the government is the one that's citizens are the ones that are having their freedoms constrained, that are having their money taken from them in the form of taxation, and so a nationalist bent for the government, a government that is more concerned about protecting and helping its own citizens is probably a good thing. But finally, to address this argument about the US and how we treat immigrants, there's a difference between racism and nationalism. For donald trump to call mexicans racist is not nationalist, it's racist. To assume that all people who are muslim are terrorists is, again, not nationalist, it is racist. And we are fine on side opposition denouncing racism, even when it is tied to nationalistic fervor and nationalistic dialogue, but we do not think that racism is a necessary part of nationalism and because of that, we think nationalism by itself is just fine. The second argument they make under this is that you're more likely to exclude others if you're a nationalist. Again, maybe this is true, but we also think that you're more likely to care for those within your borders, which creates a net gain in utility. The final argument they make is that you can't criticize the government if you're a nationalist or you're less likely to do so, which is weird because they just used the example of the US as a highly nationalist state, but you also see that the approval ratings of the government, overall, on both sides of the aisle, are incredibly low. What we think nationalism means is that you have a high standard for your government and you want to hold it to that high standard, which is why in many places with nationalism on the rise, you see people disapproving of their government, not failing to criticize it. The last argument they make is about international harms, and essentially their argument boils down to if you're a nationalist, you're less likely to cooperate on the global level and that globalization will be hindered. But there's no getting off the globalization train. Our economies, our communities, our work forces are so interconnected on a global level, and the fact that those that are the most powerful, the wealthy in society, need things like trade and globalization in order to continue to build wealth, we think it's highly unlikely that, in a pragmatic sense, nationalism is ever going to hinder things like trade deals, things like international cooperation, and for these reasons, we should not fight nationalism.
We should not end the use of economic sanctions. So before we get into responding to the government side's arguments, we want to lay out why sanctions are good and when they are used. Because recognize that no matter what we do, whether we use economic sanctions or not, economic sanctions rise out of an international an an international community that itself is always going to be combative and is always going to be jostling between states for resources, for power, for any number of different things, and so negotiation or inter-state interaction is going to have to happen no matter what. And let's look historically at what has been done when these two states when two states or two or more states have conflict. Well, one, sometimes they go to war. We think that, clearly, economic sanctions are a preferable action to literally going to war and causing the deaths of just as many innocent civilians, as well as many, many more many, many more people that are in your army or in your navy or whatnot, and we think that war's just significantly more destructive for both parties than sanctions. But the other thing that people often do is they try to resolve their issues through diplomacy, through negotiation, through bartering. But, frankly, there are times in which diplomacy simply doesn't work if there is no teeth, if there's no backing to it. If your negotiations don't matter, you can never get other countries to stop their actions, because at the end of the day, you can't do anything to stop them. But that's where sanctions come in handy. Sanctions are a great middle ground between literally going to war and trying to negotiate but never getting anywhere. And we think that that's when sanctions are most used. Frankly, sanctions do instrumentalize people within the countries that are being sanctioned. It instrumentalizes them to act, to rise up, to have a lower quality of life, and then to go against their go against their leaders in order to make their suffering stop. But as a state, in a realist world, we think it's important that you fundamentally prioritize the benefits of your state and your citizens. And in these instances in which sanctions are being used, these are often instances where security of your citizens is at risk or the well-being of your citizens is at risk, and in those times, sanctions are a good way to address that harm while still doing less harm than you otherwise would if you went to war with that other country. So let's respond directly to the government's arguments. First, they say it's ineffective. If the goal is to force a country to change their behavior, dictatorial regimes just point to the west as a scapegoat, and they don't care about their populace so so at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. So, first, whether or not the dictator cares about their populace, the people care about their populace. And if many people are suffering and the dictator can't provide for those people, eventually that dictator is going to lose power, especially when it means that the sanctions not only affect the dictator, but the average person that is in that dictator's army, who is who is giving that dictator the ability to oppress its people. But additionally, scapegoating is working less and less in the time of the internet when information is more readily available worldwide. And, empirically, it has worked before. Look at how sanctions brought iran to the table to seriously negotiate about nuclear weapons and nuclear and their nuclear development program with the united states. So, the next argument they make is that this just hurts the worst off. First, in the long run, it can help the worst off if you get better regime or better action from the regime, but as I already stated, cross apply what I said, the state shouldn't care about foreign actors when it comes to the cost of their own citizens. Finally, it says it hurts the government says that it hurts the country that actually is putting the sanctions on another country because it lowers trade. Frankly, sanctions are only ever used in instances in which there's a power imbalance, because your sanctioning of that country does more harm to it than to you. So sanctions, honestly, for the most part, have a negligible impact on the economy, especially when the dynamic is one of the united states versus iran, which is more common than iran versus iraq. For these reasons, we should not end the use of economic sanctions.
We should not fight global warming. To say that we should not fight global warming is not to say that we don't acknowledge the many many problems that are going to arise from global warming. On side opposition we're not science deniers. Rather we take a more realistic view of the world that we currently live in and the science as it stands than side government and we're going to explain why instead of fighting global warming we need to invest as many resources as we can in planning for the inevitable doom that will come because of global warming. The first argument that the government side makes is that climate change is going to lead to massive harms like the fact that the entire nation of bangladesh will likely be underwater, that new york city will be under water, that countries large and small are going to be affected in myriad ways. We believe that this is true but it is also irreversible at this point. There are essentially two views on global warming and the outcomes that will occur: one view is that we are past the tipping point. That global sea levels are going to rise no matter what actions we take, that the earth will warm by four degrees celsius over the next one hundred years and that the polar ice caps are essentially going to entirely melt. If this is the case, then there's no action that we can take right now to change the events that are going to come. There's no way, with enough carbon emission carbon emissions deductions, or anything of that sort, that we are going to change those outcomes. And given that that is highly probable that we are doomed anyway we need to put every resource we can not into global warming prevention, but global warming preparation. The other outlook is that well, maybe global warming isn't isn't irreversible at this point. Maybe we can still prevent the worst possible outcomes but this, all scientists that believe this agree that we would need to change our activity to such a dramatic degree that it is highly unlikely that developed and developing nations could ever come together in a way that would make this feasible. Carbon emissions will need to be cut by fifty percent or greater in order for us to actually stand a chance of preventing the outcomes of global warming, which we think side government has done nothing to show is at all feasible, which again means we think we need to shift resources any resources that are available, any resources that we could've poured into global warming, fighting global warming, into global warming prevention. The second argument they make is about economic doom and saying that global warming is going to devastate food production, and things like the great plains are going to become unplantable and china is going to become entirely desert, again, exactly. These are the problems that global warming is going to cause and no change to the level of carbon emissions that we make are going to prevent these outcomes from happening. Now side government might say something like: " well, hold on we can also invest in things that remove carbon from the atmosphere. " But that's a moon shot. This is something that people been working on for two decades now and it still hasn't it hasn't produced any fruitful yields. Given even if we were, in ten fifteen twenty years, able to find something that could do some sort of carbon removal from the atmosphere, we don't think that it would be enough by that point to actually prevent the worst outcomes which means again we need to focus on on protection. Finally they say that the outcomes are unpredictable and that things could happen like the shift in the gulf stream. So while it's true that some outcomes are unpredictable many of our models allow us to know the likely outcomes that are going to occur such as rising sea levels and how that's going to shift where land is in the world. And even if you can't predict it we are we are almost certainly past the tipping point, which means that we should use all of the knowledge we have to plan as best we can. Maybe it won't be a hundred percent successful but given the horrible situation we're in we need to do everything we can. For these reasons we should not fight global warming.
We should not end progressive taxation. So before we get into the round and respond to some of the government's arguments, we wanna actually just point something out that's very clear, which is that our side is defending the status quo. Our side is saying that the system of taxation that we have now, the current sets of motivating factors that exist in the status quo are what we are defending and so, when the government makes claims that we're going to get to later about the pragmatic harms of progressive taxation, we think it's important to keep in mind that, in the status quo, we don't have a system in which there is immense warfare between classes, there's not a system in which people aren't driven to go on and get better jobs, in which people don't try and still improve the economy, and we're not living in a society in which the economy is flatline. Given that these things are the case, we think, from a pragmatic standpoint, progressive taxation does not really, as a status quo, is not a system that has caused an immense amount of the harms that the government side projects and therefore, we think, they cannot win this debate on the pragmatic terms. But let's get into some of the positive pragmatic arguments for our side as well as the principled. So we have a number of reasons why we think that progressive taxation is the most fair way of having a distributive tax burden. Because recognize that the government side also doesn't argue for the equality of everyone paying the same share of taxes. They're not saying that all people should pay the exact same fee, even though if you look in a in absolute terms, if everyone is getting, from their perspective, if everyone is getting the same sort of benefit, if everyone is getting the same sort of benefit from the state, which is what the government side would argue in this round and has argued, we think then it wouldn't be fair for millionaires to pay millions of dollars more than people that have a thousand dollars in the bank, because they're each getting the same benefit. And, therefore, we think, based on all of the government's arguments, what they're actually saying is that there should be some sort of equality of burden. But if you're going to argue for equality of burden, it's important to recognize that one dollar to someone that is incredibly well-off does not mean the same to someone who is not well-off, and we think that progressive taxation best captures this model of reality in which people recognize that you can put a higher burden on someone who is in the ninetieth percentile of income. You can put a much higher burden, a percentage that you take away from them, than you can for someone in lower economic classes, and their life is not going to be harmed in a demonstrably in a demonstrable way. We think most of the time, these people are going to be able to live essentially the same quality of life and, therefore, if you want a quality of burden, which we think is clearly what the other side is after when they're arguing principally that you should take from all people equally, and that this means that you should take the same percentage rather than the same absolute amount, we think that we just better hit the same target that the government side sets out. We also think it's fair to point out that the rich get a lot more from the state. The state sets up economic apparatuses that then the rich are able to benefit off of. But lets then, quickly, respond to the principled argument that the government makes, which is that people have the right to property that they derived through their labor and therefore, if all taxes are theft, you need to steal equally from all people. First, we explain why their principal their principled argument would instead lead them to a system that they are not endorsing, one of absolute absolute tax payments from all people, but it's important to point out two things. First, the state makes all of these things possible. The entire economic system in which your labor can exist is only possible within the state apparatus and, therefore, you owe the state for any sort of property that you're able to accumulate. And secondly, in reality, effort and labor have little correlation with wealth and income. There are people that work incredibly hard day in, day out, in incredibly menial belabor-intensive jobs that will never even come close to making the same amount as someone like jeff bezos will in a single second. For these reasons, we should not end progressive taxation.
We should not limit the use of birth control for people under eighteen as rachel tells you. On our side we're going to explain to you why this is a violation of individual choice, why minors in particular need to have their access to birth control protected, and lastly why there's a public interest in making birth control available to women under the age of eighteen. So first: why do we care about individual choice? I'd like to begin by pointing out here that different people have different capacities at different ages. There has to be some cutoff for adulthood so we've chosen eighteen as when people are able to vote and join the military and things like that, but the fact remains that some seventeen year olds are more mature than some eighteen year olds. We think at the end of the day that given that we acknowledge a principle in western society that people should be able to make their own decisions, that it's unfair to discriminate against people who are under the age of eighteen as unable to know their own preferences and make decisions based on them. We're fine saying on our side that there should be some sort of consultation. We would still require a prescription for types of birth control that require a prescription in the status quo, but we think that at the end of the day a sixteen year old is still able to know their own preferences. And if they know that they're having unprotected sex or if they know that they don't want to have their period, we think that they have no less ability to know what they want than an eighteen year old. We think therefore that this is arbitrarily limiting this principle of individual choice that underlines the ideas of liberal democracy. Therefore we don't think we should limit birth control. We think that we should make sure that young people are educated and are talking to a doctor when they make decisions about their health, but frankly we do the same thing for eighteen and nineteen year olds. So I think that having this bright line that rachel's established at age eighteen is unreasonable. Our second argument is that minors in particular need access to birth control because they have fewer options that they can make about their own health and well being. The first thing I'd like to point out here is that it's unreasonable to assume that people under eighteen don't or shouldn't have sex. About half of all american teens over the age of seventeen have had sex. What that tells us is that millions of teenagers in the united states are having sex before they turn eighteen and before they finish high school. So it would be unrealistic to assume that this would change since even before birth control was invented there was probably still a similar statistic. We think that because minors aren't able to access abortion and also generally aren't going to be able to raise these children successfully that they just have many fewer options if they should accidentally get pregnant. We think therefore that it's especially important to help minors avoid unwanted pregnancies, in particular since an unwanted pregnancy at a young age can prevent people from finishing their education and therefore from getting a good job later in life which really can undermine the whole trajectory of their career. And our final argument is that there's a clear public interest in preventing teen pregnancy. Teen pregnancies tend to lead to babies being put up for adoption or into foster care or to people being taken out of the work force or going into the workforce at a much lower level than they would otherwise. In addition many teen pregnancies have complications compared to pregnancies at a later age. So we can see that there's a compelling public interest in letting young women avoid unwanted pregnancies and as a result clearly we need to make birth control available. You can't stop people from having sex so you need to facilitate their ability to do so responsibly. And part of that means letting young women choose to take birth control even if they have religious parents who won't approve it or even if they're in a community that doesn't want young people to have sex. For all of these reasons we should not limit birth control to women over age eighteen. Thank you.
We should not ban genetically modified crops. We're going to present two arguments for our side today. The first is about food production, and the second is about the anti-science bias and why this doesn't even really make sense. So, first, how do genetically modified crops affect food production? One of the most important events of the twentieth century was the so-called green revolution. This was a transition away from using the old heritage crops, the strains of rice and wheat that were developed in the nineteenth century, note not for thousands of years, developed in the nineteenth century, in favor of new twentieth century crops that were drought and poor weather-resistant. The most famous of this is called dwarf wheat. It's a type of wheat that needs less space, less sunlight, and provides about twice as much food as the types of wheat that were in use before the nineteen sixties. If you've ever asked yourself why did famines go from being an everyday part of life in the developing world to essentially unheard of in the twentieth century, one of the biggest reasons is that food production skyrocketed due to genetically modified organisms such as dwarf wheat. Food production astronomically increased per capita in many countries, like mexico, where previously people struggled to produce enough food to meet their needs and for export. So even if there are some harms to genetically modified crops, even if the behaviors of companies like monsanto are really bad, as rachel tells you, we think that the benefit of allowing millions of people to grow enough food to, essentially, ensure that they continue to live and making, essentially, every country in the world food secure is worthwhile, and that they would have to show much larger harms than a few lawsuits in order to justify getting rid of the only reason that there isn't massive famine in countries like india or across sub-saharan africa today. And just in response to what rachel tells you about patents, she says that these companies abuse their patents to make money, but we tell you that the only incentive for innovation and the development of new strains of different plants or new breeds of animals is the knowledge that you'll be able to recoup your costs. If farmers can buy one bag of your corn and then reseed their entire field with it the next year, then you're never going to make back the huge investment for research and development that goes into these crops. So we think because these are absolutely beneficial for humanity and because they're expensive to develop that it's acceptable for these companies to make a profit. Perhaps they should have to go generic the way drugs do after a couple of decades, but we think that allowing patents, in principle, is still justifiable and that all of the harms rachel tells you are really marginal compared to the massive benefits for the populations of poor countries. Our second argument is about why it's arbitrary to go after GMOs. First, what is a genetically modified crop? If you've ever seen a wild banana, maybe you've seen a picture online, they look nothing like the bananas we buy in the store. Why? Bananas are a genetically modified organism. They were bred into existence by native american peoples. Similarly, corn or maize, if you prefer, doesn't really exist in its current form in the wild. It's been bred into the familiar yellow plant we know today from a plant that is different colors and has hardly any kernels compared to modern corn. It's essentially just the fact that these are spooky and new that makes people want to ban them. There's no risk to getting more wheat off of a single stalk. There's no harm to having more corn on every acre of land, especially since today we're just using technology to do more quickly what people used to have to do over the course of decades. So for all of these reasons, we should certainly not ban genetically modified crops. Thank you.
Two points in support of alternative medicine. One, on why we have reason to believe that alternative medicine, despite not passing scientific test, is none the less effective. Two, on why we have reason to believe that even if it isn't effective, it's still helpful to the people who take it. Two point of clarity and then two points of refutation. One, on what we believe. They talk about harmful alternative medicine. We don't have to support every form of alternative medicine. As far as we're concerned, we support alternative medicine that is as helpful as a sugar pill, placebo pill, and not any form of alternative medicine that does active harm to people making them worse. We support regulation on alternative medicine, so for example if I want to treat you with alternative medicine I need to see a note from your doctor that says he's aware of the fact that you're coming to be treated here, and he's aware of whatever treatments it is that you're taking so that it interacts okay with medicine we're fine with all those things, we simply don't think you should ban it entirely in every version of it. Secondly, you need to recognize who the types of people who use alternative medicine are. Almost nobody believes that alternative medicine is better than regular medicine. In fact, it seen as supplementary. Generally, when people turn to alternative medicine, it's almost always because they've been failed by regular medicine. This means that it's people who are suffering all of the time and don't have another way to improve their lives. That's crucial to understand the types of damages versus benefits that you can accrue from alternative medicine. Two points of refutation. One, they say " we'll ban what harmful ". Note we don't need to discuss what harmful, we need to discuss what is unhelpful. Those are two different distinctions. The government does not have the right to ban you from studying philosophy simply because it's unhelpful to you. Two, he says " the research costs money, and that's a waste ". This is literally a ridiculous argument. Why? Because it's not categorized as alternative medicine until the point where it's researched and disproven. It is it is experimental medicine as is any drug until the point where it go through clinical study. So you absolutely can't save on that money. Otherwise, they're literally just banning the discovery of new, potentially life saving treatments. First argument. Why do we have reason to believe it works even when it's not proven. The cost of things like acupuncture are marginal. What does that mean? That means that if anyone ever proves that acupuncture is as helpful as ibuprofen, that is a massive financial harm to big pharma companies. What does that mean? That means that enormous lobbying power goes into making sure that alternative forms of medicine, IE medicine that is not based in specifically chemicals going into your body, and note that this often includes things like marijuana for example, which is not a chemical but something that is easily found in nature and therefore not patentable, that they fail these tests. Now, sure, you'll say it's hard to rig these tests. We say that may be true, but it's certainly possible. It is possible enough for us to have plausible reason to believe that some of these forms of alternative medicine are actually helpful, but nobody has the financial interest to to work them out and prove them because it costs so much money to do so and because you can't make a profit off of proving them because you can't patent these things, and you do have massive financial interest in shutting down any study that exists on it. That means it's less likely to go through trials and less likely to be proven as effective. The second thing we want to discuss is that it helps even if it doesn't help. What does that mean? Just the joy or the placebo effect of believing you're going to get better and getting better based on that is better than nothing. Given the people who often turn to alternative medicine are people who before alternative medicine have a zero chance of success with regular medicine, we think that giving them hope is better, both because they could have the placebo effect an, and because even if it doesn't, it at the very least least adds joy and hope to their lives during the ends of their lives. For these reasons, we beg you to support alternative medicine. Oppose the motion.
I stand in firm opposition to the motion we should increase reforestation. Now reforestation might be an intuitive good. Many people think that more trees is always better but I really want to dissect what this motion is saying before I get on to the actual arguments I want to provide. Recognize that we are increasing reforestation as a result of this policy. We already see that in most states any logging company that cuts down a tree has to plant two trees in its place. Ultimately, increasing reforestation be massive increase in the total amount of vegetation and leafy growth in forests around the world. This is incredibly problematic for two reasons. First is forest fires. Forest fires are incredibly problematic because we think that as there is more vegetation, the chance of a forest fire increases. Now what we see is in areas like california and oregon. In the desert you don't get forest fires. It's really hot, there are still some trees but the trees are on average about eight feet away from one another and as such, if one catches fire it's unlikely it'll spread to the next. But go to a far less hot part of the country, go to northern oregon and you see that the trees are all packed together. Even though it doesn't get incredibly hot, a single fire can spread throughout the entire forest destroying the entire forest as well as any neighboring cities. This is incredibly problematic for a few reasons. First we think increased vegetation means that the forest file fire will burn longer and be harder to put out for firefighters. This first puts firefighters' lives at risk which we think is unacceptable. There should not be a government policy which puts some of the bravest people in are society into harm's way. But secondly, we think that this increases the total amount of smoke that you see in the cities around them. This summer we saw that seattle had worse air quality in beijing. A city that's known for giving people asthma, giving people birth defects due to the total amount of smog in the air. We think a prolonged period of smog would lead to incredibly detrimental health effects. The second big problem is just bigger forest fires. As fires get bigger they can spread further. Now instead of having localized fires in the northwest, you're likely to see fires spread farther east and all the way to the coast ultimately destroying the heavily populated cities that we see on the coast such as LA, san francisco and portland. Ultimately, if we were to increase the total amount of reforestation, the result would be a considerably more harmed human populace in any area that has trees. Now my opponent might counter this by saying that the environment is more important but we don't think it really is. Reforestation is not the golden ticket to resolve global warming and as such, she can't claim the lives that she might try to protect as a result of reforestation. But secondly, we think that this is just a form of false solvency. To truly get rehabilitation of our environment we need to drastically reform how our capital system works and how corporations engage with the environment as a whole. We need to put in fee structures in ways that we can penalize corporations for destroying natural areas. Increase in the total amount of trees really is not a solution. It just makes it so there's more forest fires and lumber companies can get a little bit more profit. My second argument is about cost though. We think that reforestation is will come at a very heavy cost insofar as we are already pushing reforestation to the extreme. So were we to increase it we think that the additional dollars would go less far. That is to say, if we want to increase reforestation we'll have to spend more money will have to ship even more seed. We'll have to train even more people they'll have to take even more time to plant these trees. This increases the cost of paper. This increases the cost of all wooden goods and ultimately, is just bad for our economy. For this reason, we should not increase reforestation.
Two arguments in opposition of subsidizing electric cars: one, electric cars don't actually save on greenhouse gas emissions or help the environment. They simply move the negative effects of these things to other poorer areas who suffer more. Two, there is a counternarrative to subsidizing electric cars and that is subsidizing proper public transportation. We think this money is exchangeable because there is limited ability to spend government funding on transportation and limited political capital for doing so. These come at the expense of one another and we'd prefer to spend it on public transportation. Two points of rebuttal: one, yaar says there's problems today such as fuel crisis pollution and oil dependency. We agree with all of these problems. We don't agree that electric cars solve any of them. Crucially, yaar gives you no reason to believe that they do. He simply asserts it. Two, yaar says there's a strong lobby and that strong lobby is preventing lawmakers from creating infrastructure which is necessary for the usability of electric cars. Three responses to this: a, there is no need for government controlled infrastructure electric cars drive on the same roads. They pull over for the same amount of time. The only thing you need is private gas stations to purchase private land or indeed maintain the private land that they already own and put a charging station in it. That is not an infrastructure issue, that is a company's business interest. Secondly, public support ought balance this out. If electric cars are as great as yaar thinks and many of the population seem to think they're that great, then you get credit back, you get public support which at least balances out some lobbies thinking that you're hurting them. Thirdly, if yaar's right and policy makers are preventing infrastructure that is necessary, we're unsure how any of this gets solved. Presumably, you cannot call paying off policy makers a subsidy. No matter how cheap the car becomes after your subsidy, if you have nowhere to gas it up or no way to drive it and it's an useless car, you're still not gonna buy it, which means if that's the problem with the market, subsidies don't solve it in any way. One, why don't we actually save on greenhouse gas emissions? So, first off, the electricity used is often produced by coal, for example, which is just as harmful for the environment. Crucially, the coal production is all more localized than cars going around, which means that the negative impacts of its production are even worse because they're all attacking in the same place. Secondly, creation of the battery itself takes an enormous amount of energy which is just as pollutant. The only difference is that's done far away where poor people live and can't control it as much, as opposed to in my backyard. The only thing this policy does is move the detrimental effects of climate change from everyone's burden to poor people's burden. We think that's negative. Secondly, we think all of yaar's problems are solved better by public transportation. Public transportation can remove oil dependency, it can create substantially less pollution, and it can avert the fuel crisis, particularly if you're talking about electric public transportation. Crucially, it, more so than anything else, requires the infrastructure being blocked by the lobbies that yaar talks about and requires the intervention of subsidies in order to be created. We think public transportation solves all of yaar's problems substantially better. We think yaar's problems don't get solved by his solution. We beg you to oppose.
We should not end the use of economic sanctions. In this round we think it's important to recognize that just because sanctions are not used in all instances, just because the implementation of them could be better doesn't mean that they aren't a useful tool on the international stage in order to force change on murderous regimes. So the I think the overall point of the government's side in this round especially through the extended illustration of the oil for food program with iraq is that dictators simply do not care about their people and are willing to go to extreme lengths in order to get what they want and to and to avoid the harms of sanctions on them. But we think that recognize that the international realm has few abilities. There's few actions you can take realistically in order to force change in regimes where change needs to be needs to happen in order for the long term good of the people to be to win out. Given that this is the case, we think that economic sanctions are preferable to the realistic alternative such as just negotiating with no weight behind it, which we don't think will ever be effective in creating change, or full out strikes on the country whether it's war or whether it's small scale skirmishes which often harm people, harm bystanders at a similar if not greater level than sanctions while forcing the country to put their own citizens at risks. The first argument that they make is that sanctions instrumentalize foreign people essentially by harming them as much as possible so that they rise up and go against their regime. But there's a couple of other things that sanctions do that we think is important. First, it weakens the ability for the regime to fight against an opposition that already exists. If you put sanctions on a regime that doesn't allow them to get weapons imported, that doesn't allow them to get technology imported, that doesn't allow them to fuel up essentially to fight in opposition that usually already exists to a great degree, then we think that you also help that opposition in the long run. Additionally, almost every law that you can really think of instrumentalizes people. Every law that exists is a way of of insuring that people do not do something or do something in order to achieve a better end in the long run and whether that instrumentalization comes in the form of stopping people from using their property in the way they want or or harming them outright, we think that all law forces instrumentalization. So this principled claim that the government makes that instrumentalizing people is always wrong, we think is incorrect. In the long term, if this causes people to rise up, if it forces a regime change even if some people die in the short run, people are going to die under these regimes anyway. So we think that in the long run you can save more lives by forcing that regime out. The next argument they make is that elite targeting sanctions are ineffective. We do think that these sanctions can be effective when they're used along with other forces with other forms of international action. If you're cutting off access to banks bank accounts or luxury goods or the ability to travel, all of these things can chip away at a regime's worst actions and force them to make some sort of changes. So and even if they are ineffective, they're still fine to do because these types of sanctions are never going to harm are are never going to harm the people on the ground. So even if it's just a nuisance to dictators, we think that's better than taking no action at all. The final argument that they make is that sanctions are used in arbitrary instances and that we target venezuela but not china even though china has more of a human rights abuse history than venezuela. Regardless of whether we're targeting the worst people, we are still targeting instances in which bad actions are are occurring and are being done by leadership and we think acting in those instances is positive. Whether or not we should use this in more instances is up for debate but whether or not the instances we're using it in are just, we think is clear. For these reasons, we should not end the use of economic sanctions.
National sentiment has definitely brought a lot of bad but also a lot of good. We think that the only way to really weigh between the two things is to imagine a world without nationalism and ask whether on the comparative we would have gotten a better world. We will show in this speech that the current world in which many people give priority to the national element of their identity is preferable to the alternatives. We don't we do not think that we have gotten such a decent account of the effects of nationalism from side government. They chose to focus on the negative things alone and didn't bother to offer any alternatives. Let's refute what they did say. So they start by saying that nationalism is divisive and it creates competition and hatred between nations but we say that any other part of our identity that we would have chosen to prioritize would have the exact same effect. Identity is something that's compiled of things that make me special special when when comparing to others. This is by definition what identity means, therefore it is is it is divisive by nature. So even if I would have chosen for instance to prioritize my religion or my ethnicity or my ideology it wouldn't have mattered. Said next they talk about how nationalism leads to conflicts like the world war one example. So we don't think that it would be fair to say that all of these wars were a direct result of nationalism because reality is much more complex. There are there's a variety of different reasons and factors that lead to the outbreak of war such as financial considerations, and strategic, and military or political considerations, and it's quite presumptuous to reduce it all to nationalism. Next they say that rebellions that were caused by nationalism has has led to a lot of death. Well yeah but aren't we forgetting something? What about the freedom and independence that would never have would have happened without national rebellions like for instance the american revolution? It seems that side government has completely forgot that without nationalistic sentiment we would not have received the current like global order of nation states that has made the global system the most stable that it's ever been. Then they say that that like nationality is a an exclusive criterion that you cannot opt out or in of and that it leads to suspicion of whoever isn't part of your nation. You know with the jewish example and we think that this is a quite a strong argument. However, we do not see any alternatives that will lead to a better outcome. They talk about how there's no overlap between countries and and nations and how this creates minorities that suffer from discrimination because of nationalism and again we think that this would have been true to any alternative that is plausible. So what we come up and say is that basically people have an innate need to create groups of collective identification and the only way to do so in large numbers is to gather people around a a certain identical element. Had it not had it not been nationality it would have been religion or ethnicity or ideology. We say that people from different nations and different like people do cooperate more and more today and all of this violence that can result from nationalism isn't necessary. It's not it doesn't logically follow from nationalism necessarily. As for religion and ethnicity these are things that suffer from the exact same problems of exclusivity of lack of of overlap with with countries and they've also contributed to numerous deaths and misery and conflicts. Ideology has different problems. It's usually far less forgiving and far less patient towards anyone that doesn't share it. Communism would be a pretty good example of that. So we say but it's true that nationalism isn't perfect but given that it answers a very basic human need, and in light of the other alternatives identity that's based on nationality allows for the maximum amount of openness and receiving whoever is different from you and therefore we call you to oppose.
Don't end mandatory retirement. First, to make it very clear, our side of the house isn't against things like raising the retirement age to mitigate a lot of danny's harms. Like we think that if there are people who are still willing to work by the time that they are sixty five, the answer to this should be raising the retirement age to something like seventy so that people aren't forced into retirement at an early age or doing something like like a difference between the optional retirement age versus a mandatory retirement age that might come later. Like we think the problem here is that danny just doesn't address what happens when this is a majority positive policy. The fact that we can legislate around the minority situations where maybe this is implemented poorly or maybe people are really truly outliers, this kind of policy means that we should still have a mandatory retirement age. But also, we think there are a lot of sectors that usually take individuals who are retired. Like if you're someone who truly just doesn't want to not work, like you're so bored when you're retired, or it's like really bad for your mental health, you can be something like a librarian, or a security guard, or work as hospital greeting stuff. Like these are often jobs that are specifically set aside for individuals who are past the retirement age, and we don't think that the point of the mandatory retirement age is to block people out from working entirely, rather it's to shift them to at least less intensive sectors so that you can have a lot of the positive impacts we're going to talk about later on. Two main arguments: first, on making sure that youth have jobs. Sure, it sucks that sometimes people are forced into retirement before they are ready, but this reflects the weighing of a more important need of society. Young people are more central to the functioning of society and societal economy and those larger economic systems than older people, first, because there are a lot more economic safety nets in place for those who are older. Things like social security and medicare are perfect example of things that older people will have access to when forced into retirement, but young people struggle for a struggling for a job simply don't. So what this means is that the harms on someone who is older who is out of a job will always be less than the harms on someone who's younger and struggling to find a job and, reflexively, the harms to the economy are different. Because if I am an older person forced into retirement, sure, maybe it's hard to live on my social security payment, but it's still very likely that I will be able to do things like afford basic housing and basic needs or, at least, afford the majority of them such that I can find other things to fill in what's left over. But if I am younger and I don't have those social safety nets, then I will simply not be able to afford anything. I will have to do things like rely on welfare, which weakens the system in other spaces. Maybe I'll have to move back in with my parents. And these are things that are, on net, a lot worse for the economy than simply someone who's older having slightly less money. Moreover, a lot of older people have younger family members who can sustain them in a way that younger individuals don't have, if they struggle. We live in a time where the job market generally is pretty slim and we need to prioritize making sure that the younger population is getting jobs. And when you have old people who are significantly past the optional retirement age keeping those jobs, you prevent them from being available or competed for. This is especially since young people keep the economy sphere going in other ways. They're the ones who continue to contribute to social security and have more years to do that. We rely on them to have the next generation of children, which happens more safely if they have a job. Our second argument is about keeping systems efficient. There's a point where any old person, even the one in the best mental and physical shape that danny wants to talk about, is going to be worse at their job than a younger one. And this might have nothing to do with them and everything to do with the fact that technology is changing, rules are changing, and the language that you use for these kinds of things is changing. And although someone older might be able to keep up with it reasonably, it will be objectively less efficient than someone younger. We need to give companies a way to cycle into that more efficient state. Without mandatory retirement, it can be really hard to get rid of older people, even when they aren't even when they are underperforming. The problem here is that they can do things like sue you for being discriminatory against their age, but also because they're often socially and economically entrenched within that job so it's harder to get rid of them. Proud to oppose.
As far as we are concerned we need to separate between two things here. The first is the government's position that it's okay to force organ donations from living people. We find that quite simply insane. The second is the position that it's okay for the government to take organs from people post mortem. We find that a more interesting position but we're going to show why this is unjustified as well. Let's start from the first thing. So the logic of the government here is utilitarian logic at its purest form. Seeing as the sick person has more utility to gain from your kidney than you do, and his benefit outweighs your harm, then he should have the claims for it and you don't have a say in the matter. That that is the ethical thing to do. Here are a few problems that arise from this line of thinking. A, let's conjure up the next thought experiment: five dying people are lying at the hospital. The first awaits a heart transplant, the second a lung transplant, the third needs pancreas donation, the third needs kidney donation and the fifty needs a liver donation. All of them will surely die unless they are getting their transplant in the upcoming days but there are no donors in sight. According to the logic of side government it seems that it would be legitimate to just come up to a healthy innocent man, kill him and then transplant his organs in all of the five dying people. It cost us one life, but hey we were able to save five. Utilitarians would have to agree, right? I hope that everyone understands that this logic is making cold blooded murder justified. Second problem, what happens if a person isn't too worried about his own health? He smokes heavily for years, he eats unhealthy food, he drinks a lot of alcohol and he doesn't exercise and therefore at the age of fifty he needs a liver transplant. As it happens I, who do take care of myself and stay in shape and refrain from unhealthy stuff, was found suitable to be a donor. Even if as far as utility goes, he has more to gain from my liver right now, why should I be responsible and suffer the consequences for his like disregard for his own health? Third thing that we can say that arises from it, is that we can actually say that this policy endorses careless lifestyles exactly because the cost of living recklessly falls on someone else's head. Fourth thing is we can't help but wonder, what about money? How is it that our utilitarian proposition don't have anything to say on whether it's legitimate to take from wealthy citizens most of their life savings in order to help people without money? If they are for it, guess what, it's called communism, it's been tried before and it doesn't work so well. Now let's move on to discuss what's so horrible about forcing people to donate organs after their deaths. Here without a doubt the utilitarian argument becomes more challenging because then people truly don't have interests that we can harm. As we are very much like we as we very much endorse people to sign declarations and enter donors lists we still say that it is it is unjustified to force this upon everybody. Why? A, too many many people especially in religious communities, the idea of maintaining their body integrity is fundamental to the way they see the world. These people believe that such procedures are wrongful intervention in god's plans and that if their donor if their organs are going to be removed from their bodies, even if it is done after their deaths, they can spend forever in hell. If like telling them what what do you care you'll no longer be alive, it doesn't stick here because what happens in the afterlife is the entire point. To these people knowing that they will reach heaven means more to them than any other thing that happens to them in this lifetime. They are sometimes even willing to die for their beliefs. Knowing that there's a chance that their organs are going to be removed means a lifetime of agony to these people, to millions of people. An agony that, as far as they're concerned, is worse than death itself. Second thing to say here is that we think that families are a valid consideration. It is incredibly cruel to come up to a mother that's just lost her son and is forced to go through the entire pain of having to bury him and demand that she allow for her son's body, which is all she has left of him, to be used as a tool box. For all of these reasons please oppose this motion.
Two things we're going to talk to you about today. One, on how it is the act of choice and the ability to choose that makes a human being a human being, and how that affects both the side of the fetus and the side of the mother mother. Two, on comparative rights between a fetus and its mother. Before that, two points of extraneous rebuttal. One, daniel tells us abortion is a choice which can't be balanced against entire human life not being experienced. Three responses: one, note daniel assumes a fetus is a human life. That's not an assumption we're willing to accept. That's not an assumption that any reasonable supporter of abortion is willing to accept, and we're not entirely sure why daniel spends no time explaining how a fetus is equivalent to an actual human being. Two, if life potential is the criteria because a fetus can become a human being, we're a little confused by daniel supporting giving away condoms. Everyone of those sperm has the potential to one day be life and yet daniel is perfectly fine with killing those off. What then is the difference, and where does he draw the line? Three, a human life is defined by the choices that the individual can make. Having a baby may be a choice for some people, but it is one that removes infinite potential choices in the future, because the care and attention you need to give that baby just to keep it safe, not even to do a good job raising it, is so great that your life becomes substantially more limited. So it's not life versus. It's a life versus a life. Two, daniel says when we're not really sure, we need to defer against harm. Note this begs the question and assumes that the harm to the fetus is greater. We say that ruining a current life and ruining the potential life of the fetus given it's going to be raised by a parent who never wanted it in the first place versus removing what is essentially the cellular equivalent of a malignant tumor is probably more harmful on our side of the house. Now let's talk about why you become an entity through choice. When questioning what is a human being, what you need to ask is what is it that makes human beings different from other entities in the world, different from animals, different from trees, different from rocks. We say it is the act and ability to choose, to decide rationally for yourself or to some minimal extent rationally for yourself, how it is that you intend on acting next, how you intend on taking things, etcetera. Note this active choice exists in every single human being. Even from a baby, they have some acts of choice. You have some acts of choice even with mentally disabled people. They're all able to, in some cognizant sense, make deliberate choices. A fetus isn't able to do this. Two things this means to you: one, a fetus is not at the point where he is a human where it is a human being. It therefore does not grant it rights. Two, a fetus becoming a baby removes, as we already said, multiple choices from this mother. That means its existence makes the mother less of a human being. It's a double-sided coin. What does that mean about comparative rights? Note daniel himself says if it risks the health of the mother or if it's rape or if it is against the health of a child, we're okay with it. What does this mean? He's willing to accept that certain damages to the mother or to the child are sufficient to take away what he calls life. If he truly believed it was life, obviously health risks would not be sufficient to take it away. Clearly, he himself doesn't think it's an actual life. Furthermore, at the point where it's a non-entity threatening to ruin the life of an actual mother, we say the harms fall strongly on our side and we beg you to allow abortion.
We should not legalize public nudity. On our side, we're going to explain why we think that, in most areas, public nudity is inappropriate and why countries, where it's not presently legal, should not legalize that practice. Some rebuttal to the arguments we heard from sam will be integrated. Our first argument is, quite simply, that this makes some people uncomfortable. Sam portrays this is an issue of positive freedom, one's right to be nude in a public space, but we would argue that this contrasts with the negative freedom of people to be free from nudity that might be offensive or discomforting to them in the public sphere. Why is this negative freedom more important than the sort of positive freedom sam tells you about? We would argue, first, that there are many legitimate reasons why someone might be uncomfortable with public nudity. Many religions, for instance, not only prohibit public nudity, but would also make it very difficult for people to be in a space with people of the opposite sex who are naked. So, for instance, if you have naked men on the paris metro, that only makes it a more hostile environment for muslim women in particular. And aside from religious bias, we also think that many people who have been victims of assault who've who have had a bad experience with someone of a different sex might be very uncomfortable with seeing people of that sex out in public, naked. We think that this can serve to make many spaces closed off to these people who have been victims of assault so that they'll be even less likely to use services like the metro that, in theory, ought be open to everyone. And we think that because, really, there's no harm to having to wear clothes, despite what sam tells you about the homeless, more on that later, and there is a harm to being exposed to this nudity that, quite clearly, we should defer to protecting people and their negative rights as opposed to the positive right sam tells you about. Our second argument is that this enforces a kind of public morality. If there are people who think that public nudity is unacceptable or that people should be modest, this is tantamount to the government telling those people: your way of life is wrong, we shouldn't do this, we should let people do whatever they want. Now the other side might say that you're doing the same thing enforcing a public morality by banning public nudity but given that that's the status quo, I think it's much less of a statement by the government than the legalization of public nudity would be and, therefore, that that's less of an issue in that case. Our final argument is that nobody needs public nudity, right? This is a solution to an imaginary problem, and it creates lots of issues for absolutely no reason. The only example sam gives you of someone who might need to be nude in public is a homeless person who needs to change their clothes. But given that homeless people also have to go indoors to use the restroom, have to go into private places to have sex and things like that, we think that there absolutely are opportunities for people to go into a private space. And for sam to claim that the only way people can change their clothes is to be completely naked in public just doesn't hold true. I think that for most of us who live in cities that aren't san francisco, it's quite rare to see naked homeless people, yet presumably these people change their clothes occasionally. So there are solutions to this problem. And if the only circumstance in which someone could change their clothes was in a public place, we think that that person is probably in a situation where they need the authorities to intervene and help them because, clearly, that person isn't in a position where they can fully take care of themselves. We recognize that sometimes the authorities being involved can be violent and that's unfortunate, but the alternative of letting that person pose a threat or make other people feel unsafe is not acceptable. Even if some people would suffer from this, which we just deny, we think that the harm that public nudity has to third parties makes that unacceptable. Therefore, because of the discomfort this causes people for reasons that are beyond their control, because of the effect this has on public morality, and because this is a solution to an imaginary problem, we should not legalize public nudity. Thank you.
Two points today: one on the market failure created by third world nations, and two, on a woman's right to her body. Before that, a whole bunch of refutation. One, we're told: " surrogacy is inherently exploitive " why? A, because a woman who's never been pregnant can't understand. Three responses to that: one, people can still choose to get pregnant for themselves, even though a woman who's never been pregnant before, supposedly can't understand the harms that it does to her body. If that's the case, why can I do choose to do it for myself, but not for someone else? Moreover, why can I choose to do it when the gain for myself is a child, but not when the gain for myself is the money that enables me to feed my child? This is entirely unclear. Two, we simply don't accept that people who can't understand it. Sure, they don't know how to feel the pain, but, much like I don't need to have been in a car crash, to know that I don't want to experience it, that it's quite painful, women don't need to be pregnant to recognize that there are specific harms, that happen due to pregnancy, other specific harms that happen to some women, don't happen to other. We simply don't accept that, education does not solve for this. Lastly, even if it's true, at their worst, they can regulate to ensure that people, that the only people allowed to be surrogates are those people who have had a child before. This is a good time to point out: we are all for regulation of surrogacy, we are all for regulating the contract, regulating the prices, regulating the participants of surrogacy. We're simply not for banning it. B, they say they're going going to be created artificially low prices. Two responses to this: a, regulate a minimum price, that's really not a problem, but b, note that parents often, especially the kinds of parents that are being described to us, often have an incentive to pay more and more, just to get the minimally better things. So, you can hike up the price for playing mozart at night before the baby goes to sleep, hike up the price for eating food that's better for the mother. Anyway, this means they can get more money, and better treatment of themselves simultaneously. C, he says: " society doesn't allow prostitution and this is the same ", two responses: a, it's not the same, the dignity of a prostitute is taken away by allowing her entire body to be owned by somebody else. In the case of a surrogate, you maintain your ability to choose your day to day activities, to act freely as you otherwise would, and you maintain your dignity, if for no other reason than for societal perceptions. B, note many societies do allow prostitutions, when it's done with regulation. We're not entirely sure why they just assert it's the same, and assert it's a negative thing. Lastly, he talks about courts, he says: a, it's difficult to decide between a mother and a contract, note that this is not the case that the surrogate as a mother, she is genetically unrelated, she carried the baby to term. Secondly, he says, this is going to clog the courts. A, precedent is set, once precedent is set, this doesn't get discussed for very long, and b, mh, so it clogs the courts, it's not a real issue. Let's talk about the real issues: one, there's a market failure. Even if you do, as james wants to, ban it in america, ban it in england, the desire to have a child genetically related to yours is enormous, it is so big that people go to places like india, people go to places like calcutta to have this done. What does this mean? It means that all the harms, that james is afraid of, happens tenfold there, when you can't ensure proper regulation, and where you have surrogate farms in order to sell these women at low prices to rich americans, and keep most of the gain, for essentially their pimps. So, even if they do this, nothing is actually solve, you're just passing the buck along to more unfortunate women in worse conditions, we're going to get this done worse to them. Secondly, we say a woman has a right to her body, that right includes deciding. Note the logical links here, a woman today can decide to get pregnant, a woman today can decide to sell her body in labor form. As in, you can choose to do intensive labor work, such as construction for example. A woman today can decide to abort the child, to give it up for adoption, or to keep a child. Where is the jump from all of these decisions she's allowed to make, to the one decision she's not, which is instead of making a child for herself, making a child for someone else? Without properly analyzing why that defeats a woman's ability to think rationally, they simply cannot win this debate. For all these reasons, incredibly proud to to oppose.
The government seems very scared of the future. They seem very scared by things that seem very odd to us. We don't understand why they're so scared of GMOs and we think, in fact, that there are great benefits to these genetically modified crops, and that's why we should definitely support them and allow that to continue to sell them. Let's just go briefly over what yaar spoke about in his first speech. First of all, he said we just don't know enough yet. The studies are all biased. There are two countries in the world that refuse to buy them because somebody told them not to buy them, maybe just, you know, like people who are scared of the government and they're just caving, but who knows? And even if all the science were on the side of GMOs which, by the way, it is, it's still not good enough for us because they have not been they have not been studied for long enough. Well, when will it be long enough? When will it be okay to put genetically modified crops on the market? Because we say, ladies and gentlemen, two things: one is that science is entirely on the side of genetically modified crops being incredibly safe and two, ladies and gentleman, that science has gotten to a place where we don't need to wait decades and decades, generations and generations, before introducing new technologies and new science. We can test it sooner than that, and we can keep an eye on it as we do in the field of genetically modified crops, because we do realize that people are scared, and so every new product that comes out to the market is highly regulated. We think that that is more than enough to say that it is safe. Second of all, this is I mean it makes us laugh a little bit this demand that everything be, you know, like incredibly tested for years and years before it can enter the market because , you know, like most americans eat at mcdonalds every day. Most americans eat highly processed breakfast cereals that are packed full of sugar but hey, add a few vitamins to those and we consider it okay. Enrich a tomato with a few extra nutrients and make it shelf stable so that it can reach rural africa and oh well, no, no, no, we couldn't possibly allow that on the market. So we think that there's also a little bit of a hypocrisy in terms of what's allowed on the market and what's not. Like it seems strange that you would allow highly processed foods onto the market that are shown to cause a lot of health problems, whereas these foods are scientifically proven to be safe and you're not allowing them on the market. Then we have this idea of: well, labeling is not enough. First of all, we think we shouldn't really have to label it but we will, because, you know, people should be allowed to choose and if they really care about this, then fine. But second of all, like the logic of it harms the poor people. Even if we totally agreed with the government's case that there were problems with it, like we're not harming poor people here, all we're doing is giving them more choices. Because either they can only choose the more expensive choice or they can choose the more expensive choice versus the cheaper choice, and they can choose to keep paying the expensive prices or they can choose to pay for safer and cheaper genetically modified foods. What is so great about genetically modified crops? What are the benefits to them? Let's go on to our side of the case. First of all, you can use far less pesticides, right? Pesticides are poisonous, they do pose harms. They're something that we try to rid from our diets. We have to wash off vegetables today that we that we grow, wash off fruit, they the and even that doesn't do enough. The pesticides sink into the foods. We think that this helps solve that problem. Second of all, you can modify foods to do things like reduce hunger, increase economic gain, and increase health. You can add vitamins and nutrients to foods. You can create products that ship better and last longer. So you can create square fruits instead of round, so that they ship in a more economical way, and they can cost less and you can get more to your destination. You can make shelf-stable foods so that even if it takes three weeks in on an open wagon to get to rural sub-saharan africa, it won't spoil as quickly. We think that it's great for farmers because you can grow crops all year round, and you can have more weather resistant crops. These are all things that are wonderful for the market, especially since they're deemed safe, right? Not natural is is a wonderful thing. It is not it is natural for us to utilize nature to enhance nature to benefit us, ladies and gentlemen.
We should not abolish term limits. On our side, we're going to explain to you how this actually is good for democracy and actually promotes stronger democratic norms, directly contrasting with what rachel told you about how they undermine them. Rachel tells you that the most important thing in a democracy is letting people vote for who they want to, but I actually don't think that's true. It's clear that we need some limits on who is allowed to stand for what office. We think that achieving a system of government that has good representation is more important than literally letting people vote for any particular candidate. After all, in a trustee system of government, the individual representative shouldn't be that important, what should matter is if they can represent the people that they claim to represent. So with that in mind, rachel kind of brushes off incumbent bias, but this is actually a really big problem for democracies. It's really difficult for an outsider to ever beat an incumbent just because that person has so much name recognition, and people who are less informed or less educated about politics are going to be unlikely to know who the newcomer is, but they'll recognize someone who's been their senator for twenty years, let's say. And so that person's going to have a huge boost, even if they're not doing a good job and not representing the people that they're supposed to represent. We think that you need to check incumbent bias because it's actually a threat to democracy. If people can get into office and then stay there just because of this huge bias, then they have very little incentive to actually represent people. Rachel tells you that people do have an incentive to represent their constituents because they want to get reelected, but if it's extremely easy because of incumbent bias, then that's simply not true. Next, we tell you that if you don't have term limits, it's almost impossible to ever make radical change or substantial change in a political system. Why? If people are serving for thirty years or thirty five years, they're probably in favor of the status quo by the time they get later into their term of service. Why is that the case? Well, because they helped make the status quo. So if the status quo isn't working for people or if things need to change to adapt to new circumstances, representatives and senators who have been in place for decades are probably not the people who are going to be able to make change. If you don't have term limits, you basically impose a huge bias in favor of the status quo, and that's really bad because countries like the US and britain are becoming more diverse over time, so a lot of viewpoints that are now commonplace or types of people who are now commonplace just weren't around in the same numbers as they were twenty years ago. So you see underrepresentation of non-white people or of women in houses of parliament or houses representatives if you have this massive bias in favor of incumbents. The other side might say that this can benefit women too, and that might be true down the line but for the most part now, it benefits men or it benefits white people, because those are most of the incumbents. Rachel also kind of brushes off the idea that we need to check corruption. And it might be true that most senators or representatives in the US or MPs in britain aren't taking bribes, but in countries like brazil where that's a very big reality, we do think it's important that you limit the ability of people to get into office and then make a living taking bribes for the rest of their life. We need to crack down on corruption by making it harder for people to rely on one particular seat in order to secure the interest of their business or the interest of their special group. And finally, we think that this is a way to prevent a " geriocracy ". We think that it's really important that you have representatives who aren't all senior citizens which is something that often happens in countries that don't have term limits. People get into congress when they're fifty and they stay there until they're ninety, and as a result, they don't really represent the vast majority of people who are young. So we think that a lot of perspectives are missing there and that ultimately government suffers as a result, because there's not a diversity of opinion. For all these reasons, we should not abolish term limits. Thank you.
Don't end progressive taxation. Sam focuses a lot on how the mechanism is complicated but something being complicated is not a reason not to do it if it is the overall better or more beneficial system. We'll be able to track evasion the same way on both sides. If anything it will be easier to hold wealthy people accountable when the tax is progressive because then you will be able to notice that the differences in the amount of money they're paying are not cohesive with what they should be paying much more early. At the end of the day though, we just don't think this is a round you should ever be voting on based on implementation harms because implementation for these kinds of policies can always be something that we revisit later, can add more oversight to you or manipulate in a million other ways that makes it better. So we think that if that's the only issue that sam has, the fact that we will always be getting at least some more money from these people who are more rich but also charging those who are poorer significantly less, will always win the round. Two main arguments: first, on the moral justification. I want to briefly talk about purchasing power parity because the amount that every dollar means to someone who is poorer is infinitely more than for someone who is richer. This is because when money is rarer you value what you can buy with it much more and this is especially true since it also means that a larger portion of your salary goes right to necessities like food. So where as the money that a poorer person spends often goes to making sure they stay alive, for a rich person the money they always have enough money for what they need and the money that they spend is often just that that would have been spent on luxury goods or other entertainment. Thus we think it is unfair to tax everyone at a flat percentage because this percentage will always hit those who are poorer harder. It also means that those who are richer aren't contributing equally to the system which is incredibly problematic because these are exactly the people who should be contributing more because they have benefited more but more than this, we think that richer people make their money by taking advantage of those who are poorer or government infrastructure systems. Since the amount they benefit off of those systems is larger, they should also pay back a higher amount to support it. Our second argument is that it is pragmatically beneficial. It provides the government with more money to put into social services and safety nets especially since this often invests in individuals who are born significantly less privileged than the rich people who end up paying for progressive taxes. It also creates a greater feeling of social civic duty and good works in that people feel like they're actually contributing to the society that they live in and can see the impact that their money makes. It also does things like keep the poor from literally starving due to really aggressive flat taxes because in the status quo if you want to meaningfully tax or in a situation where you have flat taxes if you want to meaningfully tax those were richer you have to hike the rig really high which then ends up disproportionately harming those who are poorer. Sam is worried about people struggling with paying their taxes and we think this is fine because it will really only get complicated in those higher brackets and as sam says those people can pay others to do their taxes anyway so we don't really care about them but moreover, we think that at the point that we have websites like turbotax or any of those which can get through your taxes really quickly even if you are someone who can't pay for the service, we don't think this is an issue. Like HR block is free for use and easily picks people through our tax code despite the fact that there might be complicated things there. Sam worries that people won't pursue higher paying jobs. Like we just don't think this is true and if it is it is a marginal impact at best. Insofar as they'll still make more money at those jobs it's going to be a marginal difference in terms of how much they lose off of that tax and even if this has an impact, it is small at best and doesn't outweigh our other arguments which we think are more important. Like we're fine with a world that has marginally less innovation if it's also a world in which the majority of poorer people have better infrastructure, spending and better social safety nets. Proud to oppose.
We should not abolish the american jobs act. Most of tim's speech relies on the idea that we should abolish the american jobs act because the country has already recovered from the recession and because the government programs that dealt with the recession weren't perfectly successful, but I'm going to explain to you why the act still serves a purpose in today's america. Our first argument is that a good economy doesn't mean that unemployed people need less help. Tim is correct to point out that unemployment is now below five percent. According to the official unemployment metrics, it's actually dramatically higher than that because they've changed how it's calculated to make the numbers look better. But that aside, we tell you that for people who are unemployed, it doesn't really matter how good the rest of the economy is doing or how well, I should say. For people who are unemployed, they still need a way to live, a way to get insurance, a way to pay their mortgage or their rent and provide for their families, so those people still need unemployment benefits. Now the united states has never been very generous with benefits for people, either from their employers or from the government, but we think that the american jobs act was a step in the right direction in terms of giving people more time to look for a job and more time to get back on their feet. If people are struggling to make basic ends meet, they're going to have a harder time looking for a good job that can help them to get back on their feet and contribute as much to the economy. They're going to be scrambling for any work they can get and end up underemployed, which is something that we saw happen a lot during the recession. We think that by continuing the american jobs act, you give people more time to look for good work, and this is really what everyone wants: is for people to, first of all, be able to get a similar job to the one they lost, so that they can keep their standard of living but also continue contributing as much as possible to the GDP so that they can be a productive member of society. Our second argument then is about why we think that the right to work is implicit in a society that requires work. Tim basically says that there is no right to be protected from unemployment, but I think that this is silly for a few reasons. First of all, where do rights come from? Well, they could exist in nature, like one's right to life, I suppose, but clearly the labor system we have today isn't natural or doesn't exist in nature, so rights having to do with work don't come from nature. And they could come from god, I suppose, but as I recall, the bible doesn't say much about unemployment insurance. So I think what we're left with is the idea of rights by convention, that is rights that people agree exist. And I think that if you have a society where people agree that everyone has to work, which is basically modern western society, then you have to give people the opportunity to find work. It would seem very perverse to have a society where people are required to be employed for their entire adult life and then not give those people an opportunity to seek out employment. Now the other side might say that people can find employment even without the american jobs act, but the point remains that this is something that facilitates you to find a better job. It makes this something that people are actually able to devote time and resources to. So I think that inasmuch as people are required to work, we need to take more steps like the american jobs act to help them to get work, rather than just punish them for being unemployed as though this were some sort of moral failure on their part, which I think is a holdover from a much earlier part of american history when this kind of puritan work ethic pervaded our society. But we can be better than that now, and we should be better than that now. And that means helping people in their time of need, like unemployment, and letting them get back on their feet so that they're able to help others. For all these reasons, we should not abolish the american jobs act. Thank you.
I stand in firm opposition to the motion: we should introduce year-round schooling. Year-round schooling is incredibly problematic because it ultimately doesn't represent how people live their lives. If you look at most jobs, except for really the lowest paid jobs, people get a few weeks vacation. They usually get christmas time off. They usually get major holidays off. As such, everyone gets a break, but this program that my opponent proposes, year-round schooling, ultimately denies that for children. It makes it so they can't take any sort of break, which we think is incredibly problematic. With that in mind, I have two arguments but, first, some brief rebuttal. My opponent says that this will be better for learning and better for just being an effective student. They say that you forget things over the summer and that you are far more likely to have trouble in school and trouble focusing if you have this sort of summer vacation. This stands in direct confrontation with my first argument, the importance of relaxation. It' been found that students who sleep more, that is to say, come into school far more relaxed because they got a good night's sleep, actually learn considerably better. We think that this also extends to things like summer vacation. When I spend a few months being able to run around, be happy, we think that the result is one in which people are able to focus in school far more effectively. We see, also, that healthier kids, kids who don't have trouble with the jitters, who don't have trouble focusing because of a variety of other distractions, also do better in school. But summer is a time which most kids lose weight, also become more healthy. As such, we think that if you get rid of summer vacation, kids lose relaxation. They lose fun time. They lose exercise. This makes learning so much more difficult. The result is, then, a world in which children don't learn as effectively. They're stressed more often, and stress can lead to things like eating disorders, mental disorder, physical disorders, less healthy children overall as a result of a complete lack of relaxation and sleep. By having summer vacation, we allow the students to blow off steam, learn habits which are important, ultimately, just have a good time. My second argument is about costs, because we think that this costs more for both the school district and for parents. I'm gonna start with parents because it stands in direct refutation to what my opponent says about how this is better for parents because, during the summer, they have to hire a child care professional. We think this is fundamentally untrue. Why is this the case? There's simply not enough money to pay for year-round schooling without other cuts. We think that you'd likely spend less time in school every single day if you had year-round schooling. The total amount of schooling wouldn't really change, but even the current school day is pretty hard for parents. Working a nine to five means that you drop your kids off on your way to work, and then you try to pick your kids up a few hours before you actually are supposed to get off work. For parents who are unable to do that, they usually pay the school or pay an after-school program to watch them for about an hour. If you cut down the total amount of time kids are at school, we think you'll have to pay for more after-school care every single day or someone to drop your kids off every single day. The result then is that you spend way more money in this regard. We think that during the summer, it's easier to tell your kids just go out and play, go to the pool, spend time with their friends and, as such, you save money on childcare. Alternatively, if there's a group of friends, you can send them all to one of the parent's house every single day of the week, ultimately sharing the load of childcare. Having this day-to-day stress, being unable to actually operate throughout the entire year will likely cost parents more money and make it harder for them to have a good quality of life. But secondly, we think it's just too expensive for school districts. They can't pay a year-round salary for teachers, for buildings. They get money for renting it out. As such, we think that you lose a lot teachers, lose effective curriculum, lose the money that's essential in an already underfunded education system. For this reason, we should not introduce year-round schooling.
Two things were going to discuss today: one, on international relations and direct engagement with proposition and two, on green energy also indirect engagement. A few points of rebuttal, everything will mostly be intertwined. One, they tell us that demand is inelastic. People need heat, people need transportation. They don't get less when it's more expensive. We say they're misleading you. Demand for energy is inelastic, perhaps. Demand for fuel is elastic in that as soon as it can be replaced with alternative methods of energy the demand for fuel goes down. So it is to an extent contentious or mutually exclusive with energy derived from green methods. Secondly, international relations. Let's talk about that. So they say what you end up doing is lowering the power of countries like saudi arabia and venezuela by becoming less dependent on them, them and russia. Two points. A, we say that's somewhat contentious with the first argument. If the demand goes down, meaning that if the prices go down because the supply goes up, that means that your basing yourself on the entire supply. If you're simply replacing the supply available in saudi arabia with the supply available in let's say canada, then you haven't actually changed the price at all. So only one of these arguments can simultaneously be true. Secondly, we think it's a terrible terrible idea. The ability of the united states to implement soft influence on countries like saudi arabia, countries that note, have been instrumental in defending against isis in spite of the fact that it goes against their own self interest. Countries that note, have restrained themselves for years from attacking israel in a way that other countries in the region haven't simply because of united states effect. Removing that relationship means removing power on both sides. Yes it is true that saudi arabia has some leverage on the united states but we but we say that when the economy of the country rests solely on the ability to export gas and note venezuela's recent crumble because it got ran out of gas it means that they are more to be shaped then the other countries. That means are the weaker side in this relationship. This means the ability to implement soft power on them rises massively at the point at which there's an economic dependency between the country. There is nothing we fear more than a russia that has nothing to lose by attacking eastern europe. The fact that they lose the ability to export their gas is the one thing holding them back. We think it's a terrible idea. So that's the first argument. Then, on green energy. So they say look, we have to develop this technology at some point because we're going to run out of gas to which they themselves realize the obvious response is green energy but they say it's not a zero sum game. Why is it a zero sum game? A, money is fungible. Any money that I've invested into these forms of energy can be reinvested into green energy. Given that it's important technology we think it's best to invest as much as possible. But b, investments in infrastructure create long term economic dependency. He himself said we're going to bring jobs back to north america and back to canada or whatever. Note the power of potatoes in iowa. Just because they have so many jobs in there, it is politically near impossible to get rid of entire fields of labor in democratic countries. This means by creating an entire infrastructure and sunk costs and new jobs in this field, you're insuring decades more of dependency on these oils in spite the fact that we could have moved to greener oils much sooner. For these reasons, please oppose the motion.
We should not ban algorithmic trading. On our side, we're going to explain to you why, first of all, we get closer to a perfect market and, second of all, why we avoid human error. And in doing so, I'm going to respond to some of the points that my opponent danny brings up in his speech. So, first, why do we get closer to a perfect market? What does that mean and why is it important? We think that in a free market, the ideal would be that you could exchange any good to anyone who wants to purchase it instantly, with no barriers. Now, although it seems funny to say this, time is actually an important barrier to free exchange. After all, people want certain goods when they want them, and they don't want to wait for them. So we think that it's good for buyers and sellers to make it easier to exchange goods when you can find someone who's willing to enter into a fair contract with you. Algorithmic trading removes time as as large a factor. Obviously, there is still a delay, but it reduces the effect of time to get in the way of the free market. Algorithmic trading doesn't make anyone buy stocks they don't want. It doesn't make anyone sell stocks they don't want. It just makes it easier. Twenty years ago, maybe a little longer, thirty years ago, if I wanted to buy some stock in the acme company, I would have to call a broker and wait all day for him to arrange to buy those stocks, and the price might change dramatically in that time, or some new information might come to light that would change my decision. But, nowadays, thanks to algorithmic trading, it's much faster for me to buy the stocks I want. I can call my broker and he can instantly buy them because some algorithm will sell, or I can have my money in an index fund that can buy and sell instantly in order to maintain stability. So this is clearly actually good for ordinary people trading. That actually gets to something danny talked about, namely, fairness. He tries to portray this as big businesses using technology to bully out the little guy, but this doesn't actually make any sense, because the little guy is not doing day trading in order to make money. At the end of the day, most people have their retirement fund and that's probably the only thing they have invested invested in big index funds. We think that because algorithmic treating makes it easier for index funds to balance out their portfolios and to buy and sell when they want to, at the right prices, that this is actually good for the average person, who's just investing so that they can retire sooner. And in terms of like small traders, yes, this might have been a problem thirty years ago but, nowadays, access to algorithmic trading is pretty widespread for anyone who's a professional, so we just don't think that this is crowding out the hypothetical small trader, not that that's like a really big group trading right now, as far as I know. So I just think that because we closer approximate a free market, and because we improve people's ability to buy what they want, that this is a good thing. But secondly, I'd like to point out that this can help us to avoid human error. How does algorithmic trading work? It's not like AI. It's not like we have some star trek computer making decisions about what to buy. Instead, we program in a list of rules or preferences to the computer, such as " buy apple at this price, and sell at that price, " and then we let them do their thing. The computer never buys too much or too little of a stock as long as we give it the right rules and never buys the wrong stock. It never makes an emotional decision, and that's a huge factor, I think. The fact that algorithmic trading makes trading a less emotional thing and more based on reason and following certain rules must reduce mistakes and make the entire process better for everyone, because humans are naturally likely to be upset if they see a sudden change in stock value. So for all of these reasons, we should not ban algorithmic trading. Thank you.
They paint it with a brush of economic prosperity and equality of opportunity, but the only thing they're doing here is saving a sinking ship. Higher education, as a market tool, is a sinking ship, and we don't want to save it with the dime of the taxpayer. What we're going to talk to you about today is inflation of degrees, why that's so harmful, how subsidizing higher education pushes that through, and what our alternative world looks like. Before that, two responses. One: note, daniel says, economically this is economically beneficial because it is necessarily necessary for employment. Note that leap. No explanation on why it's necessary for employment and crucially, no explanation on why it should be necessary for employment. He's right that in today's economy, employers look to see whether or not you have a degree. We think it's high time that changes. A degree no longer means what it used to mean and no longer is necessary in a way that it used to be necessary. We'd like to cut cut out the middleman. Secondly, he says basically it's important for people to be intelligent so they don't vote for donald trump. Information is available, his correlations here are are just off, yeah, it's not like people went to university and then learned not to vote for donald trump. It's those who were intelligent in the first place, went to university, honestly we prefer them to sit at home and watch educational videos on youtube. So let's talk about inflation of degrees. We've gotten to a point that a degree is necessary in order to get into a job. Now this made sense at some point. At some point, it was a case that information was generally available only through higher education. Offices wanted to make sure that they had informed and intelligent people and so they checked for a degree in order to make sure that they had that. And so more universities and more colleges were built that gave out this degree, and more people opted into getting this degree, and more people presented it in order to get a job, and then more jobs said, " oh, look, we can ask for this too, " and it propelled itself to the point where so many more people today have degrees than ever before. Where is the problem? Two such problems: one, a university degree no longer means what it used to mean. Given all the colleges out there, oftentimes these degrees essentially means somebody sat through classes, slept through half of them for about three years, and we stamped a piece of paper at the end. Two, it is by far no longer the exclusive way of getting an education. Academia is available for free online in almost every form. You can get in to academic papers online, you can get actual academic courses online, you can get shortened versions of courses. You can educate yourself via youtube, via fiverr, via any selection of websites available. Why is this problematic? Because at the point at which you subsidize a degree, you continue the notion that in order to advance in life, you get a degree. You hear it through all of daniel's speech as a reason for why we should subsidize this degree. Essentially, though, a person is wasting quite a bit of money even if you're not paying for the degree. You're still paying for where to live, you're still paying by not working during your degree, by the way, a massive economic harm on their side of the house, where you could have been learning all of this for free on your computer in your home, when you're taking time off from the job that you already hold. How do we shift it? At the point at which fewer and fewer people get a degree, businesses now have an incentive to create other exams to test a person's knowledge. So you check employment history. So you set up a computer room and see how many of you can actually program, how many of you can actually code, all things that you can learn online. At that point, we save massive amount of money, we enable more social mobility because a computer and internet will always be more available to poor people than university and three, four years of not holding a job so that you can attend school, and we improve the economy overall because we get people into the workforce earlier. For all these reasons, don't subsidize degrees, don't continue this farce of academia.
Right, so, in general, I think that all that we've heard from side government's previous speech were arguments that answer the question of would it be better for everyone to get to get tested or should we endorse couples to undergo these treatments, but we haven't heard any argument that truly answers the real burden in this debate, and that is: why is it okay for the state to force couples that really, really don't want to to undergo this invasive and intrusive process and while doing so, why is it okay to, you know, violate the sacred principle of a woman's autonomy over her own body? So the first argument that we hear from the previous speaker is that we need to allow maximum amount of information for doctors. The doctors are the one that take decisions based on the information that they have, so we ought to step in and make sure that they have the entire picture figured out so that they can better consult patients. But this is a really, really strange argument, at least from the way that james constructed it, because it sounds as if it is not, you know, the baby's best interest that side government is concerned about. What they are concerned about is that doctors won't be able to offer the best advice. Well, this logic never caught on anywhere. I mean if I would have done a blood test every three months or so, then my family doctor would have been would have had, you know, the most accurate information. He would have been able to give me great advice. But that doesn't mean that because of this, the state can force me to undergo blood tests every three months. Truly a weird argument. Then, they move on to talk about how this allows us to trace babies that it would have been best if they wouldn't have been born and we can abort them ahead of time. But the thing is that we think that this benefit is almost nonexistent in this debate. Why? Because the parents that are truly resisting and don't want to undergo prenatal examinations and the parents that because of them, side government want to force everyone to do it, are almost exclusively people of faith, and they refuse these tests for religious reasons. And this means that even if we force them to undergo these examinations, and even if we find out that there's some horrible defect in the fetus, it is highly unlikely that they will ever agree to go through with an abortion. So unless james also plans to force these parents to undergo abortions, which is horrible, we didn't spare any suffering or any harm. We just added another harm completely, like for no good reason, the harm of the parents that now needs need to feel that the state has forced them to sin against their beliefs. Lastly, james tells us that this pays off financially. This will save a lot of money for the state that will let could have gone on like treating problems that we could have prevented. So, again, we challenge this benefit. We think that the majority of people today go and have ultrasound exams anyway and we can always, you know, consult, and we can always endorse more couples to do it. But the couples that really choose not to, do it for a particular reason, and it's unlikely that they will agree to any sorts of artificial medical interventions down the line of the pregnancy anyway. So, to conclude, yes, it would have been better if as many people as possible would have gone through prenatal examinations, but we absolutely mustn't force force it upon them against their will. Why? Because for religious people, forcing them to do this is forcing them to break what they consider to be the will of god and to many, this is an unbearable thought. Now, close your eyes for a minute and imagine a situation in which a woman is being forced to undergo an ultrasound exam against her will, as she is fighting to get free. This is a horrible picture. Now, I don't know what you do in that type of situation, but every solution that I that comes to mind seems equally unacceptable. You guys must oppose.
Taxation is a necessary evil. We have to tax our citizens to be able to provide essential services or certain public goods that the market cannot provide all by itself, things like national security, for instance. But beyond that, we think that high taxation is economically inefficient. It punishes the rich and by doing so, it harms mainly the poor and therefore, we must oppose it. Before we move on to explain why this is the case, let's just refute the two arguments that came from the previous speaker. So the first thing that we hear is that progressive taxation is more fair than a flat tax rate. And they tell us that, you know, the philosophical foundation for taxation is that when individuals enter society, they give up certain rights in order to gain other rights or other, like, access to certain public goods, and if you benefited more from society and you received more public goods, then it makes sense to require you to pay back more in return. There are three problems that we have with this argument. Firstly, so they lean on the theory of social contract, but we simply are going to reject this theory right from the beginning. We think that it's philosophical mumbo jumbo because no one has ever truly gave his consent to enter that contract. We say that you don't have a choice but to live in society, and without consent, it's just unclear to us why any of the rest is like stands in the debate. But secondly, we say that even if we would have accepted this as a justification for taxation, we think that progressive taxation is set by the level of my current income and that is a problem, because whoever said that it's necessarily the same people that earn more money today that have also received more benefits from society? What if I had been, like, what if I were was brought up hard and I had to build myself up with my own two hands, without any special privileges, without society's help? Then I get screwed over twice because I receive less and I am forced to give more. This is unfair, note, according to their own criterion themselves. But lastly, like thirdly, we say that even if we would have thought that income is the right way to measure how much you enjoyed like more public good from society, we would ask why isn't it enough that we have a flat tax rate, meaning, like, a set percentage of my income that's being taxed, and that already takes care of the rich paying more than the poor. And that's exactly what side government wants. Moreover, we say that the rich also pay more, like, taxes to the country through direct taxation, like like indirect taxation like VAT, for instance, because they buy more expensive products. And if they have a firm in their possession, then they also pay corporate taxes. So, progressive tax rate means that all of this isn't enough. We need to take more money from the rich, and this is essentially just this means that we are punishing whoever made it in life. And the analysis that we've received from side government just isn't sufficient in order to actually justify all of this. The second argument is that like they tell us that this will create more revenues to the government. We simply don't see this as a good thing. Again, we think that taxation is a necessary evil, and we should always aspire to keep it at a minimum. So, lastly, we move on to explain why we think that this will be economically inefficient and will harm everybody. And what we say that what side government neglects to mention is that taxation always operates as an inhibitor to economic activity, and it's easy to understand why. We say that people act rationally, and they act in order to maximize profits. This is especially true to the people that make a lot of money, and those are the ones that have a lot to lose from progressive taxation because they know that a large chunk of their revenues is about to be taken away by the government, and they factor this into their decisions, which makes them minimize their activity. This means that they need to hire less workers than they otherwise would have, which means that it's the weakest citizens that need those jobs that are going to be kept unemployed. I don't have time to further elaborate but I think my point is now clear. So for all these reasons, we are proud to oppose.
Building up is the future and we need to embrace it. We think on the side of the opposition that it is better to build tower blocks and to deal with some of the implications that were mentioned in the government speech rather than the much more harmful implications that we see, both environmental and the impact on the poor, when we when we limit tower blocks and we limit the number of stories that buildings can have in large cities. Why is that so? Well first of all let's deal with the points that we heard on the other side. We heard a lot about the pollutants and the fact that there's going to be a lot of that there's a huge footprint that's massively multiplied, that there's a lot of light and noise pollution when we when we allow so many people to live in the same city in the same areas in a big city. But we think ladies and gentleman that there's a few things a few differences here. First of all, we think that when you have people living so close together, when you have so many people living in the downtown area of a city for example, when you have these huge high-rise buildings that are so close to the areas in which in for example the financial districts and so close to the areas in which these people work, and they're all and they are all in the city within the city limits, where it's much easier to limit the number of cars that can go that can be that can drive through the city, and also naturally there's a there is people are less likely to drive to work or to even own a car when they live in a big city. We think that this means that you get less of a footprint in many ways. We think that we decrease the footprint that comes from, for example, transportation which is a huge part which is a huge contributor to to the pollution problem today. So we think that we can limit that by having people live closer to each other by having residential areas being built up and being built up close to the districts in which people work and that's where that's what happens when you allow high rise buildings and tower blocks in big cities. We also think ladies and gentlemen that when you send people sprawling that you spread the light and noise pollution in such a way that makes it exponentially worse. Why? Because you're always going to have light and noise pollution in big cities. You're always going to have a lot of those issues in big cities. You're always going to have the lights on in the big cities no matter what. But what happens is when you send more and more people to further and for to more remote areas, and keep building up around, and you keep building the city out and and enlarging the limits of the the city limits and sending more and more residential and building up more and more residential areas, you spread the light and the noise pollution. You create more and more light pollution. It is much easier ladies and gentleman to keep that all centered in big cities, and yes we realize that there are some problems that have to be dealt with. We realize that there is some sacrifices in those big cities. When it means that you have large swaths of land in between cities that are not as effective. You don't need to light up those highways at night because there's not as much traffic going on there. And so you can save on that and you also of course then preserve some of the natural resources that you have in the area that gets bulldozed when you send people sprawling into rural areas and build them up into new newer and bigger cities instead of building up in already existing cities. So we've talked a lot about the environmental impact as our reputation as well to the other side. But there's also an impact on the poor people. Why is that? Because the people who are not going to be able to afford to live in the cities, the people who are not gonna be able to live to to be able to afford to live you know in the downtown areas close to where they work, are the people who also cannot afford to commute to their job later on. It will be harder for people to get jobs when they live far away from where they work. It means that they have longer commutes, it means that you're putting them in that you're forcing them to buy cars or to not be able to get a job, or to have extremely long commutes, which is a huge drain on families that are already struggling. We think that that impact on the poor is a significant is a significant factor that needs to be taken into account. We think that tower blocks are the future, we need to look up to the sky to see where our cities are going. Thank you.
We should not abandon television. In all debates about television there is inevitably a reference to streaming talking about how streaming is the future, streaming is far better for all the points that the government points out, that you have more selectivity, that it allows you to view things on demand, that it gets you to have more autonomy over what you're supporting. But the problem with this is that streaming is in its nascent stage of development and it is about to get way pricier. We see things like disney about to open up its own streaming service. We see things like television networks like CBS starting their own streaming platforms and we think that ultimately, streaming is going to become much like cable where if you want to get all of your favorite shows you're going to have to buy either a bundle of services or you're going to have to pay for a number of different services which means that cable and streaming TV and streaming are not all that different. The first argument they make is that television is obsolete in the way that we bundle channels, sets people up to over price in that streaming allows for more select for a more selective way of viewing TV. So the first argument is exactly what I just said that streaming through things like disney creating a new platform is about to get much more expensive because if all content creators are creating their own streaming platforms because they see how lucrative things like hulu and netflix are one, they're going to pull their content from hulu and netflix and two, you're going to have to start purchasing all of these other streaming services which means it's probably just more efficient economically to just buy cable and have access to all these different things. But secondly and incredibly importantly, good streaming services require the financial backing of TV because television programs are what draw people in to the streaming services. Look at netflix for example, the most popular things that are streamed on netflix are not networks originals and are not what drew people into netflix to start with. But it's the fact that you could watch parks and recreation and the office and archer and other shows that were only made possible because of the high production budgets of television and so we think that to have quality content like what we enjoy, you need the balance of low cost streaming services or even things like youtube and higher cost, higher production value services that you get through things like cable. They say that TV isn't diverse but first, this is a huge generalization. There are a number of different TV networks that are becoming progressively more diverse to get with the times. Second, is that streaming is just not immensely better. If you look at the front page of youtube any day it's mostly going to be a bunch of white dudes and thirdly, this isn't an argument for why we need to abandon television, it's a reason why we should have both, why we should seek out diverse contact. The final argument they make under this is that smaller artists are able to break through with streaming. Again this doesn't explain why we need to abandon television. This is just a reason why youtube is a good thing to have and the second thing is that as you can see from many people that start on youtube people jump ship to television because it provides a much wider audience that they can access so it allows smaller artists to build themselves up into a larger brand that's ultimately better for them. The second thing, the last argument they make is that there's more spending autonomy through things like streaming. You don't need to support problematic channels because you just want to watch you know one channel but you also need to get fox and you're not a conservative and you don't want to pay fox. Well first and most importantly, most revenue comes through advertising anyway. The amount of money that I'm giving to fox because I buy a basic cable package is incredibly small compared to the actual revenue that they generate from advertising. Second, this same problem exists on netflix. Like if you think that a lot of the content on netflix is problematic, you're still funding netflix so they can pay for that content. So it's not like this doesn't exist in other spheres and finally as we mentioned earlier this bundling creates better content because it pours more money into the system that allow for higher production value shows which are ultimately the things that are the most popular with consumers. For these reasons, we should not abandon television.
Don't abolish needle exchange programs. First I want to address sam's argument about this being a misuse of resources. We just don't think this is the case. The reason that government taxes at all is in order to support programs and policies that help the citizens they serve and kind of come in and support situations in which maybe capitalism or the private sector doesn't solve or doesn't provide for the needs of citizens. Addiction is not something people can just choose not to propagate once it has happened. It is not their fault that they continue because they are chemically bonded to the substance that it hurts not to. So when sam says look, these people put themselves in the situation so why should we help them, he's misunderstanding the chemical function of addiction. But moreover we just don't think this matters first because the overflow harvest of the rest of society justify public spending on it. But also just because someone put themselves in the situation doesn't mean they aren't deserving of help. One could argue that for every single person on welfare they could probably have made a string of different decisions within their lives that would have kept them from being in that situation. We don't do that because we know that when people are in shitty situations it doesn't help to blame them for it, rather we focus on getting them out of it so that in the future they don't have to do things like rely on government assistance. Two main arguments, first on preventing the spread of blood borne illnesses. Sam keeps talking about how there isn't any trickle down from needle exchange programs. Literally this is just wrong. Like some of the most important impacts are to non-drug users. It protects innocent people who never took drugs in the first place since in the status quo old needles often get left in public areas, under bridges, along sidewalks. These are places where children run and play and where adults also spend a lot of their time. We need to minimize the risk of the people who interact with these areas getting harmed. It is good enough to win the round already because at the end of the day the number of drug users is going to stay the same either way, it it's just a question of how safely they dispose of those needles. Sam worries about ghettoisation. That's already true right? Like poor neighborhoods already have the highest rate of drug addicts, so it would make sense of these areas would have needle exchange programs anyway just because you often have the highest volume of people who would use them. But this doesn't raise the rates of drug use at all right? Like because the drug users are just coming in to exchange their needles. Needle exchange program aren't causing drug users, it just means that these areas in particular will now have less blood borne illnesses and will have less dirty needles fling around. Our second argument is about helping addicts. First I think that sam's argument about how this makes drug use cheap is just unfair right? Like this isn't the way that people make their weighing calculus. They don't say drugs are affordable therefore I'm going to get addicted, rather they get addicted and then they do everything they can to continue that addiction, even if it means that when they cannot have access to clean needles reusing the ones they already have or leaving those dirty needles out. So we think that as long as there are still a stigma against drugs more broadly and education as to why you shouldn't do drugs, you're not actually going to be increasing the number of people doing drugs on our side of the house. Moreover addicts don't stop doing drugs because of a lack of clean needles, they just use dirty ones, which is how this becomes a problem in the first place. Like they're not going to be buying needles on either side of the house. It also just means that on our side of the house we get time to interface with addicts that doesn't occur in the status quo since a lot of them end up homeless and avoid social institutions. So we think it's positive that you can cover your needle exchange program and buildings in advertisements for rehab or provide addicts with a list of options every time they come. You could even build exchange programs near a rehab facility. Like all of this provides you with more control over our environment and over the status quo than what's happening right now. Proud to oppose.
We should not ban telemarketing. In this round we're going to go through the arguments presented by the government's side and explain why we think they are insufficient to justify banning telemarketing. So the first argument that we get from the government side is that telemarketing is intrusive and therefore it should be banned. The first argument to make under this is that there's a right to privacy in your home and we think that that's a fairly reasonable point to make but we also think that telemarketing doesn't violate that in a meaningful way. You don't have to answer. Everyone's phone nowadays has caller ID. Everyone can see when an eight hundred number or an eight eight eight number is calling and they can choose not to answer the phone. They next say that this is something that you simply can't escape but for the reasons we explained this is blatantly untrue. It's entirely possible to just not answer the phone but in addition to that, there's also do not call lists that you can be placed on to ensure that you don't receive these phone calls. So if you if you are so annoyed by the phone calls that you're getting by these telemarketers and you can't deal with the fact that you can just not answer the phone, then you can be placed on a do not call list and therefore your privacy is secure without banning an entire industry and that's the thing that we think is so important in this round is that even if even if telemarketing is annoying, even if it's something that most people don't want to deal with, the fact that it is annoying is not justification for banning an industry. We think in a free market system people should be allowed to solicit over the phone just like people should be allowed to solicit door to door. You can turn someone away. You can choose not to answer and that's entirely acceptable. But we think in a free society it's it's something that is both in very difficult to enforce as far as like banning someone from making phone calls but also is something that should just be allowed when there are easy alternatives that allow the free market to continue to exist. Finally, under this first point he says it's a waste of time. Again it's like thirty seconds of your time. You answer the phone, you see it's a telemarketer and you hang up, that's easy as that. We just don't think that this is a major violation of privacy and therefore it doesn't require any sort of government action. The second argument that they make is that this is a predatory predatory practice and sets the standard that states should ban practices that have disproportionate harms on certain communities. We think that this is a slippery slope standard. We think that there are many instances in which different practices and different actions have disproportionate acts impacts on communities because those are communities that disproportionately opt into systems that may be harmful to them and we think that in those instances people are using their own free will to make decisions for themselves and it may be based on communal standards that are different from other communities but that's totally acceptable. We think that this standard of paternalism is too easily flexible and is not sufficient for justifying government action. So the group that the government side is talking about is the elderly. They say the elderly are abused are abused by this, they don't know about telemarketing practices, they're taken it usually. We have four responses: the first is that there's checks on abuse when it does happen so just canceling credit card payments. The second is that we think that when the when they say things like even legit businesses do this it shows we need a more complete response that banning telemarketing isn't going to solve. Things like education, things like things like do not call list that you can place elderly people on. We think that the elderly are already sufficiently stripped of their autonomy in in a large amount of situations and that stripping them with the autonomy of how to spend their money is not a proper way of going about solving a problem that in all reality is not a major issue. As we've been saying throughout the round, we think that you should allow the free market when alternatives exist to prevent abuse and we've outlined a number of alternatives that show that telemarketing is not a major problem and for these reasons, we should not ban telemarketing.
We should not cancel pride parades. So before we get into rebutting the arguments made by the government side, we want to explain why we think pride parades are so important. We think that pride parades allow for a marginalized community, a community that until very recently has mainly had to remain in the dark due to social stigma, it allows this community to not only come together when it is largely disparate and it is largely spread out, it allows people to come together that otherwise wouldn't have found each other and form relationships, form communities, form bonds, and form support structures, but also it allows for a celebration that has never before been allowed for this community: to say that we are here, we are proud, we are we are human, and we deserve to be celebrated, we deserve to be accepted. We think that this pride parade not that pride parades not only allow for this community to come together and to celebrate, but it also comes in tandem with wider discussions. For example, many pride parades are hosted in the same month, and it creates something like a pride month in which people talk about LGBT issues and they talk about issues both in the community and in their societies. And we think it allows for a larger discussion and that for many people they're able to experience this either as allies or they're able to have more empathy with people, once they hear stories that are elevated because of these parades, because of this kind of month that occurs. And so we think that pride not only allows for positive self-affirmation for members of the community, but it also allows people outside of the community to get a better understanding of their trials and tribulations. Responding now to the three arguments made by the government side. The first is that this creates a target on the community, that the LGBT community is already the target of a ton of different hate crimes and that in example, in israel, there a counter-protests and attacks on on these pride parades. So, three responses to this. First, whether or not there is one instance of these things happening, it is empirically the case that the odds of some sort of a hate crime like this are incredibly low in these for these parades, one, because there's often a ton of security provided both by organizers but also by public officials ; two, because it is because this gathering is often so large, it's unlikely that any sort of major counter-protest will occur. These gatherings, these parades, also often happen in more urban areas which are generally more accepting of the LGBT community. But more importantly, we think that this argument is just a reason to give into hate, that revolutionaries and that freedom fighters in the past have, time and again, faced these challenges and much worse, and we think that it is important that these people still allow themselves to come together as a community and affirm that they deserve to exist and that they should be proud of who they are. We think that it spits in the face of the entire gay rights movement to say that these pride parades shouldn't occur because of fear, because of the attacks on them, because these are issues that they face in their day-to-day life. But what they don't get in their day-to-day life is a time for public celebration of their identity. The second issue that the government side says is that this is bad for public opinion and that many moderates are turned off by being, essentially, faced with gay people. So we think that, in general, if someone is is going to be turned off by a pride parade to the extent that they no longer believe that these people have the right to some like basic to like just basic rights, we think that these are probably not going to be the people that are advocates for them anyway and aren't going to be a tipping point for meaningful legislation. The final argument they make is that pride parades give undue power to organizers and put power in these organizers' hands. But, frankly, these organizers are often the leaders of local LGBT communities anyway. They're often thought leaders. They're often organizing leaders anyway. And so we think that even if they are spouting bad ideas, it is non-unique to pride parades, and ultimately not a reason that they should be cancelled. For these reasons, we should not cancel pride parades.
The government. Communism at its finest. If we can't all have it then no one should have it. It makes no sense, ladies and gentleman, to ban private education when we could simply say people who can afford it, people who get in and people who can get scholarships can have a great time there. And people who don't can go to the public institutions that already exist and are just fine by most standards. We think, ladies and gentlemen, that this idea of a fundamental equality of access by closing private institutions you're just not going to get it. That's no such thing as fundamental equality of access. Nothing will ever be equal in a world where we allow people to possess property in different amounts and where we allow people to to succeed at things that they're good in and not force everyone to have the same amount of smarts. Typically the people who do go to harvard, yale, princeton, they are the cream of the crop. Even the huge percent who go there on scholarships, which the government conveniently ignores. What I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about two main points and through that I'm going to continue with my rebuttal to the other team. I'm going to talk about the right to education and why we certainly think that we fulfill that even without banning private institution. And we're going to talk about banning private how how banning private institutions brings down the level of education as a whole. So first of all the idea of a right to education. This does not mean that everyone has to get exactly the same education or even the same level of education. What it means is that everyone is entitled to access to a base level of of education. To a minimum level of education. It does not mean that everyone has to has has to have access to all the education that might exist in the world. Just like we don't force institutions to accept somebody who doesn't meet their standards in terms of smarts, we also think that we don't have to force as as long as there is an institution out there that will accept them for something as long as they can get into community college and get a degree in something, we think that that is fine. That is enough when it comes to the right to education. We think that that is fine. In the same way that we would never been tutoring, although it seems to me as though the government might want to do exactly that. They might say no it's not fair to have people who can be to who can afford tutoring and some people who can't. Let's just not let anyone gain any extra education above the level that the public public sector can afford. We think that that's ridiculous. We think the people who can't afford above and beyond and who and who are able to succeed above and beyond that's great, and we think the people who can't afford it often are afforded subsidies and we think that that's a wonderful system that should be encouraged. But second of all this idea that banning private private institutions are somehow going to like make the public education better, it's exactly the opposite. Right, why? First of all money will be lost. You can't assume the people who donate to private institutions today because they went there, because they're they're linked to their alma mater, because they feel because they can name buildings after themselves, if it just goes into this big vast pool of money that gets allocated to everywhere, that they're going to keep giving this money, it's ridiculous. You won't get those private donations and so there's a lot less money in the system. Second of all, academia becomes a much less attractive profession. Right? Because there are no excellent institutions to strive for. Because there's less money all around. Because there's less positions all around, right? Rather less positions, this is the third thing, because there's going to be less less departments because it's going to be subject to budget cuts, because there's going to be less humanities, for example, departments because governments won't have the money to fund it. For there are many places around the world where they just won't have any good education at all because today the only good education that they have is by importing branches of private universities privately and this is the education that they can give. And yes it's true that some people are then not able to afford that good education, but at least there are some people who have access to that education. It seems ridiculous to tell everybody to deny everyone access to to anyone access to education because not everyone will be able to get it. We think, ladies and gentlemen, that the proposal is counterintuitive and will do exactly the opposite of what it intends to do. Thank you.
This isn't a debate about whether or not you need to spend money to make money. This is a debate about who needs to spend money and how. In opposition, we do not think that in times of economic depression and great amounts of unemployment you need to sit there and hope things get better. We think you need to act. We think you need jobs to be created. We simply think it's done better by the free market than it is by governments. Our argument today is going to be simple. Short term businesses during a a depression are bad businesses. The government is particularly bad at recognizing what these businesses are because they tend tend to suit their short term needs and governments tend to think in a short term manner and the free market it substantially better at recognizing these. Two points of rebuttal to yaar: one, yaar talks about says unemployment is bad. Say sure, that's not the argument. The argument is state versus market. Secondly, yaar says a strong market is good for the rich people. Again, sure happy to concede that. We show you a stronger market on our side of the house. So let's talk about short term businesses. So, exactly yaar's explanation of lowering the purchasing power of people means that when you're creating a business during a depression, the business needs that you're trying to meet are not those of the lower echelons of society. Indeed not though that the median echelons of society who have recently suffered a hit to their economic purchasing ability and therefore looking to tighten their belt. Generally speaking they'd be, in order to meet the needs of the higher echelons of society, those who still have some form of purchasing power. The problem is you've just taken away, by taxation, the ability of those groups to purchase as much as well. In addition to that, you've also made them dislike these companies specifically because these are the companies in the name of which their taxation has risen. But it's not just about people it's also about societal needs in a time of depression. You have fewer businesses able to run which means that the business needs of businesses are substantially smaller. We would note that over time it tends to be businesses that support other businesses which are safer and more prosperous for society. Governments however are looking to make a quick buck, they're looking to get as many people in jobs as quickly as possible. In order to do that, we say they necessarily have to create a bunch of these businesses that enter a failing market in the first place. Why are government short term thinkers? Because they're going to be replaced in four years, because in three years when re elections come up they want to be able to point and say look how many people we got into jobs. In order to get as big a number of possible they can't take long enough to calculate the long term harms of this. This means governments are setting you up for another cycle of rise and then depression again. Why are businesses compare comparably good at doing this? Because a corporation is able to mark a few terms of of losses in order to make big gains. Take a look at investment companies is an example of this. They give out and give out and give out money knowing that five years down the line one of these is going to pay off big. This is certainly the type of thing you can explain to an executive board during a time of depression. When you allow companies to take advantage of the fact that a week cut that a weak economy means cheaper buying price and means return a gain return on investment that is huge five ten years down the line, you allow the free market to build the businesses that are going to last.
We in opposition also believe that education is important, but it is not all that matters when we talk about children. We think that side government is taking this way too far. They are treating children as if they are robots whose entire purpose is to sit down and and collect as much information as possible so that they could later on help promote society when they grow up. Their entire line deals with how year-round schooling will lead to better students with better grades and how it's a shame to be wasting time, because we could have been been teaching children more stuff, or on how, god forbid, some students will not be focused in class on there, like, a week before they go on vacation. We totally disagree that the metric by which this debate should be judged is only what leads to better education as if this is all that matters. Because if this were the situation, then why not offer that all children need to live in boarding schools and just study for seven for seven days a week, fifteen hours a day? This way we could have taught them even more, but I think it's fairly obvious to all of us that this is wrong, and it's not just a matter of like how effective this would be. We assume that even if this would have been effective, even if we truly could have been teaching children plenty more this way, this would still be very, very wrong. This type of logic may have caught on in some communist country like china or soviet russia, but it completely contradicts every set of beliefs that cherishes individual liberties. So before I move to talk about the harms of like implementing a system in which you only get one week off every every couple of months, but there's no one big holiday, it's important to note that side government grossly exaggerates when describing the harms in the status quo. They tell you that that students forget everything and have to be retaught from the start. First, we just think that that's exaggerated. We say that studying and is is basically like riding a bicycle, it doesn't really take you a month to to to refresh yourself and relearn. You pick it up quite quickly after one lesson or maximum two lessons. B, this could this problem could easily be fixed or solved by handing assignments or homework for children that would have to that they would have to prepare during their summer vacation in order to stay sharp. Plenty of schools do this, and we have no problem with this. Regarding like all the rest of their points, again, the fact that we could have taught them more is always true, but that's not how you win this debate, not without explaining why is this so crucial to be teaching children more and more and more stuff. So, why do you why do we think that it's critical to allow a long summer vacation and we cannot just like we cannot just be happy with one week off here, one week off there. First of all, because we believe that this phase in life when you're a student is quite reasonably the last like part of your life where you get to have such a long vacation. Most people graduate and then they find some sort of job, and they will like have an entire lifetime to be working year round, with short vacations here and there. But this experience in which you now have a full month or two months to just do whatever you feel like is precious and priceless, and we think that it would be a huge shame to be taking away from people the very few times in which they do get to have this, people that will anyway have an entire lifetime to develop a consistent pattern, as they tell us, or a boring routine, the way we would call it. Second of all, we think that one week vacation is just not enough time to be doing a lot of things, like going traveling to a to a foreign country with your family for more than a couple of days or going to a summer camp where you get to meet a lot of friends outside of your school. Where else would you get the chance to do something like this if you were learning all year round? These are experiences that are just as enriching, if not more, than sitting in class and multiplying numbers. There's more to life than the four walls of your classroom, and there is no better time to go out and explore everything than when you are young student. We call you to oppose.
Before we begin there is something that, at least to me, was remained unclear in the mechanism, and that is the question of what exactly is going to get subsidized and what isn't. Do liberal arts studies or humanities studies are they going to get the same full funding like computer science or engineering? We think that this is important because no matter what the answer is going to be, this raises some serious questions and difficulties but anyway, we're going to put that aside for now in the hope that government will make this clear in the next speech. So, side government is asking to convince us in the following things: a, education, no matter what age, is a basic right. B, if there is a basic right, then this automatically means that the government is also responsible to fully fund this. C, subsidizing, like a full subsidy of higher education, is going to be a smart investment that pays off in the long run, both economically and socially. We disagree with literally every one of those stages. Let's explain why. Firstly, on education in every age being a basic right. So government basically start by saying: look, we can all agree that primary education is a basic right and therefore, we must agree that that higher education is also a basic right. Now that is a logical leap. There are plenty of protections and special rights that we provide children but not adults. Children are protected, for instance, from criminal liability. And according to government's logic, if that is true, then this should also apply to adults. This is of course absurd. Specifically, the line that we cross between primary education to higher education isn't at all random. Primary education is a crucial condition to succeed in life, no matter what field you're going to to find yourself in. And that's what makes it a basic right. It is also a tool of the state to create a shared basis of knowledge to all of the citizens, sort of a way to shape the shared narrative and the collective identity of the nation. Higher education, on the other hand, isn't a crucial condition in plenty in like a lot of fields and and frankly, in the previous years, it is becoming less and less critical for success. In addition, there is also no element of like a a shared foundation here because everybody studies different things entirely, so no, this is not a basic right. Secondly, even if we were to agree that this is a basic right, this doesn't automatically mean that the government need to completely fully fund it. Food is also a basic right, right? And still the state helps you very partially and does not provide food for everyone free. We need to say this very clearly. The state already participates today in the funding of higher education in public institutes but in a partial way. We think that demanding that it will provide for all of it is simply a misguided way of perceiving what the state's role is. Why isn't it enough to fund scholarships for less well-off students and continue collecting money from students that have no problem to fund themselves, for instance? And lastly, we get to the question of whether this is a smart investment. Now, as I have already hinted, higher education might have been critical for success in the market ten years ago or fifteen years ago, but the market is rapidly changing today and more and more of the most desired job places, for instance, in google or facebook, don't even demand a an academic title. We think that before we run off to spend billions of dollars on higher education free for everybody, then it's worth at least heavily considering these institutional changes, and that is something that side government isn't even considering. For all these reasons, please oppose.
I think that the prime minister has been a little unfair or at the very least unclear enough in his definition of what we are debating here because his entire speech focuses on how we must like better make or sure better enforce that the people who are being granted asylums are standing up to the criteria of who actually deserves it and that you know ordinary immigrants aren't just taking advantage of this by falsely pretending to be worthy of asylums and we totally agree. We don't have any interest in people being granted asylums without them actually deserving it. The thing is that in today's reality with the ongoing civil war in syria, there truly is a significant rise in refugees that do stand up to the criterion and that do actually deserve it. So I think that it is side government's burden in this debate to defend things like setting stricter quotas of exactly how many asylums are granted that are necessarily going to leave out certain refugees that do deserve it. Not just to say that we need to better look out for fraudulent claims because this is just simply pretty obvious. So it is in this light that we turn now to answer side government's claims. First, they tell us that the government needs to first and foremost look out for its own citizens and the influx of unskilled labor is harmful for the economy and comes at the expense of the citizens. So the first answer here is that we are just unsure that it truly is harmful for the economy. Even if it is unskilled labor. As long as we strive to make them fit in and help them find jobs they certainly might contribute to the economy just like any other form of unskilled foreign labor. You know researchers looking into this question today are at the very least undecided if not even actually leaning in favor of it and we mustn't forget that america has been billed as a safe haven for immigrants and refugees that were fleeing harsh circumstances and it emerged as the free world's leading superpower. Second answer here is that even if it is a burden to some degree, we think that we simply cannot just ignore the moral meaning of sealing the gates. It's true that the country is obligated to the well being of its citizens but this is not an absolute principle. Like totally that is to say it doesn't mean that we can justify complete indifference to the unbearable misery of other people just because this will create mild inconvenience to our citizens and the third answer is that we think that's the foreign policy of the west in general, in the united states specifically, has a hand in bringing upon the horrific situation in syria by refusing to intervene in time and by seceding the control over to russia that is backing assad. The very least that we can do is not to meet these refugees fleeing there with a shrug and a cold shoulder. The next thing that we hear is that people will take advantage and cheat. Well there is there are always people that will take advantage of loopholes. This is just a part of reality but again, we are totally in favor of taking whatever step is necessary to minimize this. Lastly they tell us that if we won't limit the a silence now, then populist leaders will take care of getting rid of it altogether later and we think that this logic is basically just giving up to populism. We think that if anything, it is the other way around. If we start compromising on our principles now, it will be that much easier to get rid of them completely later. Besides we think that populist leaders like trump don't really concern themselves with the facts and the correct data of just how much asylums are being granted today. This is what makes them populist. This means that no matter how much asylums that we're going to grant trump will always exaggerate and blow up the numbers in order to serve his own message. So what side government is proposing makes very little difference. Look we've already shut down the doors before to refugees like for instance jewish refugees escaping persecution and mass murder in europe. That is one of the most shameful episodes in american history. Let's not repeat the same policies now. Oppose the motion.
Don't limit the use of birth control. I think the problem with a lot of tim's advocacy is that he doesn't recognize what the directionality is for the hypersexulization of society and the rate at which people have sex ie there is none. Recognize that hypersexuality in society is vastly due to the way that pop culture portrays women and men, portrays sexual relations, and portrays when these should be occurring and objectification within that. And none of this gets shifted by tim's like proposal right? Like not allowing birth control doesn't change what people see in the media or what producers put in the media insofar as that is still what sells presumably or like what makes money or any number of other incentives that control why things go where they go. So we think the problem becomes that once tim doesn't get any of the benefits that he gets all that is left is the harms of having unwanted pregnancies, individuals who are getting STD's because they're not protected and just generally people being limited from having sex. Two main arguments, first on women's choice and destigmatizing sex. We don't think that the government or any private entity has the right to limit access to birth control. It is the woman's body and therefore she should be what it should be her choice what to put into it but also when it comes to the consensual sex between adults it should be their choice what they use in order to prevent pregnancy or if they want to prevent pregnancy at all. So even if society is hypersexualized as tim we told you this isn't caused by prevalence of birth control but rather pop culture that tim doesn't change. So now you just have less access to the ways in which you make that's sexualization safe. We also just should be passed the point where we try to limit the way that people have sex with each other. Like it's the twenty first century. Individuals when they're consenting adults or even when they are consenting teenagers presumably should be able to choose for themselves how they want to live and the government trying to to interfere with that has historically been so unhelpful and so just like contrarian and often times actively detrimental that we just shouldn't be at that point anymore. Our second but also under this we want to talk about sex being good because I think a lot of tim's assertions are just like oh people having sex is a bad thing, people shouldn't have sex until a certain age. Like of course there are certain emotional consequences that come with sex. We think that oftentimes individuals are able to weigh against that for themselves. Like it feels good for you, it's a good mechanism for balancing stress, it creates intimacy with another person. Like birth control allows individuals to access the benefits of sex on their own terms and without the fear of pregnancy. And given that sex is generally a good thing we don't understand why you would want to stop them from doing so. Because even for teenagers, this is often like a fairly integral part of their development and their self actualization. It is to learn more about their bodies like enjoy that pleasure those are all positive parts of growth. Our second argument is about preventing unwanted pregnancy and the consequences. Tim says there'll be more parental control and that like you should have limits over eighteen. The problem is that he just doesn't have a way to stop young people from having sex. Like just factually historically whenever people have been like oh look we're just not going to give them condoms that means we won't have sex that's when you have the highest rates of teen pregnancy because teens don't care what adults want them to do. They're going to find ways to sneak around either way. And even when the culture isn't hypersexual people under the age of eighteen still want to have sex with each other and it's a lot worse to pretend it's not happening because that's when you end up with STD's and unwanted pregnancies and moreover now people just won't come to adults for help because they're going to feel like they're doing something legally wrong at this point. So parents even if they know the best for their children on their side of the house won't because those children just won't go to them anymore. But also we just want to contest the idea that parents know the best for their children at all. Like at the end of the day, it is not the case that parents always know what's best. There are plenty of naive or controlling parents that actively harm their children so we just think this isn't a good argument. We don't need unwanted children in the world, we don't need to derail sixteen year old lives because of an unwanted pregnancy that we can prevent. Like birth control is a good. Proud to oppose.
The government unfairly cherry-picked the most problematic standardized tests that exist today and says, " aha, there are problems with it, and therefore we should abolish them all. " And we think, ladies and gentlemen, that they have not that they have not proven that they have not fulfilled their burden of proof today in showing us what all standardized testing should be abolished. We think, ladies and gentlemen, that there is an important place for standardized testing in our education system. We think that there are lots of benefits to creativity in the classroom, but you can't collate data or rank students for, for example, evaluate them for university based on book reports that are presented in the form of interpretive dance, for example. We think that that's the kind of creativity that should be allowed in the classroom setting, it should be encouraged in many places in the classroom setting. We think that creativity is great. We think that thinking of different ways to allow students to express themselves and to express the knowledge that they've gained is wonderful, but we think that there's also a place for standardized testing. Why? First of all, we think that we need the data to compare national, and even international, standards of learning, especially in subjects such as math and and sciences, where there are answers that are quite clear-cut and where we need to know who knows this knowledge and who doesn't know this knowledge. We think that when you see a broad picture, it helps us pick out where the weakest schools are, where the weakest school districts are, the states or countries that are at the bottom of the list or nearing the bottom of the list or at the top, so that we can help by increasing funding to teachers, by modifying teaching methods, and other sorts of assistance that we can give these places. So, for example, when we look to standardized testing, when you see consistently from international standardized testing over the years that specific countries have the absolute best results, we think that you can look to those countries and learn from them and say, " what can we do? What can we take from their school systems to make ours better? " We think that there's value in that and the only way to collate that information, be able to then turn to the best school systems and the best learning systems, is to have some form of standardized testing as we think that there is great importance to it in terms of benefiting the weaker schools. We thin, second of all, that standardized testing often often does helped to to pick out those students who excel and the students who need more attention and assistance. We think that even if it's only at a schoolwide level or a school district level or a national level, we think that when you have periodic standardized testing in, you know, once every two years or or or or, you know, different countries it's in different times every two years, every three years in certain grades, we think that that allows teachers to pick up on the students who do have trouble with testing and we think, ladies and gentleman, that it's unfair and it's and it's a little bit naive and irresponsible of the government to say, " well, this just isn't an important skill to have. " It actually is an important skill. It's not the most important skill, but test taking is an important skill to have in life. We think that hard work, learning how to work a system and being able to sit down with a piece of paper and and tick off the right box, we think that that is a skill that often comes up in the workplace, that often comes up throughout our lives, and we think that when we can when when teachers have a way of picking up on the students who have trouble with it, then they can assist those students and they can give them the special attention that they need, and they can refer them for the testing that they need in order to get special allowances, which is also something that we encourage, right? So we think that that it's that we can pick up on the students who need that extra help. So we do think that learning difficulties should obviously be accommodated with special tools such as oral exams, extra time. Those are things that help certain people, but how do you know who needs those that assistance? Only through standardized testing to begin with. So we also think evaluation is important. You need some form of metric to categorize and rank even if we also look at other metrics, which should be encouraged. But you can't say that universities should just choose based on other methods. What are they basing it on, right? Government hasn't given us a a a real concrete alternative. You can't just say that universities should ignore ranking and then what are they basing their answers on and that is why we do not think that standardized testing should be abolished.
We shouldn't introduce recall elections. Two main arguments: first, on implementation impacts. First, I want to address tim's argument on democracy. We think that democracy is fulfilled when people elect the politician to office, in the first place, and then if they lose favor, they won't get reelected, and that would also fulfill democracy in the long term. You don't necessarily have to fulfill democracy by recalling a candidate halfway through, rather you can fulfill it by keeping up with people's changing preferences through elections, which is what we do in the status quo. But more than that, we think that democracy can be outweighed by pragmatics. This is why we don't have an absolute democracy with one person, one vote on every policy, because we recognize that even though this might create the most democratic system, we don't value that if that's also incredibly inefficient and oftentimes counterproductive, because people might not know what they are voting on. This is why we elect representatives to do that job for us. We're willing to compromise absolute democracy because we know that we wouldn't be able to be effective with it. This is similar in this situation where, sure, maybe recall elections are more democratic than the comparative, which is already pretty democratic, but because it introduces such a huge amount of inefficiency into the system, we don't want to do it. I think that tim's model is very problematic because there are very few elections that are won by such a large majority that there aren't twenty percent of the people against them. Being supported by eighty percent of the population is a really big deal for any politician, and the majority of elections are won by much smaller margins. This means that getting twenty percent for a recall vote will be ridiculously easy, even if it isn't successful. This is problematic because even when it doesn't go through, the call for a recall is a powerful signal that creates discomfort and confusion in the population. It seeds distrust in a system that doesn't necessarily deserve it and actively prevents the political system from being able to move on after a harsh election season to get things done by making everyone less accepting of changes and more critical of the administration. It can also literally be used to stall and disrupt politics. If every time a democratic governor does something, the republicans call for a recall, that creates a stop and go situation which is both exhausting to the general populace but also threatens productivity in those political offices. Tim says that the populace isn't vigilant, and that's exactly the problem. It's really easy for fearmongering or bullying to cloud people's understanding, which will then compromise the democratic nature of these recall elections altogether, because you're going to have so many of them, it'll be so hard for people to keep up with them consistently that eventually you're going to have a undemocratic outcome simply because too many people are at work during the recall election, or you have increased apathy because it's been happening so often. Our second argument is about the bad impact it has on politicians. First, we think that they won't take actions for fear of these recall, and this is actually a really big problem, because there are very few policies that have a broad generalizable support. Almost every action is controversial to a minimum twenty percent of the population. If a politician wanted to be beloved by all, all they would do would be to cut taxes by five percent and then sit back and maintain the status quo. Maybe they would, maximum, have some infrastructure spending, but we still need to accomplish change and growth despite limited backlash. So having definitive elections without recall give time for politicians to do what they promised. If they're constantly afraid of a recall, they would be severely limited in terms of what they could do, which would have lasting impact on the population and prevent us from doing things like ever spending money on like social welfare, because this is a controversial topic, or ever doing things like getting rid of pollution or having more regulations on companies, because that's also controversial. Proud to oppose.
We shouldn't introduce recall elections. Two main arguments, first on implementation impacts: first, to address danny's argument on democracy and how impeachment doesn't work, and therefore we need these recall actions as another system that allows the people to take control. Even if it is true that there are bad incentive structures against impeachment, we think that people aren't actually better arbiters, especially since there's tons of apathy, misinformation, and pettiness among the general voting population such that any kind of recall elections would also be influenced by even worse kind of incentives, especially given that you will add to this things like attack advertisements and other kinds of political incentives on the part of politicians that want to create recall actions. And these are influences that you literally cannot have an impeachment. Moreover, I just think it's not true that the people don't have a way of expressing their displeasure with politicians. Maybe it is the case that they can't recall them in the middle of a term, but you just don't reelect them later, which is what danny seems to ignore the entirety of this debate. And I think that at the point that this is true, we don't need to have the ability for people to express their opinion all the time, only at the time when it is most important, and that already exists. It's important to note that very few elections win by such a large majority that there aren't some amount, even a very large amount of people, that are against them. Being supported by by eighty percent of the population even isn't particularly possible, right? Like a lot of our elections are won on like a forty five, fifty five kind of split. And at the point that that's true, it's very easy for those numbers to fluctuate throughout the course of the term such that at any given moment, you could have a majority who don't want that politician in place, even if later in the term, they will again. And I think at the point that these fluctuations happen so often, you can't have recall elections based on these kinds of numbers, because they're just going to happen at arbitrary times, for no particularly good reason, without allowing for the time to pass that would be necessary for the fluctuations to stabilize. We think at the end of the day, getting the percentage vote for a recall vote would be ridiculously easy, even if the ultimate recall isn't successful. And that's really problematic because even when it doesn't go through, the call for a recall is a powerful signal that creates discomfort and confusion in the population. It seeds distrust in a system that doesn't necessarily deserve it and actively prevents the political system from being able to get things done by making everyone less accepting of changes and more critical of the administration. It can also literally be used to stall and disrupt politics. If every time a democratic governor does something, the republicans call for a recall, that creates a stop-go situation which is both exhausting to the general populace, but also threatens productivity. I think at the end of the day, the general population just isn't particularly vigilant. And that's really a problem a problem for them, because it's really easy for fearmongering or bullying to cloud people's understanding, which will compromise the democratic nature of those recall actions. Our second argument is about the bad impact on politicians. Danny spends a while talking about accountability, but we don't think that this will actually have an effect on accountability, because politicians are only not accountable when they physically cannot, and when they are being completely unaccountable and just doing the opposite of what they promised, that's when those individuals don't get reelected. So we're always going to weigh the harmful effect this has on politicians more than the ability for people to actualize their anger, because people do you have the ability to actualize their anger later. We think the problem, more so, is that politicians won't take actions for fear of these recalls. Because they understand that people from outside of their constituency can initiate recalls, they're going to be less likely to follow through on their promises to their own constituency for fear of making people outside of it angry. If a politician wants to be beloved, all they would have to do is something like cut taxes by five percent and then sit back and maintain the status quo, which we thinks become which we think becomes a lot more likely when you introduce recall elections. Proud to oppose.
Government cannot win this debate by simply outlying disadvantages of standardized testing. Obviously it has its downsides, otherwise there isn't a debate. The question is whether on the comparative the alternative is better and the answer is absolutely not. By the way, we didn't even get a sense of what exactly side government thinks that the alternative is going to be. We hear firstly that it's a waste of time because the tests aren't like according to the level of the students. This is an off clash argument because all it says is that we have to improve the tests themselves and allow them to express several levels so that there will be standardized tests for like more advanced and less advanced levels. This is in no way an argument against standardized testing categorically. Obviously the same goes to the point about how the content in these tests are is too basic or too wide, just improve the tests. Then we hear that it's a waste of money. We say that that is a generic point that basically fits every debate and therefore isn't exactly strong. We say that if we show you that there is value to standardized tests, then clearly this is a wise investment. Two arguments coming from us. First, we say that this is the least discriminative tool that we have. Reality is that we need information on how people performing on the skills of people that will be used is that like parameter for comparison in order to screen people. There's no way around this. We say that the demand for universities and then for job places exceeds the supply and therefore we have to screen somehow. It's unlikely that government is going to oppose this. We say that that is a very big part of the reason that we have standardized tests like the SAT for example to begin with. The issue is that if there aren't going to be results of standardized tests, then we would have to allow for a certain like mechanism for in which people like select people on a case-by-case basis. For example, I don't know, private interviews. We say that this is way more dangerous. Why? Because then we are effectively allowing these institutions or the employers to enact certain considerations that don't necessarily have anything to do with the performance of the of the person sitting in front like in front of them and and we have no guarantee that they will not use wrongful considerations such as origin or race or gender or appearance. Note, we don't even have to assume that there is wrongful intent on the part of whoever takes these decisions. It is a proven psychological fact then that when people don't have an objective metric to decide by, they are influenced from several prejudice and stigmas. This means that any type of impact that comes from side government on how standardized tests are discriminatory to the weaker students or to the ones that don't test well, we say that even if it's true to an extent it becomes way worse in their world because at least in today's world there is a chance for the weaker students to work hard and succeed. Tomorrow, all chances are going to be against them without them have having anything to do about this. Second argument, why we prefer the pressure of these tests to the indifference that comes when they don't exist. So, it is true of course that pressure can harm the like the level of functioning but this is not something that's exclusive to these tests. This is a necessary feature of life and society. If we prevent our children from becoming exposed to this stress that that just is a natural part of being compared to other people in a young age, they will simply be exposed to that in a later later stage in life when they compete with others like on it workplaces or when they compete with their colleagues on promotions. So the only difference is, then they will not have the tools to cope with that pressure, so at best we are simply delaying the fall for these people that government wants to protect and making the fall much more painful. On the other hand, when people go to school and they know that there is not going to be any test eventually and that they will just receive some subjective test that is like according accorded to their own level, this endorses indifference and laziness especially today when parents have to when teachers have to compete with instagram and snapchat we say that one of the only things that allow children in school to maintain high motivation to focus and to like really work on their education is knowing that there's going to be a test in which they should do well. We say that once that doesn't happen anymore, we think it's very likely that children's natural tendency to just like get busy with every other thing except for what's being studied in class is only going to become worse. This enhances the problem that already exists in the education system of children that leave school ill informed and poorly educated. Please oppose.
In a world that's becoming more and more global, in which countries stop being the most important player when it comes to trade, and there's a transition to continental trade blocks, or huge economic areas, like the european union, and the african union, and the south american union, a continent that will not follow this trend, will find itself lagging behind. Asean still has a long way to go, but the solution to its problems must be seeking to strengthen it, rather than disbanding it. We hear two things coming from side government. First is that asean has been inefficient. Why? Because it's hard to reach a consensus, because there's a lot of differences between the member countries in terms of culture, and language, and religion, and different priorities, etcetera. We say two things to that. A, all of this is also true in other unions. For instance, in the european union. There are different countries with different histories, different cultures, different languages, and these are very much countries that were having conflicts for centuries, and still we have managed to reach a very successful union. So we say that this cannot be an inherent reason to why asean could never ever work. The second answer is that even if it's inefficient today, this doesn't mean that it's not going to be way worse, like economically, to disband it. We say that it's enough to look at at what happened in britain with the brexit as an example. We say that even if there were some truths to the arguments about how the EU isn't working well for britain, we saw that the that the moment that they decided to pull out, then the economy has suffered an even greater blow. We say that disbandment creates huge uncertainty that harms investments, it harms the stock market, and that's why even if asean is stagnating, we must things think of ways to strengthen and improve it, before we turn to disbandment. And the second argument made by daniel, is that asean excludes other options, such as multilateral or direct negotiations. And he and he seems to think that these are better because they are smaller deals in scope, they're faster to agree upon and negotiate like better terms. Well, two answers here as well. First, we didn't really hear why this excludes like additional options. Like why couldn't we have individual agreements, on top of the asean agreements, between countries, in cases where there's some local specific matter that concerns only two countries. B, of course it's easier, but like you know, the bigger the agreement is the more complicated it is, but it also the more influential. We say that all in all, even if it takes longer and requires more sweat in like to to sign the agreement, this still saves a lot of transaction costs, because we are talking about one big like one big agreement, instead of every country having to go through and engage in ten individual agreements. Moving on to our constructive arguments. We say that asean is also a protector of the regional stability. We mustn't forget that promoting the economy is not the only goal of this union. Much like the european union, asean is also meant to strengthen the cultural ties, that as side government rightfully mentions, are very different, countries with different cultures. So this is meant to bring to bring those countries closer together, and create a unity of interest that will make it that much harder to go to war. And we say that even if, in financial terms, it's hard to see the fruits of asean, then clearly when it comes to peace and stability, it is a success. So for all of these reasons, we call you to oppose this motion.
In this speech I will simply address the three arguments made by side government one by one, and answer them. So the first argument that we hear is about cruelty. They tell us that zoos are cruel to animals, because they are unable to provide the habitat that they are used to in nature, and that's just like keeping people in prison, and it deprives them of their ability to socialize naturally, and so on and so forth. We have two answers to this argument. The first answer is that while we acknowledge that conditions for animals in zoos aren't perfect, it's not all bad. We have to remember that the alternative for these animals is life in the wild, which are also often vicious and cruel, because every day in the jungle is a renewed struggle to survive. You have to hunt your food yourself, and great many animals fail at this and die of hunger. Or you have to be careful not to be hunted and eaten and be used as someone else's food. So, these are all concerns that animals in the zoo don't experience. So on one hand, yes, they are held in captivity, they don't have vast space to move around. But on the other hand, their lives aren't at constant danger. I'm not so sure that that it's such a bad deal. The second response is that even if you don't buy the first one, let's say that the animals do suffer a a great deal. They certainly don't suffer any more that than animals in the food industry do. They certainly don't suffer any more than animals being used for cosmetic experiments. They are certainly not suffering more than animals in the circus. These are all things that humans can survive without, but we don't hear any word about this from the previous speaker. People use animals for entertainments all the time. This was always the case, this always will be the case, and in fact we are okay with this. We we think that we are intellectually and emotionally superior creatures to animals, this is what makes human will and desire more significant. The next points the next argument that they make is that zoos are a bad form of education to whoever visits them. Why? Because this doesn't really raise awareness, this creates some sort of false consciousness, because it doesn't really help out elephants in africa, and there are other things that can do a much better job at this, like conservation parks or national geographic programs. So, we say that obviously zoos are not meant to help extinct elephants in africa, but that doesn't mean that they are not an excellent educational tool for their visitors to learn more about animals, to whoever finds this fascinating. Because there's only so little that you can learn from reading books and watching documentaries, that's an entirely different learning experience from meeting the animal face to face, from being able to actually observe it firsthand. In addition, we don't understand why this is mutually exclusive. Whoever cares about elephants in africa will donate to whatever charity that deals with this problem, and whoever wants to be able to learn more firsthand about panda bears will donate money to the local zoo. We just don't understand where's the harm here. But thirdly, we hear that zoos are a bad way to spend public funds. Why? Because it's better to spend them on schools. We say that this is just a false dichotomy, because we cannot think of every penny spent as a penny that wasn't spent on other things. This line of thinking never ends, because every penny spent on infrastructure wasn't spent on education, and any penny spent on education wasn't spent on health, and any money any penny every penny spent on health wasn't spent on security. That obviously these are all things that the country has to account for. So then james argues that well, the state never spends public funds in order to subsidize other forms of entertainment, but for zoos. This is obviously simply false. Look at parks, look at theaters, look at museums, in fact all of these things are things that the state has to spend public funds to subsidize, because they fall under the category of public goods that the market just isn't able to provide well enough on its own. So because we see that none of the arguments made by side government stand up to scrutiny, we are proud to oppose.
We're going to agree with the side governments that the choice to become a surrogate mother is very difficult and with very serious implications, but that cannot be in itself a good enough reason to deny women that choice. We think that eventually, there is no concrete difference between the decision to become a surrogate mother and many many other difficult decisions that people who face financial hardships are forced to make, and that even side government would never dream of banning. We do not understand why this is inherently different from a single mom that is forced to work in several manual labor jobs for fourteen hours a day, just to be able to bring back food to the table and feed her children. We hear from tim firstly, that women are incapable of fully grasping the risks and implications of pregnancies. Three answers here. First, we do not understand why this is necessarily the case. For many women a surrogacy isn't their first pregnancy, and even if it is, we say that there is a lot of access to information about pregnancies and what they entail in our society. Secondly, we say that gaps of information exist in a lot of other decisions, and -n in employment contracts for instance, in which you agree to something without being able to actually know first hand how how this is going to affect you. We still allow these contract. And thirdly and most importantly, please note that according to this knowledge, according to this logic, sorry, women can simply never or should never get pregnant to begin with, because if a pregnancy is so coercive by nature, then why allow women to endure through it? Now tim's going to tell us that there is no problem of going through a pregnancy, as long as this awards you with a child, because it's worth it. But how can you tell? How can you know up front if the award of raising that child is going to be worth all the harms of pregnancy. At least as long as your reward is financial, then you can evaluate it more precisely and more objectively, and estimate exactly how much these risks are worth to you. Secondly, we hear that women cannot opt out from this contract, and therefore it's like slavery. We we just disagree, we think that in most surrogacy agreements there are clauses that define that define exactly the terms and penalties in cases of breach of contract, just like any other contract. And besides that, slavery is, you know, for life. Where here we are only discussing nine months at the worst case, so even if these are particularly, like, difficult months, we do not think that there's really room for comparison. Next we're being told that surrogacy targets the weakest women in society, and therefore it's unfair. The only problem is that it's unclear to us why the alternative, which is as I mentioned busting your ass, is more fair, because at least when you're a surrogate mom, then all of your medical needs are tended to. You get to see doctors, you get to see your children. Besides, even if we ban surrogacy, clearly what's going to happen is that people will simply look for surrogacy options outside of the states, right? Typically in developing countries where women are even more poor and and miserable, and the chances for a woman, like the risk for a woman and the chances that she will be abused grows a lot more. So government loses the clash of aiding the weak too. So, and eventually we hear about the option of adoption. Now of course that option exists, and obviously we don't have anything against adoption, but for obvious reasons most people prefer to to bring their own child to the world rather than adopt a child. Now it is side government's burden, not only to mention that more people are going to adopt and now everything is going to be wonderful, but to also explain why they think that it's legitimate that same sex couples, or couples that are facing fertility problems, will be forced to adopt, while all of the other couples can simply, like, have children that are their own flesh and blood. This they do not do for a second. And for all of these reasons, opposition wins this debate. Please oppose.
Don't abandon social media. James forgets that the traditional forms of communication and connection he talks about are things like phones and letters, which can work on which can work on a short-term individual level if those people are actively present in each other's lives at the time but are no longer functional once you want to connect with multiple people or want to keep in touch with people who aren't actively present in your life. It is not the case that social media is simply about posting highlights of your life and snooping on others, rather it is about maintaining intricate connections between people across large amounts of distances and long amounts of time. And even if these connections may seem like they are built off of just seeing the highlights of another person's life, we think it is actually much more meaningful when it also means that you can be an active participant in those people's lives, even as you are no longer active participants in each other's lives in reality. And that is something that we think is especially valuable now when people can be so lonely constantly switching jobs, constantly moving areas, but you can maintain these connections that, back then, simply wouldn't have been possible to maintain. James also talks about data collections and sale, but this isn't unique or exclusive to social media. Amazon also data mines and sells that data, as do extensions like honey or wikibuy. You have to be able to evaluate social media outside of the data that they collect or the way in which they keep their services free. This is especially true because we think that individuals can opt out of social media if they so choose. Plenty of people choose not to have a facebook account because there is no world in which a facebook account is necessary for your life, rather it is just that maybe you are someone who prefers to have one because you enjoy it. We also just don't think that things like targeted advertisements are actually that harmful to individuals. Like, at the end of the day, I'd rather see something that is actually relevant to myself rather than just random advertisement for things that I never need. Two main arguments, first on why they are good for societal relations. First, I think it is incredibly important that social media allows you to keep up with people both across distance and across time, because it is often the case that we meet individuals who we like and care about, but these people are transient within our real reality physical lives. And so being able to follow them, into like the rest of their lives, on social media, is really useful, especially since you can maintain things like networking connections, but also just friendships. Like being able to comment on someone's wedding or their baby photos, even when you haven't talked in a while, allows you to maintain connections that otherwise become very awkward, right? Like maybe I've been friends with someone for a while but if I don't see them for ten years and I don't keep up with their lives, it can often be very awkward to reconnect after that time, and facebook and other social media allows that awkwardness to dissipate, because you still have some baseline updates to keep a conversation off of. It's also a better publicization of group events and organization. Like we think it's really nice that it actually organizes what you can do in your area, what your friends are doing, these are things that translate from the internet into reality in a really positive way. James talks about government targeting. We just don't think this is much of an issue, given that people are fairly service level on social media, but also they'll just find a different way to target you, like through your phone calls and such. We also just don't think that the echo chamber radicalizes the way that the way that james says. Like at the end of the day, all of us are in echo chambers, just because we surround ourselves with people who have similar views. Social media might exacerbate that but we don't think it does so to a meaningful extent. Their second argument is about how you have other our second argument is about the other pragmatic goods. We think that it makes it easier to access information. You get more advertising for events, and social gatherings, and charities. You also get a lot better messaging platforms. Like things like message groups vastly originated with facebook messenger, because it was really bulky to do in texts. And plenty of people almost exclusively use facebook messenger because the platform is so much better than regular texting. James is worried that people curate their lives that they put up and maybe this is true, but insofar as everybody is in on that, we don't think that it uniquely affects someone harmfully. Proud to oppose.
Don't further exploit green technology. Look we already use a lot of the technology that james talks about like solar panels etcetera, and exploit suggests that there's further usage than what the market already supports ie exploited above the status quo. We think that if green technology is better than the stuff we've been using before, we think that's something that people are going to latch onto naturally. There are plenty of individuals in the united states who care about the environment and plenty of people who will opt for green tech once it becomes the cheaper option. We just caution against exploiting green technology beyond market demand. With that two main arguments, first on letting the market develop naturally. If we're running out of oil and coal, that's something society will realize either way on our side of the house and will act accordingly. We think that society is tilting towards green technology either way. Global warming impacts are beginning to actualize in ways that people can actually see which is scaring large swaths of the population that were previously nonbelievers who can now see that the sea levels are rising, who can see that weather patterns have become significantly less predictable and that we've had more hurricanes than we've previously had in the last x number of years. There's also been a social shift towards respecting nature more with the rise of hipster and environmentalist movements in pop culture and in start up culture, and there's been significantly more innovation and competition over green technology which has driven prices down. This demonstrates a really good upward trend in terms of the way in terms of in terms of the way that we deal with green technology in society. We think that overexploiting green technology before we hit that point naturally could have a few bad effects. First we think it'll mobilize gas and oil companies to be even more defensive if they see a sudden big push. This means even harder work towards electing specific politicians who would be anti-green technology. It means trying to revamp their efforts at making themselves seem as integral to society as possible, so like the activation of a lot of worker groups that like previously have been fairly quiet but that now will be like no we need the oil jobs even louder. Like these are the kinds of things that these companies can exploit and exacerbate without even trying that hard that in the status quo they don't because they don't feel it as an existential threat, but if efforts were to rise in exploitation of green tech they probably would. Second, the other impact here is that green technology will be pushed out without the proper research and development which means that the market will be flooded with bad products because we're trying to exploit as many as possible, so we're not putting in the time and effort that is actually necessary towards making sure that it's actually good. And we actually think that both of these could prevent us from adopting green technology in the long term by spooking us from going any further with it because either we like fall into the oil and gas companies' kind of like rhetoric or we're just seeing such bad outcomes that people want to kind of rely on the safer options that they've been using all along. Our second argument is about making sure our green technology is actually green. If you buy an old gas guzzler, it's still more environmentally friendly than a brand new tesla because the tesla production process is worse for the environment than than cars that we've had time to make the process of production more efficient for like those gas guzzlers. And when we have this debate we have to consider the net effect on the environment not just the effect of using the product. We come up with more energy efficient production processes by having more time with the product, so we can get the best of both worlds on our side of the house by just waiting longer. This also takes better care of the future people that james is so worried about because it means that those people will get the best form of green tech and the best form of the impact on the environment. For those reasons, proud to oppose.
Side government is devoting the entirety of their speech to showing the damages of algorithmic trading, but what they don't do for a second is offer us an alternative. This system was invented in order to answer a pressing need of the exchange market in executing large trading orders for which there is simply no reasonable alternative, seeing as the markets just cannot support transferring all of it at once. So without receiving any concrete feasible alternative offer from side government, we are forced to assume that they simply rather not allow transactions that exceed a certain limit of size or weight. We therefore think that the world that they wish to create is one where there is a lot more limitations on the market and far more damage to investors, simply because this means that there can be plenty of big deals that might have been mutually beneficial. We are talking about deals that to many people could have could have been like deals of a lifetime, a once in a lifetime deal, and now cannot take place anymore. At this point we believe that opposition has already won this debate, but just in order for it to be all the more certain, let's show what are the governments that side government is warning you from, and understand why they are not as worrying as they think. The first thing that we hear is that algorithmic trading endorses like risky behavior from investors, because they will match their behavior based on the partial information in the market, which will lead to ill-considered risk. The problem is that people take exactly this type of risk all the time. The more experience you have, the more you become aware of all the relevant details that you have to take into consideration. In this case, you could be able to look at the like wider trends and like through time, and not just that at a given situation at a given moment. If you lack experience then yes, you might fall, but this is no different from the status quo of the stock exchange market in which people take risks often based on a gut feeling, or an unprofound rumor, or partial data. So we don't understand what's different with algorithmic trading. Next thing we hear is that this creates a problem of like asymmetry or inequality between big investors and small investors that do not have the means to access algorithmic trading. But again, we just don't understand how is this different from any other situation where whoever has more resources gets an advantage, gets like a competitive advantage. If I am a big investor with a lot of money, then I can afford to like take counsel from the best investment advisers that are in the market, and where like small time investors just cannot afford that. I get better deals from pension funds or from saving funds or from banks. This is just the way that our market operates, and we do not understand why side government is specifically bothered with algorithmic trading. For all of these reasons, we beg you to oppose.
Don't abolish intelligence tests. Both sides are going to agree that intelligence tests shouldn't be used in an official capacity for things like job applications or university applications, but this doesn't mean that they don't have their use in people's private lives or primary education. So we think that when james spends the majority of his speech talking about how this shouldn't be a metric for like whether or not someone gets a job or similar things, we just don't think this is the debate that we're having. Like, of course, we can recognize that something is absurd when used in certain situations but shouldn't be banned across the board, because maybe it's not harmful enough to be banned, and we don't think that james proved that. Also, we think that it's fair for our side to say that we would have a lot of advertising about why intelligence tests are bad metrics and are unreliable. We want the pseudoscience revealed the way it is mostly is in the status quo. James seems to be arguing as though we're still twenty five years behind, thinking that IQ tests are the objective truth. This is just not where we are right now, right? Like, as a society, we have recognized that IQ tests aren't something that is legitimate the vast majority of the time. We have stopped using them in the majority of cases that james talks about. Like I've never seen a job use an IQ test as an actual metric for whether or not someone gets the position. So at the point the majority of his speech is just not applicable to what he wants to debate about, we think he's already lost. But also, james is worried about biases in a intelligence test. And, sure, this is true that sometimes these things are applied unfairly or that IQ tests can be biased against individuals who don't know the language, things like that, but we've already learned that and have seen the change occur. Like the test has literally been redesigned in order to adjust for individuals who are bilingual, and we don't understand why we wouldn't be readjusting and or just recognizing the limitations for individuals who might be from low income housing or individuals who might be people of color. Two main arguments, first on why intelligent tests are just something that is fun. People have fun with puzzles and what the puzzles and maintaining the results for their own pleasure, and we think that at the end of the day, as long as they aren't being used in an official capacity that unfairly hurts people who are otherwise qualified on their own merit, there's really no harm in the existence of intelligence tests. James is wrong about the way that people respond to IQ test results. There's been enough research that shows that intelligence tests are only predictors of potential, not an absolute on whether people will be successful. And people have internalized that truth, right? Like people hear the fact that they are unreliable, we see institutions that aren't using them as often, and we can insofar as people know these things, the way they respond to them are like oftentimes just positive, right? Like for people who are disadvantaged in other ways, like someone from a really poor family who scores high on an IQ test, now has like now uses it as proof that they are capable and are more likely to feel motivated to keep trying. Like we think that oftentimes society places limits on individuals like this. They say, " look, because of your background, you will not be able to achieve, " and they make it significantly more difficult for them to achieve. And we think that having like a high IQ score can motivate people to see that they can be better or have the potential to be better. Alternatively, poor IQ test results can motivate fighting against that result and showing that you are better and more capable. So we really don't think there is a bad response here. Our second argument is about the uses in primary schools. A lot of the time, IQ tests can be used in combination with classroom data to evaluate whether kids should be going into higher level programs or getting remedial help. This is especially important for things like enrichment programs, because they're really something that other kids aren't usually interested in. It can also predict specific areas of weaknesses. So if someone scores really poorly on spatial recognition, it signals to teachers to work more on that with them. Like we agree this is massively a pseudoscience, but we don't think that pseudoscience is always without applications, right? Like we still have things like personality tests because we think that there might be some benefits beside the fact that it's a pseudoscience. Proud to oppose.
The utility to a potential life that is a human because it has the potential to become human, because being a human is about being able to continue to grow as a human, not only does the government not make a lot of sense and rely on total logical statements it's also extremely utilitarian. In a debate that is very emotional. In a situation that is very emotional. You can't always ignore what's going on with the woman just because you prefer to look away and weigh utilitarian costs. There's more to anguish than just well anguish is you know not as bad as death. I'm gonna discuss a few things on my side of the house and through my discussion of the of why partial birth abortions must be allowed I'm also going to oppose what was said on the government side of the house. So first let's address the question when is partial birth abortion actually utilized? Let's put some context into this debate because no woman waits until their second or third trimester to abort a fetus just for fun. On well, I'll just go through five, six, seven months of morning sickness, which is actually all day long sickness, feeling a baby a fetus kicking around inside of me, feeling sick, having emotional ups and downs, growing this fetus inside of me but now it just changed my mind. That is rarely the case. That is almost never the case. What we are talking about are specific types of cases where the mother's at risk either physically or emotionally, or the fetus is at risk, or the mother simply didn't know she was pregnant until it is too late to have any other kind of abortion. We think, and that is often in the case of teen pregnancies, we think these are all that these all give us a little bit more contextual understanding of who this woman is standing in front of us. This is somebody who who has I mean the anguish of having a parasite inside your womb, kicking you from within, that it's not something that can simply be disregarded and said well death is worse. You know what, death is not what we're talking about here. Partial birth abortion is the termination of a pack of cells. It's not a life. It might be a potential life but it's not a life yet. Right now, and this brings me to my second point, a fetus is simply a parasite inside the woman's body and the woman is the one with bodily autonomy. She must have complete autonomy over her body and that means up until the very minute that the parasite is out of her, that the fetus is out of her, she should have complete control over what happens to it. Until the fetus is delivered they the fetus is totally reliant on the woman's body. It is a parasite. It is her decision. Fetuses literally suck calcium from a woman's bones, they steal nutrients, they abuse the mother's body from within. It has to be a women's choice to terminate the pregnancy at any stage throughout especially bearing in mind that it's rarely that it's really done outside of very extreme circumstances. We say this idea that like it's clear the fetus would be able to survive at this point. We say, first of all, it's not clear at all. There's a good reason why it's inside the womb for nine months. It needs those nutrients. It needs that protective atmosphere in order to to grow and develop and it's a very it's not clear at all that a fetus would survive earlier than in eight through nine month birth but second of all to what end are we talking about here? Right like if we can grow a fetus outside of the womb completely, does that mean that women will never be allowed to have an abortion, will never be able to decide actually this was a mistake I took I I took protective measures, or I was raped or whatever it is, and they won't be allowed to won't be allowed to terminate at all? What about men masturbating? Is that going to be not allowed because you'll be able to facilitate out of the womb out of the womb conception? We think that these are things that you need to take into account when you're talking about this life. The fact is that the only way we can determine life is once it is actually independent in and of itself, before that, the woman must have bodily autonomy.
We should not subsidize embryonic stem cell research. So, in this round, we're not going to try and argue that stem cell research doesn't have positive medical impacts that it is likely to yield, nor are we really going to argue about the ethics of stem cell research. We think it is certainly debatable whether or not stem cell research is an ethical practice, but we don't think that that is necessary to show why we shouldn't subsidize stem cell research. Instead, we're going to provide three arguments that will directly clash with the arguments that we get out of the government side. So, the first argument that we would make is that there's simply sufficient funding, in the status quo, from private investors, when when we're talking about embryonic stem cell research. So the government side tries to preempt this by giving a sort of blippy remark that there's a lot of public outcry and public stigma about stem cell research, which we're going to touch on later, but that this essentially turns off investment from private investors. We don't think that that is really the case. First and foremost, most of these private investors, these big firms, aren't really visible to the public anyway. They're not, you know, these types of funds aren't in the public spotlight all that frequently, but more and so we think there's not really a a public stigma. But more importantly, look at all of the benefits of research that the government the government themselves gives to us: the potential to to cure most conditions that currently face individuals, the improvement to the economy if individuals are less likely to be sick and less likely to be harmed. This is why there is a huge earning potential for anyone that is willing to invest in embryonic stem cell research. And it's much more it's much less risky than other types of research, because we already sort of understand the potential benefits that can be unlocked and we understand the science behind why it's the case. So it's less of a gamble than other scientific ventures that is likely to yield a very high return, which is why even if there is a public stigma, like the government side says, we think it's much more likely that investors are going to be willing to overcome that and line up to in order to to put their money behind something that could be incredibly beneficial. And the second thing to point out about this is that if all of these benefits are true that the government side is saying, we think all that you're doing in a subsidized, in a system in which you subsidize this research, is you put government money into private individuals, and then you let them take the return from that private from that public investment and use it to make themselves richer. Because who is the government realistically going to subsidize here? They're going to subsidize the corporations and the the big pharmaceutical companies that the government side is so quick to decry. And maybe this will make the drugs marginally less expensive, but we already put so much funding into big pharma so much public funding that we think it's unrealistic to think that suddenly they're going to change their tune and not drive and not make these these sort of treatments incredibly costly. So at the end of the day, we think that there's just going to be funding for this and that in the world in which the government does provide a subsidy for this, you're just coating the pockets of those that are already wealthy. The second point that the government side makes is about ethics, but we actually don't think ethics the ethics of this is all that important, just public opinion. Because recognize, while the government may seem like big brother at times, in a democratic state, the people's money, which is what this subsidy would be coming from, from tax revenue, from tax money, the people's money should be the way that it's going to be spent should be decided by the people. Everyone worked hard, everyone paid in their fair share, and if that's the case, we think that given that stem cell research is incredibly controversial, it's something that a large portion of the public doesn't want to have happen and doesn't care for, we think that in that case, while the government may know best, while the government may be making a wise investment that could improve public health, it's not the government's authority to decide how to spend that money. It is, instead, authority that can only be gained by the people, and the people clearly don't want this. For these reasons, we should not subsidize embryonic stem cell research.
Two things we're gonna discuss in this debate. One, why water fluoridation is unnecessary, and two, how water fluoridation is harmful by perpetuating similar narratives to those of vaccinations. Now to be clear: we do not oppose vaccinations. We think vaccinations are extremely important because of the positives they create. We simply don't think water fluoridation has similar positives. We think though that they've created a dangerous narrative that water fluoridation is perpetuating, and end of the day means that things like water fluoridation means fewer people are also getting vaccinated. We'll get to that. Two points of rebuttal before we start. One, notice the comparative in tim's speech is that there is no harm. As soon as there is a harm, he himself admits that the positive is a, unknown and b, probably minimal. So it means that it's likely to fall on our side of the house. But, we're not entirely sure why he claims there's no harm. I mean at the very least he should have compared against a cost of three three hundred over three hundred million dollars per year and it seems strange to us that he decided not to do that. Secondly he says: " look, this is the job of the government. " This brings us into the into the arguments. We're not entirely sure what claiming this is the job of the government does in a debate that's talking about whether or not this brings more harm, good than harm or not. Crucially, however, notice that there's an intervention of government in bodily autonomy that is seen as disruptive even when it isn't. Let's get to that in the argument. First, why is this unnecessary? Topical treatments exist and are of widespread use in all of the countries that create fluoridation. So what does this mean? A, it means that more often than not people drink bottled water which they can choose whether or not they want fluoridated bottled water and b, most importantly, people brush their teeth every day, they go to the dentist everyday, they drink milk every day whether in their coffee or in their cereal or just as a cup of milk. All of this means that in the western world where fluoridation is prevalent people are getting fluoridation for their teeth anyway. That means likely water fluoridation is over fluoridating. We agree that doesn't have any major negative impacts in and of itself but it also means that it doesn't have any particular gains. Why is this so harmful? Particularly a government intervention in bodily autonomy is seen as threatening to people. This is why for example when the government hands out free healthcare education free healthcare, most people think of that as nice. When the government hands out free condoms, for example, other than religious opposition to condoms, most people think of it as reasonable. However, at the point at which the government forces you into bodily changes, most people do not appreciate it. What does that mean? It means nobody would think it was okay if the government forced you into an abortion for example. Right? This would continue to be true even if tim got up here and analyzed why there's a hundred percent sure security that this abortion is good for this person. Because people tend to believe that it is their right to do as they please with their body. This is why you have such a large anti vax community saying that vaccinations are harmful for you. Because at the moment at which the government says: " we will force an external thing into your body ", you get conspiracy theorists telling you that it's harmful. Now this already exists with fluoridation. By perpetuating this notion you create a situation in which more people are opposed to the government as a whole and fearful of it. More people are not vaccinating their children because they think the government is trying to poison them and more people disrespect science and the scientific process. All of this creates far more harm than the minimal two people who otherwise would not have brushed their teeth and therefore gotten fluoride. Please oppose the motion.
We should not close the guantanamo bay facility in cuba. I'm going to argue, first, that there are pragmatic needs for guantanamo to remain open, and then I'll argue why the alternative is worse, and I'll have some rebuttal to rachel's arguments integrated into my speech. So, first, why is it pragmatically necessary that we keep guantanamo bay open? We would argue, first of all, that we cannot repatriate the people who live there, right? Presumably, if we let these people out of guantanamo bay, we're going to have to return them to their home countries. The reason why is that there's no way to bring these criminals to the united states. Barack obama tried several years ago, and the governors of states that were meant to receive them all refused to allow them to be interned in their home states. So there's no way that these people can be imprisoned in the united states proper. That's why they're being held in cuba right now. But then we also can't return most of these people to their home countries. There are two reasons why. First of all, in some cases, their home countries would probably execute them and treat them very inhumanely in a way that's unacceptable or, alternatively, because their home countries would immediately allow them to continue the activities that led them to being put into guantanamo bay in the first place. Right? It wouldn't be very responsible to return people who are going to be beheaded or who are going to be put back in charge of a terrorist cell. So, ultimately, we just don't think that, pragmatically, there's any real solution to this problem. I don't think there's anyone who wants guantanamo bay to continue, especially after all of the abuses that happened there in the mid two thousands, but because rachel can't give us a real alternative solution that's pragmatic, I don't think that there's any way that we can actually close guantanamo bay. Rachel gives you a lot of analysis about how guantanamo bay flies in the face of american and international law but at the end of the day, the law cannot be a substitute for practical solutions to people's problems, right? Sometimes we can't behave in the way society would like us to because there's no way to actually obey the law. In this instance, we can see that it would be contrary to the principles of international law, at least, to allow people to be terrorists or to allow people to be brutally murdered. Secondly, we would argue that the alternatives that do exist are actually much worse. So we think that given that we would have to close guantanamo bay and we can't return these people to their home countries, we would have to transfer them to other US government sites. There are many so-called black sites around the world. The name comes from the fact that these sites are carefully hidden, that the american people don't know about them, that much of the civilian leadership of the US government doesn't know about them, and that no one really knows what happens inside them. I believe a few years ago, edward snowden revealed the existence of a few of them, including some in poland. So if you release people, " release " in quotes here, from guantanamo bay, most of them are probably going to end up in sites like this one. Why is that worse than the status quo? Well, first of all, we tell you that the treatment these people receive could be much worse in CIA black sites than it would be in guantanamo bay. First of all, we tell you that guantanamo bay and its officers are subject to the military justice system, so there is some check on their behavior, whereas the CIA has essentially no check when operating abroad, and secondly, because the public scrutiny on guantanamo bay prevents the worst types of abuses from recurring. We think that if the types of abuse that occurred during the mid two thousands were to happen again that there would be a huge outcry. So, at the very least, there's a check on those abuses in guantanamo bay that would not exist in these black sites. So closing guantanamo bay would actually be worse for the people who are interned there, whom rachel seems very keen to help with her proposal to close it. For all these reasons, we should not close guantanamo bay. Thank you.
Note: this is important. It isn't opposition's burden in this debate to come up with a better alternative, merely to show that the affordable care act has brought more harm than good. Therefore, we are just simply going to go over the three arguments presented by side proposition, and we're going to force them to deal with reality, a reality that, all by itself, refutes all of the arguments that they present. So firstly, they tell us that the that the right for medical treatment should be a basic right for every citizen, and it's a problem to like and and private insurance, like private medical insurance, is a problem because it leaves out some of the people, not providing them with their basic rights. Now we could argue on whether or not the right for medical treatment ease is a basic right, we don't think that's explained in any way by the government, that's merely assumed, but we say that we don't need to. Because even if it were a basic right of the citizens, we would still ask why is it the responsibility of the states to provide that? This is not something that automatically follows. We say that people have a right for warm clothes during wintertime, right? But that doesn't mean that the government or the state is responsible to provide these these clothes to the citizens. But even if it were the state's role, this is an even if on an even if, we say that, surely, not at any not at any price, not at any cost. And we would still have to ask ourselves how much is this goal worth to us, and is this the best way of achieving it? Now, obamacare is expensive, very, very expensive. The data speak about a cost of over a trillion dollars in the upcoming decade. This is going to cause the country's debt, which is already huge, to drastically rise, and this is a major cause for concern. We have heard nothing about that from side government. Then they tell us: don't worry, obamacare still rests on the logic of the private market. It only makes it affordable for almost everybody, and so americans are still able to stomach it without calling it socialism. Well, yeah, ha, we see how well that worked. Wake up, government. This bill has stood in the heart of controversy and the heart of disagreement between democrats and republicans probably more than anything else in american politics, so we don't know what they're talking about. Next they tell us that the biggest problem with being poor is that you need help and there's nobody to help you. And and they say that that like obamacare somehow gives bigger bargaining power for the weakest people, and so they get better medical conditions or whatever. Well, reports show that the lines, the waiting lines, for emergency rooms have gone up drastically since obamacare. And this happens because less and less doctors are now willing to accept medicaid patients without, like, because they want to avoid all of the bureaucracy and all of the unrewarded extra work. And so they just turn patients away to emergency rooms and so, the supply drops while the demand drastically rises, and people have to wait a lot longer in line. Now this may sound petty, but it's not. Longer lines for emergency rooms means that people are dying. And lastly, they tell us that the thing with medical insurance is that I will be willing to to like pay any sum of money for it. There's no cost high enough in order to save my own life, and this is why we see that the costs of medicare keep going up year after year. And they say that the affordable care act sets a like set price and forces the rest of the private companies to, you know, to be somewhere around that price. To which we just answer: on what set price are they talking about? Premiums are higher than ever before with obamacare, if not like they are they're higher than most, if not all, other countries in the world, and there are constantly rising deductibles also are on the rise, which is how much, you know, self-participation you need to to put in. This is consistently rising. Now, I don't even have to present you with an elaborate economic argument, I just have the benefit of hindsight in this debate, and we simply see that reality doesn't fit what government side are saying. So for all of these reasons, please oppose.
Just to be clear, I'm not going to argue that it's wrong to help preserve endangered animals or plants. I don't think that we need to like spitefully push for their extinction. I'm not a bad person. But I will oppose the notion that says, that we have some some form of obligation to do this, or that we should do this also at like the expenses, that are relatively high to our own objectives as a species. So first, the previous speaker talks about a moral obligation that we have towards plants and animals, because we are somehow directly or indirectly responsible for their extinction. So, I think that we need to distinguish between plants and animals in this regard. So firstly, I think that there's something very weird in saying, that we have some form of obligation, a moral obligation, whatsoever towards plants, because this position implies that plants have a moral status, that we are obligated to be concerned with, and we say, that a moral status is derived from the ability to be happy or miserable. Being moral means acknowledging the wishes of others, and taking them into account. But plants quite positively don't have wishes, or the capacity to be happy, or to suffer. They don't have a brain, no nervous system, their life is of a significantly less developed form than ours. So because of this, we don't think that it's possible to win this debate on ethical considerations towards plants. With animals it's slightly different. I do acknowledge that animals have a moral standing, not like plants, and that that we might have certain obligations that we need to consider towards them. And so, in this case, I think that the question is what happens, when our agenda conflicts with theirs. Again, I'm not in favor of actively pushing towards extinction, and as long as it really doesn't cost us much resources, or doesn't come at the expense of our own plans, then we don't have a a like disagreement, but where the cost is high, like having, for example, to forego on plans to establish a whole new village that's desperately needed, due to like overpopulation, where a forest now stands, where the last monkeys of their kind resides, or something like this, or perhaps refraining from fishing, because of some danger to a certain type of fish, in a place where fishing is both the main source of nutrition and income of the people. These are the tough questions in this debate, and in in these cases we prefer to prioritize the needs of humans, just as we are fully certain that the animals would choose to favor themselves over us, where it up to them. Next, we we hear the previous speaker talk about our interests too like, our own interest in preserving species, because there's a lot that we can learn from every type of of plant, or of of an animal, and of course my favorite argument on the circle of life, and how one extinction creates a chain reaction, that leads to more extinctions and so on. Here is my answer: first, we need to understand that there are millions upon millions of different species in the world. There's like a hundred and something different types of jellyfish, and several thousand species of olives, and every single day some of them are going extinct, simply due to evolution. So, you know, the logic that says that every species that goes extinct is a horrible waste, and that we must strive to save them all, it's just unrealistic. But secondly, evolution is actually a key term here, because what it does is make sure that each function, that is actually valuable, and is that's worth preserving, is actually preserved. The species that are going extinct are those, that weren't able to develop apt traits, that are needed for survival, and therefore haya can rest assured that we have enough new species to explore, and that the ones that do remain are the important ones. Please oppose.
We should not raise the corporate tax. So, the round is defined by the government as a comparative of a progressive tax increase over current rates on corporations based on their size, their earnings, etcetera. So the first argument that they make is essentially a principled justification for why raising the corporate tax is good, and their argument is that corporations have money because essentially a force forcible capitalist oppression that creates a system in which money is basically funneled to corporations at the expense of the individual and that corporations create harm because of their actions. So, the first argument the first response to this is that something in order for something to be unjust and oppressive and coercive, you need to look at it in a comparative context. So I'm not sure what system the government side would prefer to the capitalist system we have now in which you have essentially free markets but with protections for workers' security and workers' well-being, with certain price regulation to ensure that the average person is at least able to afford what they what they need with welfare systems, but still a system that allows for essentially free individuals to make choices about how they're going to spend their money, what they want to do with their well-being, with their livelihoods, with their productive capacity, and allows people to be entrepreneurial and gain benefits for themselves through things like hard work. We think that the free market is essentially a pretty good system that's better than the alternatives that have been shown throughout history, and so we think that it is justified and that the idea of this being an oppressive system justifying that ends does not in any way mean that the, first, that the current tax rate needs to be higher, maybe it is just fine where it is, but also I just don't think that all corporations are the drain on society that the government side tries to present them as. They provide jobs, they provide goods that people like to consume, and just because apple is making iphones and iphones don't feed people doesn't mean that apple isn't providing something productive to the world. They say that corporations also create political abuse and that this political abuse justifies taking their money. This political abuse is coming in the forms of legal action, and just because this legal action has an impact on political ends doesn't mean that that justifies essentially increased theft through the form of taxation, and also this doesn't really impact that issue. Like whether or not you have an increased corporate tax doesn't change any sort of political abuse that the government perceives. They then kind of repeat this and say the marginal utility of a dollar is greater for poor people and you have enough money either way. We don't think that this is the case. Corporations always want to increase their margins for their taxpayers, for their for their shareholders, for their board, for all people involved. And if you increase corporate tax rates, this harms their margins. This makes them look bad, this makes their this makes it look bad to their shareholders, and we think they're going to want to maintain and increase their margins, which leads to a few outcomes of higher tax rates. One could be layoffs that leave more people unemployed. Another could be just exporting jobs altogether to a a country that has lower corporate tax rates. And the third possibility is increasing prices, which impacts all consumers. So we don't think it's enough to say that the marginal utility of a dollar is greater for poor people than it is for these corporations when there are a number of different impacts that come from taking that dollar that ultimately all get passed down to the individuals that the government side is most concerned about. And given that this is the case, we have found an equilibrium now where the corporate tax rate exists but doesn't create these market harms, and we don't think that increasing it will do much good. The final argument they make is that rich people essentially, just repeating the fact that if you give this money to the government, you can vest it on other things that help more people. First, see our argument above about why this creates more market harms, but second, the government can do a whole lot of things that impede on freedom but would create more quote unquote utility, but this creates tyranny which we find to be unjustified. For these reasons, we should not raise the corporate tax.
I stand in firm opposition to the motion we should limit natural resource exploitation. The amount that we use our natural resources is essential for us to maintain the progress which has allowed us to live an incredibly good quality of life. The reason that we see violence going down, poverty decreasing, starvation going down, is as a result of our natural resource exploitation. It's a result of the way that our markets are able to use our natural resources to change into goods that empower all of us. Ultimately, limiting natural resource exploitation would do little more than make it so environmentalists are happy while the poor continue to suffer and continue to starve as a result of our callousness and as are a result of our inability to separate ourselves from our own elitism. With that in mind I have two arguments: first is about progress. Why do we think that national resources are so important for progress? They are the inputs which drive capital. Whenever we have any system of capitalism there must be some basic goods that have inherent worth. We think things like gold, wood, oar, are all essential because they can be changed into so many different things and there will always be demand for them. If we were to decrease the very basis of our economy, that is to say the natural resources which drive everything a few things would happen. First, prices for everything would go up. It might seem unintuitive. Why would the price of food go up if the price of gold increased? But the cost of producing microchips to control agricultural systems would increase. The cost of getting steel to be able to build systems of agriculture would increase. The cost of cars and the cost of gas would also increase which would all translate to more expensive food. Don't just think about food though, think about literally every single item in our economy. The result of decreased natural resource exploitation would be total economic collapse. The result then would be that our market has no capacity to recover and that many individuals will lead a far worse quality of life. We think that were the market to be more free, were we to increase our natural resource exploitation while also increasing our investment into RAnd_d, the result is one which the market would have the capacity to solve our natural resource issues, the fact that we don't have enough. We think things like synthetic materials which are as hard as steel are a great replacement however, if we don't continue to invest into our market, if we don't continue to invest into our technology, result is one which the market can never solve our woes. My second argument is that so many lives will be lost. Just think of what happens when the price of food doubles. A lot of people can barely put food on the table in the status quo and either go hungry or simply cannot pay their bills in any meaningful fashion. The result then, if we decrease our natural resource exploitation is that these people will lose their lives. Think that they have some sort of claim to life under any system but were we to preference the general good of the environment over the lives lost as a result of the money that we lose, we think that we we are doing a true disservice to the poor. It is essentially another elitist policy passed by the united states with no deference, with no consideration of those who are the most vulnerable. Ultimately, we think that life is a facillatory right. That's to say, if you don't have life you have no access to any other right. So if we allow thousands of people to die and get a slightly better environment, the result is one which these people simply can't enjoy it and all the benefits of the environment are clearly outweighed by the lives lost. For this reason, we should not limit natural resource exploitation.
Casinos should not be banned. In this round the government side has tried to paint for you this idea that people need to be protected from their worst urges, that casinos are all around bad for almost everyone that enters them and that at the end of the day, the government should just make this decision that we will never have casinos. We think that that is a flawed representation of how the government should behave and is also a flawed representation of how people feel. The first argument they make is that casinos are a coercive business model, that they mislead people about the odds that they will win, that people lack information about the true odds at the roulette table or other types of gambling and that because of this, they can't make rational decisions. First and foremost, this information is not only widely available to anyone that wants to look for it. Like if you do a google search for is like are the casino games fair, what are my odds of winning at the roulette table, these types of things, it's blatantly obvious that these are not games that you are likely to win and most people, the vast majority of people that go into the casino know that this is the case. So we don't think that this is actually an instance of asymmetry of information, but rather it's grown adults making the decision for themselves that they want to take that risk and when they have their hard earned money and they've decided that this is how they want to spend that money just because it's not the decision that the government side would make doesn't mean that the government needs to intervene and make this decision for them. We think rather the government should be maximizing the freedom of individuals to do what they want within their borders and just to highlight one more thing they say this is coercive. There's no one coercing people to go into the casino. Maybe they just want to have the thrill of the game. Maybe they just want to go and enjoy this thing for a brief amount of time for example the only time I've ever gone to a casino I brought twenty I brought twenty dollars with me and I said " I'm probably gonna walk out at the end of the night with none of this money ". Lo and behold I walked out with none of that money but I enjoyed the experience of being at the casino nonetheless. So it's not like people go in there with the expectation of making a ton of money nor do they nor they unaware of the fact that casinos to be profitable, which they clearly are because they're open, need to win more than they lose. So because of that, we don't think that this is coercive. We don't think there's an asymmetry of information. Second, they say this is bad for the communities that host these casinos, that they don't actually spread the tourism money that comes from casinos because most people just stay at the casino. We won't deny that this is the case but we would say that you should allow locales to make this decision on the individual basis rather than having a blanket ban. Maybe it's the case that in certain areas casinos can be profitable for the communities around them like las vegas, like atlantic city. These are areas that are built around the casino business and so clearly having casinos in these areas is not bad for the overall community but certainly in some instances they will be bad and in those instances we think that locales are informed enough to make the decision for themselves about whether or not to have the casino. They say that this brings an unsavory action like prostitution and organized crime. We just don't think that if these actions are taking place in a legal manner in the casinos that they're that bad and frankly, prostitution should be legal. The final argument they make is that the alternative the alternative world, the government world, has less gambling and that gambling is addictive to many people. But the fact that gambling is addictive to some people doesn't mean that you should strip the autonomy of the whole because of these few people and frankly people that are addicted to gambling or could be addicted to gambling can still play the lottery, they can still play poker with their friends, they can still do things to gamble in either world but we think that the autonomy of people to go to casinos, the free market to open a casino and the decision of locales to have a casino should be upheld. For these reasons, casinos should not be banned.
We should not ban homeopathic medicine. In my speech I'm going to explain first, why there's no positive need to ban homeopathic medicine and secondly, why I don't think that the standards for paternalism that sam brings up actually hold true in this case. So first, I think that the biggest problem with the other side of this debate is that there are very few actual harms to homeopathic medicine. Yes it's true that this doesn't really do anything it claims to do, diluting something in water doesn't magically give that water certain properties but at the end of the day, lots of people take it because it makes them feel better because of the placebo effect. We don't think that there's anything fundamentally wrong with this especially because people are not using this to replace real medicine. People don't rely on homeopathic medicine as a supplement or as a substitute I should say for other types of medicine. They use it as a supplement for things like the common cold where there's no cure anyway, or for allergies that are fairly minor. We just don't see what the actual harm is to people continuing to use these drugs. If it makes people happy and it's not hurting anyone else, more on that in just a minute, we just don't see why there's a need to ban this. So I think sam needs to do a lot more work to explain to you why this is actually harmful and just to get ahead of that so that he can come back and say that sometimes these drugs aren't regulated by the food and drug administration, they actually are still held to the same standards as other types of food or drink sold in the united states. So in fact these are safe to consume because they're water, there's nothing else to them and then the second point I'd like to talk about is the standard for paternalism. So the biggest thing I'd like to talk about here is why the information asymmetry sam mentions doesn't matter. Sam is correct that there's an information asymmetry. That the people using homeopathic medicine must not know that it doesn't do anything and that they're wasting their money but the mere fact that this exists isn't actually a problem. Why? No critical information that would harm people is being withheld by these by the manufacturers. It's not as though they're selling poison and telling people that it's medicine. They're just something very expensive water. I think if you want to go after homeopathic drug or makers maybe you need to go after the people who make voss and fiji water after this, it's very similar. So in fact there's no harm being done by this so called information asymmetry and the information being withheld is not that important to people's lives. So I just don't think that this is a sufficient reason to ban these products. Secondly, on third party harms. I think the most compelling point sam gives you in favor of banning homeopathic drugs is that there are harms to third parties. The problem is that this just isn't true. Why? First of all, parents aren't just going to start taking their kids to the doctor because you ban homeopathic drugs. So the comparative world isn't any better than the world we live in. But secondly, I don't think that there actually are third party harms. The types of conditions that people use homeopathic medicines for tend to be very minor or things for which there is no cure. So at that point there's no real harm being done to children or elderly people who are given these homeopathic drugs by a caretaker. The last thing that sam talks about is this power imbalance and how the government is the only actor that is able to make this decision. But I don't think there actually is a huge power imbalance between the consumers and the producers in this particular instance. Why? Well first of all because consumers don't need this. The demand is very elastic so they do have a lot of control over the producers and secondly, because this is a luxury good that just doesn't really matter to most people's lives. So for all of these reasons, we should not ban homeopathic medicine. Thank you.
So we're going to have two arguments: first, on the right of the state to intervene in education and second, on what's going to be the likely outcome of implementing the school voucher system. Before we'll get to these arguments, less let's address and rebut the two arguments made by side government. So, first, they speak about the maximization of choice, right? Like the status quo limits the choice of the parents to which kind of education they want to send their children off to, and it's not an interest of the states if I want to send my child to a catholic school. We are going to engage directly with this point in our first argument. The next thing that they say is that schools are going to become more diverse than in the status quo. They tell us that people choose to live with their group of equals and , only by implementing the voucher system, we're going to get more integration of children from different social groups, and this will increase empathy from a young age and and , you know, we really don't think that this is going to be the likely outcome of this move, and we're going to explain why in the second argument. So, most of the rebuttal is going to be inside the arguments. Let's move on to the constructive. First, on the right of the state to intervene in education. So we think that the education system is a very unique institute in the sense that this is the only period of time in which everyone, like all the citizens in a in a certain age and in we're even talking about future citizens, which is even more important, get to sit for a few hours every day in the same sort of framework and get to listen to pretty much the same content. There is no other stage in life where this happens. This means that this is a one-time opportunity for the state to pass on and to form a collective mutual ground, a shared narrative in a sense. The state treats the education system, sorry, side government treats the education system as if the only function that it comes to serve is things like algebra or geometry, you know, giving you tools to succeed in your future. We think that it's it goes way beyond that. Rather, you know, classes like history history classes and literature and and citizenship, we think these are the most important classes because they create the shared basis of collective knowledge, the normative system, which is the core foundation of society. Without having this shared basis that creates a mutual language between citizens of different groups in society, we are going to have a society that's devastatingly divided, with no way of bridging those gaps. Zero social cohesion. This has very high costs, both politically speaking, economically speaking, even even security-wise. So, this is why the state has a great deal of interest in education, and as long as the state is the one that funds education, which is something that the voucher system insist on preserving, it seems fairly obvious to us that it also has the right to set the tone and to decide on the content that is being passed on to the future generation. Now, note, that this is in direct engagement to the first argument of the side of side government, and in order to explain why we think this ability of the state disappears once we adopt the voucher system, let's move on to the second argument: what's what would likely happen? So we think that this semi-privatization is going to create a competition between schools that is going to be based mainly on content and material of the study program. This is the only way in which schools can really distinguish themselves from other schools. This means that the focus on history lessons or religious lessons or citizenship classes are going to be very different from one another which will create, in all likelihood, the further alienation of different groups in society. Why? Because, like james himself explained to us, people tend to favor their equal group. So if they're catholic, they will send their children off to catholic schools, which will teach one story. In protestant schools, the children are going to be taught a different story. In muslim schools, a third story, in jewish schools, a fourth story, latin schools, fifth story, in afro-american schools, a sixth story. This is exactly the opposite of the the diversity that side government speaks about. This is the end of the american story as we know it. So for all these reasons, please oppose.
We should not further exploit small modular reactors. Contrary to what tim told you, we think that this would be bad for two reasons: one, that it's actually not a good fuel source, which will clash with what tim tells you about energy, and secondly, because of the risks it has for nuclear proliferation. So, first, why is this not a good fuel source? Tim tells you that small modular reactors are an effective fuel source because they can be used in areas where solar power and other types of alternative energy aren't practical and because it's very clean. We're going to argue that solar power is almost always better than small modular reactors. Solar power has gotten much more efficient now than it was even five years ago. It was once the case that only exceptionally sunny places, like california, might be able to use solar power but today, even perpetually dreary places like england can also use solar power, because the panels have gotten much more effective. And what's more, as battery technology has gotten better, we don't have to worry now about long nights in the wintertime or cloudy days that make solar power ineffective. Tim tells you that there are areas where it would be better to have small modular reactors, but we would argue that the main reason why this isn't the case is that they consume so many resources to create and set up. The process of mining and refining uranium, and then of building and establishing safe reactors, and then, most importantly, of storing their waste, ultimately means that this is a very dirty process. Even if the energy that they produce has no emissions, which is certainly true, we think that the secondary cost of establishing them as a way to produce fuel is actually not very green at all. Indeed, many studies show that natural gas can actually be less harmful to the environment than building new nuclear reactors. So we think that maybe these areas where solar power really isn't an option should just continue to use legacy fossil fuel infrastructure until we have a better alternative than nuclear power or existing solar power. We think that it's important that we consider the secondary costs, because they're a major factor in setting up these new modular reactors and make them an ineffective technology to adopt, even if we might keep using them where they exist now until the end of their lifetime. Our second argument is about the risks of nuclear proliferation. Almost every country in the world right now is party to an international treaty not to proliferate nuclear technology. The reason why it is that it's seen that countries that have access to nuclear weapons pose an existential threat to the rest of humanity. And you might say, " well, nobody's going to build the next atom bomb out of a small modular reactor, " and that's true, but dirty bombs are actually one of the biggest concerns for security specialists today. These are weapons that might use a conventional explosive, like a plastic explosive, for the actual bomb, but they contain nuclear material so that they spread radiation and give lots of people radiation sickness and make an area unsafe. So you don't have to be able to build a full-size nuclear warhead in order to create a nuclear weapon, you just need enough radioactive material to poison tens or hundreds of thousands of people, and a small modular reactor could certainly give someone that. We think that by their very size and the fact that they're built to be used in less protected areas, these are particularly vulnerable to being captured by non-state elements or by rogue elements in weaker states. So, in other words, the threat of al qaeda or someone getting their hands on a small modular reactor is much greater than a traditional reactor. For all these reasons, we should not further exploit this technology. Thank you.
We shouldn't abolish term limits. Danny says that it's good to have someone in power for more than one term, and we're fine with that, but what we're not saying is that we're not saying that you have to change out every term. Like we think that we're fine with term limits of two or three or four terms and we're fine with that it's just about having an end point that danny doesn't have. We also think that the chance that you might have an election during wartime isn't worth compromising democracy as a whole since this just doesn't happen very often, but also you can have emergency protocols that extend someone's term until the conflict calms down. Like we just think that all of the situations that danny comes up with in which having someone in power for multiple terms beyond the limit is beneficial are context dependent rare situations that we can adjust for as necessary. This debate shouldn't be about one time situation necessities, rather it should be about the broad principle of whether or not we think that term limits are a good idea and we think that they are. Two main arguments, first on promoting democracy. Democracy is about letting the individuals in a country have an active voice in the representatives that politically impact them. And on face this might look like not having term limits in order to maximize choice as danny says, but he forgets that having incumbents rerun ad infinitum pushes out other candidates and often results in individuals having less choices in the long term. It also allows incumbents to accumulate money from special interest groups and gather connections within politics that often make them turn towards representing special interests more than they represent the people. And this is really bad because it means that the populace isn't actually being served. The people that they're electing aren't working in their best interest and it is not the case that they are actually being like appreciated or listened to within the democracy. We're fine with compromising one aspect of democracy on the mechanical level in order to maximize democracy on the impact level ie sure maybe this is undemocratic just like technically and definitionaly but insofar as it achieves more democratic impacts and allowing individuals to actually choose people who are working for their interests rather than for special interests than we think that we could still win the round on that. Our second argument is about injecting fresh blood. We think that incumbents get complacent. They know that they have a high chance of getting reelected every time that they run so they try a lot less hard to impress the populace. They also don't have an incentive to try out any radical but helpful policies because they don't have a reason to risk not getting reelected, like higher social welfare spending or changing educational policies dramatically. Because even if this might be popular with some percentage of their electorate or even the majority of it, they're worried about the potential backlash from other groups that would prevent them from getting reelected. A lack of term limits actively contributes to gridlock and not getting anything done by keeping a body in governance that doesn't have a real incentive to get anything done since their jobs are never really on the line. Moreover it incentivizes groups just collect special interests because this is where the money comes from so they have the ability to rerun over and over again and just win easily based on the millions of dollars that they accumulate from non like individual groups but rather from special interests like pharma companies or gun lobbyists and similar groups. We also think that new candidates just tend to be better. They're more in touch with current issues, they have to work a lot harder to get elected, and they also haven't been exhausted by politics yet in the same way that older incumbents are. Like we think there's something to be said about the fact that people who have more recently come in from public sectors or like the private sector even or people who are just like more recently graduated are just individuals who are more in touch with the actual population and have spent less time in these spheres that tend to corrupt these older incumbents. We also just think that creating spaces for these people are really important. Like we think a lot of individuals just don't run for office in the first place because they are afraid of the fact that there are these never ending incumbents that are likely to win either way and we think is actually cuts out a lot of people who could be really beneficial in politics in the first place. Like people who are really motivated to help and like serve the population and never get the chance to. Proud to oppose.
We should not abolish intelligence tests. On our side of the house, we accept many of the things that tim told you. We completely agree that there is no one measure of intelligence and that intelligence means lots of different things in different circumstances, but we don't think that means that there's no value to intelligence tests. We're going to explain to you, first, why we need some sort of aptitude test, and second, why the alternatives are probably worse than the intelligence tests we have now. So, first, why do we need some type of aptitude test? Well, we have limited resources and funds to spend on the types of things that we use intelligence tests for, like identifying gifted children or choosing people for admission to a certain college or university. We tell you that given that we have these limited resources, we need some sort of at least quasi-objective way to assign them. We think that intelligence tests are better than the most obvious alternative, more on that in just a minute, namely individual judgments, but even if intelligence tests don't measure all intelligence, they clearly measure something. Tim makes a big deal out of the fact that quantitative intelligence isn't the only type of intelligence, but the fact remains that if you're choosing who to admit to a high school for gifted youth to learn engineering, then quantitative intelligence probably isn't the worst thing to measure. We're not advocating for intelligence tests to be used at every job interview or saying that they're perfect for every situation. On our side, all we have to do is prove to you that there are some cases when we should keep using intelligence tests, and I think that things like high school admissions are a clear circumstance when they are a good metric. Right? We can choose what type of intelligence we want to measure. If you were hiring someone to do HR, maybe you would give them a test focused more on the ability to recognize social cues and empathy, the kind of social intelligence tim mentioned. But if you're trying to bring people in, again, to a school for young people to learn math, who are very gifted, then we think that an intelligence test that measures your ability to see patterns and solve puzzles might be an effective tool. At the end of the day, tim needs to tell you why there's some reason that we can never use intelligence tests. And I don't think he'll be able to do so because it's clear that, first of all, some sort of test has to be used, and therefore some people are going to be filtered out because they don't do well on this type of test. You could compare the college admissions test in the united states, the SAT and the ACT, for instance. They're not intelligence tests per se, but they still are used for the same reason: to weed people out who don't do as well and who don't have as much scholastic aptitude, pardon me, whatever that means. But our second point is that the alternative is likely worse. First, we think it's likely that without some sort of quantitative test like an intelligence test, that people who are hiring or people who were doing admissions for a school will just rely on their own personal biases. They'll probably pick people who they think are well spoken or who just quote unquote seem intelligent. The problem with that is that then they're going to massively favor people from their own group. So if you have an admissions board that's made up of mostly like white anglo-saxon protestants in the northeastern US, then they're probably going to be biased against people with different accents, or people who don't come from a culture that values making eye contact in the same way, or people who come from countries where they don't shake hands. We think that at the end of the day, people are just going to rely on other worse metrics to make their decisions for hiring and admissions. We think that intelligence tests, while imperfect, still have some things going for them. They can be given anonymously to reduce bias. They can be intentionally created to focus on things that aren't racially or culturally determined, like arithmetic or pattern recognition abilities. So we think, at the end of the day, that intelligence tests are actually better than most of the alternatives we have available to us today. For all these reasons, we should not abolish them. Thank you.
Don't cancel the patriot act. First, I want to address sam's argument about the constitution. We just don't think this is true, right? Unreasonable search and seizure is about groups going into your physical home, etcetera, and collecting information without a warrant. We think that it's really different to have a situation in which you go in and have unreasonable search and seizure versus situation in which the government overhears or overlooks some of your communications, like they can't use that in a court of trial, right? They'd still have to obtain a warrant after that. And moreover, this is stuff that they look into digitally, it's not something that occurs within your home. But also, we think this only matters if it decreases your free speech, which isn't the way that this particular policy gets enforced. Then he talks about the fourteenth amendment, and we just don't think this is something that is accurate either, right? Like even though muslims may be disproportionately spied on, that's not a harm. Right? The harm that occurs is only spread across individuals who are actually criminals, because it catches their criminal activities. So there isn't someone that the patriot act actually disproportionately harms, there's just maybe someone that it is disproportionately used against. But that's not something that sam proves is wrong, so we don't think he can win the round on that, especially since the reason it gets disproportionately used on this group of individuals is because those individuals have been disproportionately linked to the situations of acts of terror. So we think that insofar as that provides a reasonable suspicion, we think this is justified. Two main arguments, first on preventing terrorism and acts of crime. Sam is worried about government obligation, but we think that the government has an obligation to protect the people and make sure they can feel safe going about their everyday life. It is really hard to catch crime and terrorism without access to people's more private correspondence. This is because no one announces that they're a they're a terrorist or that they're planning a bombing. This is the kind of stuff you only find out through their private calls, messages, shopping habits, etcetera. Like the government doesn't care about people who are going about their private lives or participating in low-level crimes. They just don't have time to go after your drug dealer when it's like just like marijuana or something. They don't care that you've been accessing like furry porn illegally on the internet. These aren't the things that the government cares about or has time to care about when they are spying on you through the patriot act. They're looking specifically to deal with the dangerous things, like organized crime, like high level terror attacks, and similar things. Our second argument is about making people feel safe. The knowledge that the patriot act exists makes people feel more secure in the state. This means that you have less backlash against individuals who are assumed to participate in terror unfairly, so individuals of muslim faith. It means that people feel less need to put more money into the military or militarize themselves, and you also get less people buying guns or advocating for state area militias when they feel like that's something they don't need as much, because the government has it handled. Moreover, things like the right to privacy only matter insofar as not having it makes people less comfortable taking the actions they usually would. This means that as long as they don't know it's being violated, it doesn't matter if the government continues spying. So all we really need is just less whistle blowers. But at the end of the day, the work of the patriot act itself is good. And as long as people don't realize the extent of the spying, we don't really think that there's a meaningful impact on privacy, because I still feel comfortable doing things that I'm usually embarrassed about if I thought that somebody was watching, because I just assume that nobody is watching. So, at the end of the day, we think at the point that the patriot act allows the government to maintain national security in a really important way, especially at a time where we're seeing massive increases in terrorist attacks, we think this is something that just outweighs the idea that maybe some people are unfairly discriminated against or some people feel like their privacy is being violated, just because there are infinitely more people who are living within the country who are going to be affected if something like a terrorist attack occurs. Proud to oppose.
Two things that international volunteering does: a, it perpetuates a cycle of future volunteering and b, it creates a cycle of future investments. Those will be our arguments in this debate. Before that, three points of rebuttal: one, yaar starts off his speech by saying if the comparative would be between volunteering abroad and not volunteering at all, obviously we'd prefer that people would volunteer abroad. Note he then doesn't explain to you why that is in fact the likely comparative. In fact, we think that they highly unlikely comparative. Why? We think international volunteering offers a unique selling point that local volunteering does not. A, it combines volunteer work with a special adventure with a special kind of trip that most people want to experience, so it's not a coincidence that most people do this volunteer work either between high school and college or right after college before they get a job. They find it to be a unique time in their lives where they can take the time off and experience something. We think if they weren't going to go volunteer in these places, they'd likely simply take a trip to these places and go on a large vacation. But b, because it is unique in time it means that they have to go now. It sets a deadline for them as opposed to all of the people sitting at home on their butts saying well I'll start volunteering next week or maybe I'll go on thanksgiving because since the door is constantly open they never feel the need to walk through. Secondly, we say even if it is true that it is mutually exclusive with local volunteering, we think that doesn't mean that it does more harm than good. We think the impact of the volunteers work is substantially more in third world nations. Yaar says look, a hungry family as a hungry family. That may be, but building a classroom for a community who for years has gone uneducated because they literally didn't have the building in which to teach people or the material work with which to teach students is always going to be substantially more impactful than volunteering at your local dog shelter. C, yaar says an emotional bond is made and then you leave and that's harmful to them. Note the assertion is and then you leave. The assertion on yaar's speech is that after one year you go home and you move on. That leads me right to my first point on future volunteering. Two points: one on yourself and b on others. As far as yourself goes, we think that same emotional connection that you get creates two things: one, an emotional connection to the specific people in community with whom you volunteered which means it's more likely that you'll continue volunteering them perhaps in your summers, perhaps just sending money there every out of every paycheck and two, an emotional connection to the act of volunteering and the feeling of elation that you get from helping others. We think that means that volunteering abroad makes it more likely that you'll volunteer when you get home. Two, we say it also impacts the way others see volunteer work because if volunteer work is seen as a chore than the scene is one that is difficult and unwanted but at the point at which people see some people donating their lives to this extent, going across borders, across countries in order to volunteer we think it makes those people feel more bad about not doing anything and therefore more likely to volunteer locally. So international volunteering doesn't hurt local volunteering. In fact, it helps it. How does it also help future investment in third world nations? We say the types of people who go volunteer, the types of people who soon are starting a business or career of their own, and crucially are often more well off to the extent that they can afford to take a year and work unpaid labor across the world. These people then get two connections to third world nations: a,they get an emotional connection to the specific communities and nations in which they work and b, they get an insight into the types of businesses that those places would need in order to perpetuate their economy. We think this type of face to face meeting means that these volunteers are more likely to incorporate these places in future business endeavors which helps the long term investment into these nations and therefore helps their economies grow on a much larger scale. For all of these reasons it is clear that international volunteering does far more good than harm.
We shouldn't abandon television. Our side of the house only defends providing television as an option. Even if it is true that it is not something that gets used super often anymore or might be a little obsolete, as long as there are people willing to pay for it, we think that the market will solve. If televisions get cycled out naturally over the next couple of years, we think that is a fair evolution of the market, but we don't think that there should be an artificial stance in which we abandon televisions all at once. Two main arguments: first, on the market for television. We don't think that television should be artificially abandoned because the market reflects what people want and prefer. So when tim talks about the potential increased interconnectedness, we think that's useless if that's not what people want. In the status quo, you can choose to use other platforms that don't involve television. The fact that there are people who still choose television shows that this is what they prefer, and we should just honor people's preferences since that's they know their own context, desires, and abilities much better than other people can assume to know those people's abilities, desires, or context. Television is easily understandable, nostalgic, and easy to access for people who are older as well as those who just aren't very technologically savvy. Tim talks about community, and we just don't understand why this has to come through the media that you consume. People find communities as they feel that they need them. So if I'm someone who's really lonely in reality, maybe I'll go sit on a couple of message boards, or forums, or youtube, and go form communities there, but the vast majority of individuals form communities through people who are in their everyday lives: coworkers, co-college students, any number of people who they associate with daily, who they prefer to associate with and aren't just artificially created by the media that they consume. Our second argument is about the ease of access and use. There are a lot of current replacements for television that are very technologically complex, things likes smart TVs, rokus, amazon fire sticks. These take things take hours to set up and oftentimes have some measure of complicatedness in their use as well. And it might be really easy for a younger generation that grew up around this technology, but when you are someone who is older maybe, or if you're someone who's just really bad with technology or didn't grow up with a lot of technology around them, then these things can actually just be really inconvenient. So if you're someone who prefers to spend their money on television instead of these other services, we think that's a completely valid perspective and honors your own abilities. Television provides an easy to use alternative that lets people have complete control over what they're streaming. They also tend to be expensive. These other platforms, if you're someone who only wants to access a very small amount of channels. Maybe you're someone who only watches the news or only uses television for sports. Then, at the point that that is true, we don't think that you should have to waste your time with other internet platforms, with their setup or with their cost, if you're really only going to be using a couple of channels and that can be something that is really cheaply bought, often in combination with your internet plan, for your regular TV. Tim talks about interaction and innovation. This'll happen either way, because the internet develops independently of people consuming television. Tim doesn't actually explain how the internet gets better with a decrease in television use. We also just think that plenty of people don't want interaction. They might be introverted or just not in the mood, and when that happens, it's fine to want to sit inside your house, on your couch, watching TV. But he also doesn't actually explain why these norms are different from the internet. Like, sure, maybe instead of being on the couch, now I'm in front of my computer desk, but I'm still being fairly antisocial, even if I'm communicating with people online. Like it's not as if I'm going outside or going for walks. So insofar as the ultimate impact that tim wants to talk about, these like antisocial norms are going to happen on both sides, you might as well let the person decide which platform it happens in front of. Proud to oppose.
Don't ban anonymous posts. I think the problem on danny's side of the house is that he misunderstands the way the majority of individuals use anonymous posts. Sure there are internet trolls and bad people who want to harass each other and racists and problematic individuals, but they are vastly outweighed by the majority of individuals who use these kinds of forms and these kinds of spaces not for hatred or for harassment but rather to do the things that the internet generally allows us to do. Make friends, have communities, ask embarrassing questions, and generally find out more about the world. So when you're adjudicating this round recognize that you're never going to be valuing all of those other people less than the people that that danny is talking about when he talks about these like harassers and these trolls because they just don't make up the majority of the individuals. Two main arguments, first on allowing safe spaces. There are plenty of people who turn to anonymous online communities for perfectly positive personal reasons. If you're gay and you need a safe community but don't want other people to know about it because you're not out yet, if you're a victim of abuse or controlling parents or partners, so online anonymous places are good for getting your questions, answers, or asking for help without your abusers finding out. If you're literally a teenager who just wants to make friends but doesn't want it following around in school or as they grow older and the majority of these anonymous posts are anonymous because the people behind them are just trying to keep their parts of their lives separate, but for not for any pernicious or problematic reason. And so we think that insofar as this can actually be a really important avenue for someone's security and like really dangerous tracking device on danny's side of the house we think that's really important. But also I want to talk about doxing because if nothing is anonymous than people's identifying information is infinitely easier to get a hold of and you will necessarily see significantly more doxing. When people review anonymous information about or personally identifying information about someone online and essentially say go get them and this often happens against people who can protect themselves less ie we often see that female video gamers get harassed by male gamers and like sometimes this transfers to reality and it can be actually very physically dangerous for these individuals and also feel like the people around them. So if you happen to have a child or a significant other who's involved in this they also get caught in the crossfire. And we think this is really dangerous for peoples' security. And danny says that you're gonna have all this harassment wit anonymous posts but we'd prefer harassment to be verbal instead of physical because real harassment is going to occur when you have not anonymous posting and that's actually going to impact people's physical lives. We're always going to defer to a world that even if you have more anonymous harassment keeps that digital rather than in reality. We also just think that his side of the house is always going to be worse for discourse because people who are afraid of being found out in reality so they're not going to post in the first place and it's not going to be the like bad people who are afraid to post because like bullies are going to be bullies either way. We think rather it's gonna be the people who are good for discourse like you know like edgy politicians and feminists and things like that who now are going to be worried about them being found out in reality and so they are no longer going to feel comfortable. Our second argument is about pushing groups underground. People with truly bad intentions are just going to go to the dark web which we actually think is worse because now you get no recourse against them at all and people also aren't going to have any idea of how large or how hateful these groups are. Like if danny is going to value discourse than he has to value people being able to participate in that discourse regardless of their background, their political beliefs, or whether or not their a bad person because it is only by putting these ideas into the marketplace of ideas that people can actually just prove them or say that they disagree or it simply understand that there are people who have these opinions out there who they would rather avoid. This can also be a security issue. Like if I'm a person of color or someone who's going to be discriminated against it's relatively important for me to know where and who these individuals are and if you make these posts if if these people get pushed out down underground, you never get to see that magnitude. Proud to oppose.
We should not ban smoking. Sam, in his speech, said that he interpreted this to mean that they would ban all tobacco. We think that this would be a mistake and that the government should allow adults to make their own decisions. I'm going to make two arguments, one about government overreach and the other about the effect that this would have in terms of its scope. Some rebuttal will be integrated into this speech. So, first: government overreach. We think that government should only intervene to limit personal freedom in a few instances. The first would be if there's unequal access to information. So, for instance, governments don't let children enter into contracts because they just don't have the experience and the knowledge to make informed decisions, but we don't think that's the case here with smoking because, today, everyone knows that smoking causes cancer and that it's addictive. We also think government can limit people's freedom in the event that they're hurting a third party, but I actually don't think that's the case here necessarily or that it's necessary to ban smoking for this reason. Sam correctly points out that secondhand smoke can be just as bad as smoking, but there are ways to get around this that are less restrictive than a ban. For instance, in los angeles, where I live, you can't smoke within twenty feet of a building so, you know, if you're at the bar and you want to have a smoke, you have to go way back in the alley. You can't smoke at the front of the bar where everyone else has to breathe in your smoke. So there's a less restrictive way to limit people's exposure to secondhand smoke than to totally ban smoking. And then, sam also points out a third-party harm in higher insurance premiums, and I'll talk more about that in just a minute, but it seems quite marginal and not really the government's concern how high your insurance premiums go. Yes, the government pays for insurance for some people, but because there are hundreds of millions of people involved in insurance in the states or tens of million in britain or in germany, we just don't think this is actually a very big concern. Therefore, we think that it would be an overreach of the government's authority to ban smoking. And, moreover, we don't think it would be the least restrictive thing the government could do. Why does it matter that we do the least restrictive thing with state power? Well, generally speaking, we think people deserve to live their lives as freely as possible, and sometimes we have to make sacrifices for the greater good. But we should prefer the to ask people to make the fewest possible sacrifices, and that means using the least restrictive means. And, therefore, we should allow smoking, with intelligent regulation. I think sam has to defend a complete ban, and that's just obviously a worse solution than limiting where you can smoke or limiting advertising and the like. Our second point is that banning smoking would actually not improve the status quo very much. So, just a brief bit of rebuttal in terms of what sam said about insurance costs. Insurance premiums are very high, but not just because of smoking. And premiums are going to keep going up as long as insurance is for profit. The problems with the US healthcare system cannot be attributed to marlboro or to other cigarettes. We think that that's just unrealistic and that even if you ban smoking, the US would still have very high healthcare costs. Why do we see that? Well, even for people who are getting treated for other diseases, costs are dramatically inflated compared to what they are in europe. So we just don't think that's the root of the problem, so nothing would change. And in terms of the environmental harms that sam addressed, we think that people will litter, no matter what, and that cigarette butts, while it's true that they cause fires in the pacific northwest or in southern california, are not the only cause of fires, and that perhaps there's a better way that we could allow people to dispose of cigarettes or a better type of cigarette we could design that would limit the threat. So, ultimately, because of this principle of using the least restrictive means, it's very clear that we should not ban cigarettes. Thank you.
The use of AI should not be abandoned. We think that every time a new technology has come around fear mongering has always fallowed. From the invention of the light bulb to the invention of the automobile to the invention of the internet, fear mongering has come with those innovations but so too has come economic prosperity and growth. Not only do we think that AI is so embedded in the framework of how our society works from from dictating how factories will work to dictating supply chains to dictating the economic changes in our in our markets, we think that in addition these changes are positive and should not be abandoned. The first argument that the government side makes takes on this fear mongering. They say the long term risks outweigh the benefits and that ultimately AI is going to lay off jobs in a way that is distinct from say the horse being laid off by the automobile, because AI that is general purpose can do every job and you can always make AI that will be better at doing future jobs. We actually don't disagree with this scenario. We actually think it's incredibly likely that this will occur. But we actually think that if you have a system like capitalism, people are forced to labor and toil and spend their lives doing , for the vast majority of people, jobs that they never wanted to do and jobs that are not fulfilling to them. We think that AI presents us an opportunity to shift to a post resource economy. A post capitalist economy. We think that just think about how this will change capitalism. Capitalism can literally not function with fifty percent unemployment. If no one can afford to buy the goods you're producing then there's no feasible way to have a capitalist economy. It just means that everyone will be broke at the end of the day. And we think of the people in power not going to particularly want this. Which means that we think that AI presents us the best opportunity in human history to shift the way that people are able to live their lives. That people can live lives of fulfillment, of leisure. They can dictate what outcomes they want to decide and will have the power to do the things they want to do for the first time in human history. We agree the transition is going to be rough. The next twenty to forty years between the point that we're out now with automation laying people off and the point that we predict will be at of a post resource economy, are going to be difficult. But if we get through it we think the long term benefits to humans are astronomical. The other argument they present is the kind of stereotypical super evil future of AI where the AI can go on and make bad decisions and people won't check it because they just believe in the AI and this just kind leads to the slippery slope of like: " oh maybe the AI is gonna kill us all. " Look, we think that already people make horrible decisions. We actually think that the leaders of the world really don't know what they're doing. It's not like we've seen in the last twenty years that people have been able to make great decisions when it comes to big problems like, I don't know, global warming or the the or the refugee crisis coming out of middle east, or the lack of clean water. Like, our leaders are already pretty bad at solving problems. We think that AI is likely to be no worse and probably better because it can consume data in a way and be unbiased in the way that humans can not. The second argument they make, we think it's kind of a throwaway argument, but it's that there's a bad use of funds and that you'd rather put money into food and clean water production. Look, if you actually look at the firms that are investing in AI and the firms that are putting money into this RND, the alternative is not food and clean water production, it's: " okay I guess we'll invest in better processing power. We'll invest in other forms of gathering data or we're gonna " they're not going to put money into food and water and clean water development. But we think that what putting it into AI can do is because general purpose AI can address the problems that the government side brings up, investing in AI might provide solutions to the problems that the government side brings up in a way that increased processing power or other types of technological advancements may not. For these reasons the use of AI should not be abandoned.
We should not legalize sex selection. In this speech, I'm going to explain why, first of all, this would lead to a an imbalance in society that would be very damaging and, secondly, about why this would lead to more bias against women. I'm also going to respond to some of sam's arguments as I move along. This rebuttal will be integrated into my speech. So, with that in mind, our first contention is that the sex imbalance that this would create would be bad for society. Why would this lead to a sex imbalance? We can see that, in many societies, people place a high premium on having sons relative to daughters. This is why some countries, like india, have had to ban sex selection, which presumably is what inspired this debate. In those countries, for cultural or sometimes pragmatic reasons, people want to have sons and see daughters as a liability. For instance, if you have to provide a dowry for a daughter and you receive a dowry for a son, there's a clear economic incentive behind wanting sons rather than daughters. So we think that, ultimately, if sex selection were legalized, in many countries, such as india, where this is the case, that there would be a huge imbalance in favor of boys as opposed to girls being born every year. Why is this a problem? We tell you that, first of all, societies where there is an excess of young men who don't have a lot of opportunity, such as many poor countries and many countries with a large gender imbalance, tend to suffer from more violence. Why is this the case? If young men are getting jobs and getting married and starting families, then they're probably happy with their system of government and the way things are going or, at least, complacent. If young men don't have jobs and don't have families, then they have much less to lose and are much more likely to join revolutionary movements. So if you look at the young men who joined the arab spring revolutions, for instance, most of them were unmarried men without a lot of opportunity. We can't guarantee that people will have jobs in the future but we can, by ensuring that there is an equal number of boys and girls being born every year, try to minimize the number of young men who are disengaged with the rest of the world because they can't marry and have a family, the way society tells them that they should. So you can see that rather than an issue of individual freedom, as sam portrays this, this is an issue of what's good for society at a macro level. Many individuals will simply have worse lives as a result of this sex selection, and it can lead to violence and imbalances that threaten the stability of the state, so I think it's clear that there is a reason for the government to ban this practice and that this is a just reason to limit the individual choice of parents. After all, we limit people's choice all the time when those choices affect third parties. And our second argument is about how this leads to even more bias against women. We think that one of the biggest checks on people's hatred for women in the status quo, especially men's hatred for women in the status quo, is simply the fact that fifty percent or slightly more of all people are women. We think that if women were to become a visible minority that this would only intensify the anti-female bias that we see among some men. And, in particular, if you have large groups of young men who cannot marry for the demographic reasons that I described earlier, I think many of those men will resent women and be much more likely to commit sexual assault or other violence against women as a result. So this can actually lead to a society that is more hostile towards women at the same time that fewer women are being born, which will then entrench the bias against having daughters and lead this problem to spiral out of control in a sort of feedback loop. So because this is bad for society and because it will entrench the sentiment against women in society, we would argue that you should not legalize sex selection. Thank you.
I stand in firm opposition to the motion we should adopt slow food. As my opponent says, slow food is a movement in which we prioritize slower cooking, slower eating and the collection of locally sourced goods. Ultimately, we just don't think this is accessible for a huge portion of the population. If what my opponent says is correct that fast food is less healthy, that fast food has problems, we don't think people are idiots. They choose it for a reason. Any system in which we abolish fast food in favor of slow food is one in which we ignore the autonomy of individuals, in which we truly deny individuals the capacity to actually be able to define what they want to eat which we think is a basic prerequisites to controlling their very lives. With that mind, my first argument is choice. Why do people choose fast food time and time again if slow food is an option? We don't think the reason is cultural. There's not really a huge push for fast food as the preferred meal of choice. A lot of the times people are already shamed for eating fast food which is completely unfair. We think a major reason that people eat fast food is they are poor, they want fast calories, and ultimately this is a way for them to get to work or school or the job far more easily. Even people who are wealthier, the reason they eat fast food isn't because they would because of some socialization away from slow food. The reason why is because they need to do it whether they're on the road or whether they simply have no other option. Any system where we adopt slow food is one where we deny individuals this choice. We think that slow food is already an option in a variety of places. Italian restaurants exist all over the united states even small towns have them and they often practice slow food. Honestly, anything that's not fast food is a slow food restaurant by my opponent's definition. As such, adopting slow food, abolishing fast food, will ultimately just decrease the total capacity for choice that people have which will a, cost them more money, which I'll talk about later, and b, ultimately diminish their capacity to live the best life possible by diminishing their capacity to make choices. My second argument is that of price. We think that for a lot of people slow food is just too expensive. Slow food takes longer, it takes more time and takes more man hours which ultimately costs more to actually be able to produce in a restaurant setting. The result then is one in which people in poverty simply cannot go out to eat at all. A lot of people consider fast food as eating out as a way in which they are actually having a more calm, happy meal. If we increase the price of all food that people can get, all ways that they can step out of their house and get a meal prepared for them, the result is one which people in poverty will be priced out of eating out completely which we think is wholly unfair. We also think things like food deserts will make it so the idealization of locally grown organic food makes it means that slow food is truly unattainable for a variety of communities. My third and final argument is that of health. Now it may seem unintuitive for why slow food is actually less healthy than fast food but we think it's pretty clear. A lot of the time slow food is made out of fattier cuts of meat, fattier forms of food. What we're seeing in the status quo is a world in which fast food is becoming far more healthy. Salads are becoming more popular. Veggie burgers, fish burgers and chicken burgers are replacing beef and cheese. The result then is one which fast food already has this push towards healthiness but we really don't see that as a possibility with slow food. Slow food constantly prioritizes using fattier cuts, more spices, more sodium and ultimately will become less healthier in the long term than fast food. For this reason, we should not adopt slow food.
Two arguments on the cultural rights of societies and on restrictions versus a ban. Before that, clearly what we stand for on this side of the house is restricting whaling to responsible whaling. James says to us: " you can't hunt responsibly, because look at japan they ignore the ban. " That's exactly the point. Some countries will ignore what you tell them to do. This is true if you restrict them, this is also true if you ban them. We see no reason why restrictions would work less well than a ban. In fact, we think it's more likely that restrictions will work than a ban. Why? A, because some countries only want some whales. If they listen to restrictions they can get everything they want while still being within the realm of what the international communities want for them. Note that they also have incentives to listen to international restrictions because it affects things like international trading, like relations with other countries etcetera. So if you give them enough they're likely to listen to it. Secondly, because for countries eh with, for whom it is a cultural aspect to do whaling for example, at the point at which you ban it from them they feel like you're attacking their culture and they attack back. At the point at which you limit it for them, then their culture can still be created and can still be practiced and they're likely to just adhere to the limitations. Few more points of rebuttal: one, james tells us it's a keystone species. Note that means that it also needs to be kept in check. Meaning if the population of whales gets out of hand then all of those things that the whale eats, that james goes way too much about, are likely to be over hunted as well and that's just as harmful. This means that maybe we've been doing too much whaling, maybe it needs to be limited even more in the near future, but in general we need to make sure that the whale population doesn't grow too large. Secondly he says they are a charismatic megafauna. Love that he knows that. Note that that point is on our side of the house. Why? Because it requires the species to be in some sort of danger. This means it happens more when that species is hunted to an extent and in danger to an extent, is able to get people involved. People like james arguing for for the banning of this hunting, than if they're already protected by laws that say you cannot hunt them. That means no involvement is necessary and that means fewer people get involved. Three, he says there are other side effects that no one can predict. This is just scaremongering. Either you can tell us what these side effects are or they're just as likely to happen if you allow the whale population to not be hunted, grow out of proportion etcetera etcetera, that can also lead to unexpected side effects. Lastly he says a bunch of assertions at the end of his speech the crucial thing to note is they all assume extinction of whales which doesn't happen under responsible hunting, which we already show you why it's as likely to work as a ban is. So first let's talk about a cultural right. Because we say the same way that jewish people get to to to shakht animals in a kosher way in order to respect their culture, the same way that you have the running of the bulls in spain, you are allowed to practice your culture even at the expense, to some extent, of animal rights because we recognize that the individuality of human cultures gets prioritized over rights of animals. Now, if they were to stand here and say no animals should ever be hunted, then they may have a morally consistent case. But at the point at which they say that I'm allowed to kill a cow merely because I find it tastes better than a chicken or than tofu, it seems unlikely that I'm not allowed to do it because it is culturally significant to my people. All of this comes to tell you there is good reason to allow some people to hunt whales. What does this mean? It means that restrictions ought be prioritized over an outright ban. We already tell you are restrictions are more likely to work properly because of a feeling of mutual acceptance between all the sides, as opposed to an aggressive ban, but we also think also think that it allows better maintenance of all of the rights involved when you on the one hand ensure that the animals get maintained that don't go extinct, but on the other hand also ensure that the human beings involved have an appreciation and the ability to practice their culture properly. For all those reasons we beg you to oppose the motion.
Don't subsidize distance education. James' model is stupid. Private universities will never have an incentive for distance education unless it is equally expensive to their normal classes. This kind of stuff only ever applies to independent programs that are usually affiliated with a state college or community college, because these are the groups that care more about accessibility than selectivity or or don't care about profit the way that private schools do. He's misunderstanding what the debate is about when he says, " look, we're pouring money into private institutions that are going to do this, " rather these things are never going to occur. Private institutions will never have those incentives, and if they do make distance education more accessible, it will only be to individuals who they accept into their programs. So either way, we just don't think that james is advocating for the right things. Two main arguments, first on why there are better places for the money. Government money is always a tradeoff. If you put money into one place, it automatically means there were other potential things that now could don't benefit off of them that could have. This places a really high burden on government's side. They have to show why distance education is the best place for this money when it could be subsidizing literally anything else. Ordinary education like public schools and universities are suffering a lot right now from budget cuts. This is more important because they educate a significantly larger portion of the population than distance education does. Also, because public education is generally better, it allows individuals to have face-to-face interactions with teachers, it has an obligation to make itself accessible and cheap, and any money set aside for education should definitely go to the public stuff first. James has this awful argument where he talks about how there's limited space at universities. Like, this is why there are tons of universities, right? Because we don't expect anyone to have infinite admissions, because that would be completely unreasonable. The reason there isn't space at any given school is because they want to maintain selectivity, so they purposefully keep their sizes low, but also because individuals don't stay completely around one area, right? Like, individuals are spread across the country. So, sure, maybe there are a lot of people in los angeles, and UCLA can only take some amount of those individuals, but there are also a million different colleges in los angeles and a million different colleges in the area surrounding. So the idea that this is ever an issue of accessing a particular university is nonsense, because there are other universities you can access. Our second argument is about why distance education in general is bad. James talks about how distance education is good for parents or people who are switching careers, but he's got it all turned around. We think that, actually, these are the individuals who need in-person education the most, because they're the people who need structure in their education the most. Distance education completely lacks structure, but it gets marketed to those who need it more because they're the people who are being told, " look, just use your free time. " But it's actually really hard to get home after doing an entire day's work and then motivate yourself to continue your education, right? This is why you need set class times and set penalties if you don't, not just a set of lectures that you can watch whenever and make infinite excuses for not watching. If you're someone who's poor, working a lot, has children, you need something that gets structured around your schedule, not something that tells you just do things in your free time, the way distance education does. We're better off pouring money into in-person education, like community college programs, so that they are accessible easily and physically for people regardless of where they live. The only reason people resort to distance education is usually because they don't have a comparably cheap alternative nearby. Distance education is pretty much always a last resort. If we can make regular in-person education more accessible, that will always be preferred. James has this weird argument about this one harvard professor. First, we think that a lot of professors who are very high quality will have published lectures online either way. But second, we think it's not about getting taught by the person who is best in the field, rather we think it is about getting taught by someone who is in front of you, genuinely cares about you, and has an incentive to answer your questions in a way that a harvard professor, who is doing this just in their free time or having automatic updates uploaded, isn't going to care. That only happens when you have in-person education. Proud to oppose.
We should not subsidize wikipedia. I'm going to explain to you why it would be bad for wikipedia if the united states or other governments were to give wikipedia substantial amounts of its funding. We have two arguments, one about independence and one about bias. So, first: independence. Tim tells you that this money would be given with no strings attached but, in fact, we tell you that there's no such thing. If a large government were to give wikipedia millions of dollars, they would have an expectation about its content. What does that look like? Well, if they like wikipedia right now, then they would probably discourage it from changing in the future. And recognize that wikipedia has changed a lot over the years in terms of its editorial standards. Wikipedia is professedly neutral, but the community is constantly redefining what that means in order to deal with new challenges that they face. But aside from that, we also think that it leads to expectations for content to match the wishes of the donors. So, if a big company like google, for instance, gave wikipedia money, which I think they've done anonymously in the past, but if they did that, you know, as an official sort of donation to wikipedia, there might be an expectation that wikipedia would devote more time to covering topics that are relevant to that business or that wikipedia would have favorable coverage of that business. Even though I don't think wikipedia would do that, we'll talk more about perceptions in just a minute, the fact remains that donors would have that expectation. So what this means is that wikipedia would now have to deal with the fact that donors would come in and give them support and then suddenly pull out, because they weren't happy with content or their wants weren't met. So as a result, the funding for wikipedia would actually be more unstable than their model right now, where lots of people around the world give them five dollars every now and then. Our second argument is about the perception of bias. There're a couple of things about wikipedia that are really incredible. One is that it's widely seen as authoritative by normal people. People trust wikipedia and think that what they read there is accurate, which is really rare in this sort of post-truth era that we live in today. If wikipedia were to be funded by, let's say, the european union, then I think in many places where the EU is seen unfavorably or where people don't trust the european union that, as a result, they would stop trusting wikipedia. So if like the german or the EU government gave wikipedia lots of money, readers in russia might think that wikipedia is no longer trustworthy because they would see it as anti-russian, even though the editors for the russian wikipedia are, one would assume, predominantly russian. We also think that this loss of credibility would be very damaging to the non-english wikipedias in particular. The english wikipedia is great. I learned a lot from it as a kid, I still learn a lot from it, and I'm told that it's very helpful for people who are learning english all over the globe, but I think that non-english wikipedias are actually more important. Realize that there are wikipedias in languages in sub-saharan africa that have never had an encyclopedia before. There are wikipedias in javanese and other languages that just haven't had a huge investment in education in the past for colonial reasons. I guess the dutch, in that case. So, as a result, wikipedia is uniquely important to those communities. Tens of millions of people speak javanese but they don't have their own encyclopedia britannica. If people who speak these languages feel like they can't trust wikipedia, that's going to be very damaging to their communities and their education relative to the effect it would have on the english-speaking world. So I encourage you to judge this round by thinking about the effect this would have on people who don't have access to any other encyclopedia if they weren't able to trust wikipedia because of its funding. For all these reasons, we should not subsidize wikipedia. Thank you.
In my speech today, I'm going to explain who and how homeopathic treatments help, and why it's important that we maintain their existence. Before that, three points of extraneous rebuttal: one, daniel talk to us about harms. A, he says, sometimes the treatments themselves are actively harmful. We're fine with banning those, if a treatment shows to have negative effects, no problem, ban those. B, he says, it creates an absence of other treatments, and that's harmful. Three responses: one, why does it create an absence? He never explains. We think this is supplementary medicine, it supplements western medicine, and goes together with it. B, often the reason turn, people turn homeopathy is because western medicine has nothing to offer them, other than waiting for death. Generally speaking, the reason, you would go to a homeopathic doctor, is because you have no other option. When that's the case, it's clearly not coming at the expense of any other treatment. Lastly, three, we're happy to say that a doctor should sign off on knowing that you're going to a homeopathic treatment, which means: a, you have to see a doctor, and b, the doctor can make sure that the medicines that he's giving you, versus the homeopathic doctor is giving you, aren't interacting negatively. That's fine. That is far from banning homeopathic treatments. Note, at the point at which, there is no active harm from homeopathic treatments, daniel's case falls, because he himself admits he needs active harm in order to ban this. Two, he says, they don't help beyond the placebo effect. True, we'll explain why a placebo effect is quite helpful. Three he says, it's cheaper, and so the decision is not a real decision to take these drugs. Two responses: one, economic factoring is part of almost every real decision, it does not mean that the decision is not a free decision, it means that's one that factors in economic reality. Two, here's another possible solve, subsidized medicines, like almost every western country does. If homeopathy is managing to undercut your medicines, probably the problem is that you're charging too much for your medicines. Let's talk about why, and how homeopathic treatments work. Daniel says, and I quote: " believing something works, does not mean it's actually going to work " when is that not the case? With the placebo effect. Specifically, homeopathic treatments have such a long history of belief that, their ability to produce a placebo effect is greater than that of almost any other medicine. Why is this important? Because the people who turn to homeopathic treatment are generally those who have been failed by modern medicine. Modern medicine is great, it's wonderful, it's amazing, but it doesn't have a cure for everything. People suffering from pancreatic cancer know that, their chances are survival are almost none. Those who have already undergone chemotherapy and tried surgery, know for a fact that they're going to die. At that point, two things are being robbed from them: one, their life itself, horrible. But two, any semblance of feeling of control towards the end of their lives, because not only do they know they're dying, they know there's nothing that they can do about it. Homeopathic treatments can, at least, bring that back. By truly opting into believing that this is going to help you, you a, regain that feeling of control, of thinking maybe there's something I can do for myself, maybe there's a way that I can advance my own future, and set my own fate. B, you give yourself a chance of feeling better. We're not going to go as far as saying that, placebo effects can cure cancer, probably not. But, it can make those last days substantially better in the way you feel. It can cure some of the feelings, the exhaustion, the pain that you get from cancer, merely through the belief that it's going to work. And if that's the case, and the comparative for that is sitting at home, knowing you're dying, and feeling in pain about it, we say homeopathy is absolutely a treatment plan that's worth pursuing. For these reasons, we oppose the motion.
I stand in firm opposition to the motion, we should fight nationalism. When we hear nationalism, we think of a lot of negative characteristics. It's largely used as an insult against individuals who have profound faith in their country, but it's largely unclear if it's actually a bad thing. Every time someone is called a patriot, every time someone exhibits patriotism, they're expressing nationalism. But in that same vein, we understand that patriotism can be a good thing, that it can be used for good and that it can generally change people's opinions such that they love their fellow man more and work harder for their community. With that in mind, I have two arguments, but first some brief rebuttal. My opponent says that nationalism is the opposite of democracy and freedom. He says that as we express nationalism, individuals lose the right to vote, foreign people don't have the ability to access the country. Two big responses: first, we think that nationalism can come in a form where you do accept foreign individuals. We think that the united states, for instance, is a country founded by immigrants. You can be a nationalist for the united states and, at the same time, accept that immigrants are an important part of our national fabric. As such, we don't think that nationalism is inherently against individuals who come to your country and want to actually work for the betterment of all people. It may be against other countries, but it's not against other countries to the point where you just want them to do poorly. It's not like you pray that china, india, mexico, all just do poorly. You only pray that other countries do poorly when it would cost your country something, which we think that many individuals already do. Second, though, we think that it's not against democracy, and it's not against freedom if this nationalism comes about naturally. That is to say, if individuals adopt this nationalism without any further outside pressure, it's not actually bad for democracy. The only way that it would be bad for democracy is if we artificially fight nationalism and artificially try to change people's opinions, which is what my opponent tries to do. Their second argument is that it's fundamentally immoral, that it makes people really bad, but we think that it actually gets worse when you try to fight nationalism. This leads to my first argument: backlash. When you take an active step against nationalism, a few things happen. First, people think the government or society is going against their beliefs and trying to shut them down or censor them. This pushes them further to the fringe. Furthermore, we think that as you fight nationalism, you may transfer some of the moderates out of that group, but you still have the extremists. This largely largely creates a political and social block that is more extreme, more violent, and more hatred-filled. The result then is that individuals who are immigrants, individuals who are different, start to feel more pressure from these extremist groups. You see extremist politicians come to power and they pass bad policy. My second argument is that nationalism can actually be good. We think when individuals feel nationalism and as a result start to fight for their communities, start to change the world in a better way, we think that's good nationalism. Every time you hear patriotism, that's someone saying that nationalism is a good thing. When people fight for their country, whether that's helping to do community service or that's paying more taxes than others individuals do. We think that, ultimately, nationalism can be a force for good to improve your community and improve the lives of your fellow human beings. This fundamentally cuts against everything my opponent says. If nationalism can improve people's quality of life, if people can feel proud in their country and want to spread that to the world, we think that the world as a whole becomes a better place. For this reason, we should not fight nationalism.
Just like many institutions of higher education even the most luxurious ones require their students to participate in physical activities or to do sports of some kind. It seems perfectly reasonable to us that we're going to have academic requirements from athletes. We think that both training your mind and training your body are of the highest importance and under no circumstance do we agree with side government's logic that assumes that these two things are necessarily mutually exclusive or that people have to be completely devoted to their academic studies or to their sports alone. We would even dare say that it's unwise and unhealthy to be invested all in in just one of these things without the other and it's the combination of them of the two that like even if it means that you can devote less of your time to just sports or to just studying, it makes you a richer person as opposed to just one dimensional. So the government start by saying that athletic scholarships are a shameful exploitation of the athletes. This claim is absurd right on its face because nobody's forcing these sportsmen to go there. They choose to. So unless the government thinks that all of these athletes are stupid enough to continue entering willfully this trap in which they're being exploited and don't gain anything in return, then they must agree that these people probably think that they are getting something in return. So what they say is basically that that their diploma or the degree that they're going to earn by the end of their college time isn't going to really be useful to them. Here are a few answers to this. One, there are a million students that graduate college and then don't use the actual knowledge that they've obtained or the diploma that they've got and that's after unlike these athletes they were also forced to pay ridiculous amount of money for it, but as long as they entered voluntarily, we don't think that you can seriously call this exploitation. Two, we merely don't accept this claim. We think that many do make good use of their degree or of the tools that they've acquired in a later stage in life. We mustn't forget that a lot of the people on scholarships don't make it to become professional athletes and will need to pursue other career directions and even the one that that do make it and become professional athletes you know usually their sports careers end at a relatively young age and they will still have to find employment in other fields. So without the diploma that they've received because of the scholarship, it's going to be a lot harder for them. This is true even if government government are right in assuming that these people aren't going to excel in their studies because at least they had the title and that in and of itself is a very important signal to employers today in the job market. Third answer, we also think that studying is really not the only thing that people stand to gain from the experience of higher education. This is a social experience that a lot of people consider to be one of the most beautiful periods in their lives. You get to mix and mingle with all sorts of people from all types of different fields of interest in different different backgrounds. You often are a part of a fraternity or a sorority that's especially true to jocks, by the way, in which you are going to form friendships that will accompany you later in life. Countless people found their significant others in college. These are all meaningful stuff and we can we can't like for certain, just say with such ease that you graduate without having anything like without gaining anything. We think that's ridiculous. Fourth answer and final answer, we say that since we are talking about minority populations dissident franchise populations we think that without college there is a high risk that many of them are going to lead very hard lives, street lives. College gives them a purpose. It gives them a framework. It makes you a part of a team. It teaches you discipline. Okay so now all that's left is for us to deal with the counter factual that side government is offering of junior leagues. Basically we say that based on all of the things that we've already said this counter-factual has a lot like far fewer advantages. It tracks people into focusing on sports only and by so, it shallows them down to just one dimension and doesn't provide them with the tools in case they don't become, you know, as rich as lebron james and will actually need to find another job which you know is kind of likely. It prevents them the social like the meaningful social experience of college and the interaction with people outside of the sports world. Athletic scholarships are a win win situation. They're a marvelous thing. Please oppose the motion.
Casinos should not be banned. In this round, we're going to do two things. We're going to, first, give a positive and principled explanation for why we think casinos shouldn't be banned by the government, why this would be an unjust ban, and then we're going to respond to the arguments that the government side makes. So, first, why do we think that this would be an unjust ban? We think that the very purpose of the state is not to dictate how people ought and ought not spend their money or dictate what people do in their own private lives, but rather to create an apparatus in which people have the freedom to make decisions based on their basic rights: their right to property, their right to liberty, these types of things. We think that casinos, while they may cause detrimental behavior in some cases, while they may have the why they may promote things like gambling addiction for certain people, at the end of the day, the government's job is not to say that people cannot spend their money gambling if they would like to do so. So long as they're not creating some sort of direct third-party harm, people have the right to make those decisions with their money. And we think that people often the vast majority of people, one: are not addicted to gambling, so when we're talking about the general public, we're not talking about people that have a serious problem with it ; and two: we think that people have a a general knowledge that gambling is gambling, and going to casinos is unlikely to be something that's going to be a large benefit to yourself. Like people don't go to casinos, for the most part, to make money. We think that this sort of idea that the government side presents, saying that it targets vulnerable people and and casinos are like based on this promise of riches, I think that this is, one, non-unique. Like most products oversell themselves in the market, and we allow those types of hyperbolic things legally, because people are able to recognize that that hyperbole is not true. But also, we think that just the general knowledge is such that people know they're probably not going to make a lot of money on casinos. So given that there's no direct third-party harm from this gambling in casinos, we think the government is not obliged or even even granted the power legitimately to ban casinos. But let's talk a little more directly about the government side's arguments. The first argument is, essentially, gambling is like an addiction for many people, that studies show that those that are gambling addicts have similar chemical reactions or chemical processes going on to those that are drug addicts and because we regulate drugs, we should also regulate gambling and ban it. So, first, this is just a massive is-ought fallacy. The government doesn't explain why it's a good thing that we currently treat drugs the way we do, and we think, in fact, the way that we have outright prohibited drug use has been a major problem in our society and has caused many harms in and of itself. But additionally, we think that, unlike certain drugs like heroin, where you are incredibly likely to get addicted and therefore the government may have a certain interest in making sure that you don't do things like heroin, we think that the government doesn't have that same interest in banning casinos, because most people that go to a casino don't get addicted to gambling. It's a much lower rate of harm and, therefore, the government isn't really isn't justified in acting for some sort of nebulous purpose of the benefit of the of the people, the benefit of the polity. The government also then makes the argument that gambling casinos, they're just a bad use of resources. Again, we don't think it's the job of the government to ban you from spending money in the way that that you see fit. The final argument that the government side makes is that casinos are bad, for a number of reasons, for the local area, because it causes economic depression, pushes out other businesses, and promotes a lack of other criminal activity. Look, first, I think that empirically is not true that these areas have higher rates of criminality. But if you buy what the government side is saying, we think it's fine to allow communities, on their own, to block casinos, but we think that a blanket ban on casinos, in all instances, is generally a bad policy, and getting communal approval for one is a good way of checking against all of the harms that the government presents. For these reasons, casinos should not be banned.
So side governments case in this debate basically says the following thing, there are no clear advantages to the cloning of specifically human beings that we cannot achieve by cloning human organs or cloning animals or bringing babies to the world. But there are a few potential ethical problems that might arise with regard to how society treats the cloned people. We are going to win this case by first pointing to some great advantages in specifically human cloning, and secondly by showing you why all of the concerns that were brought up by side government are technical and solvable and not inherent. But before that we think that we need to discuss the mental state or the mental situation of these clones, because this can help bring a little bit order to this discussion and make it a little less blurry. I think that we need to ask whether my clone also includes all of my personal traits and my memories or is it like a totally new born baby that comes to the world tabula rasa. The other side chose not to address this question but I think that it is implied from their logic that we are talking about the former. That a clone like we're talking about clones that are that are created as exact replicas of the person there they were cloned from. And this includes also mental state and whatever stems from this. Because you know they talk to us about the clones being human agents and about property claims to the like of the original person. So from now on we are simply going to assume that this is the situation we're going to go with that. Okay so side government don't see any advantages to cloning. Here are some meaningful ones: a, if god forbid, I lost my kid or my partner in a car accident or something, cloning might help me bring him back to life. That's right, I'm talking about overcoming death. If this is not a meaningful benefit, I truly don't know what is. B, it is possible to clone great thinkers. Now think about how much could be achieved if there were two or three more einstein's that could join forces in research of the universe. Now there's a lot more to say, but I think that we'll settle for these two advantages for now. And note that these are advantages that could in no way be achieved by simply cloning sheep and are unique to human cloning. Oh but what about the ethical problems that tim talks about? Well let's see. First he talks to us about there being property rights issues to the clone. This is a very weird point. This will be a person, not a property. No one has property rights to it. Like, problem solved. Next he talks about cloned organ reaping farms or something. Now never mind the fact that a minute before that, he tells us himself that we are already developing technologies for cloning organs that are going to solve this shortage problem therefore there's no sense in such farms. But hey here's an idea, let's outlaw such farms if they do if they will exist. Human cloning will probably be easy enough to supervise. It's expensive as team says, it's not something that you could simply do with great ease and speed at some back alley, so it will be pretty easy for us to make sure that this doesn't happen. Problem solved. And then tim tells us that society is going to treat these clones with great cruelty. Now perhaps that's true, society is in fact not very patient towards whoever is considered different. But it's it's no different from problems of prejudice and discrimination that minority populations have to deal with every day. This is simply a matter that takes some time and an adjustment period and and eventually this will be solved as well. It might take a few generations for sure, but that by itself is not a good enough reason to curtail the scientific progress and to prevent all of the great advantages of human cloning. Please oppose the motion.
We believe that banning cosmetic surgeries harm both the principle of autonomy over one's body and people's identities. But first of all we think that we should distinguish cases of true deformities or, for instance, procedures that are meant to restore one's previous looks after he suffered an injury that resulted in some deformities. Side government doesn't say anything to that effect. All they talk about is botox and like breast enhancement surgeries. Obviously we think that that is a huge impact in the debate and a huge harm that they do not address at all. Moving on. They talk about how cosmetic surgery enhances the model of beauty in all of its harms to society. We wonder therefore are they also in favor of banning make up, high heels? What about liposuction surgeries? What about going to the dentist to make your teeth whiter? What about tattoos? We say that all of these examples are also like following from the logic of the analysis of side government. Moreover they talk about the financial costs and how not everyone can afford it and those who do who are able to afford it need to spend a fortune on it. Obviously this is true to so many things that it would be impossible to even count. People spend a fortune on designer clothes, on fancy cars, in ways that don't make any sense, other like but for the fact that this is some sort some sort of like a status that gives them like social capital. Now that too is is based on social norms that aren't necessarily rational but we do not think that the government can even imagine saying that because this is expensive and some people can't afford this this is a good enough reason in order to ban access to all of these things all together. Onto the constructive: we say that even if there is truth to the ideal of the government, they have to explain, they have the burden to explain why they think that it's legitimate to force a lot of people to suffer through a miserable life in which they feel very much uncomfortable in their own skins in order to serve this ideal. Say that I was born with the disfigurement of some sort, that makes me ashamed or insecure, now even if in a perfect world this shouldn't have bothered me. The fact is that we don't live in a perfect world and the government doesn't really give us any type of convincing mechanism to believe that in a world without cosmetic surgeries this thing is going to change drastically and that people would stop judging each other according like based on how they look. So why should I pay the price for that? It's not my fault. We say that a person's look is a and like a very basic element in his identity. It's out in the open, it's the first thing that people notice about you. Whether we like it or not, our appearance deeply affects our life. The options that we're going to have, the type of connections that we're going to make with other people, now it can be argued that this has become too extreme because of the model of beauty but that's a reality that is unlikely going to change because people are just programmed by nature to be attracted to or to be like not attracted to people based on their appearance. For all of these reasons we say that most people are concerned about how they look and they want to look as good as they can. So we say that when a person is unhappy with a certain feature of his appearance this can massively harm his his like feeling of self worth and self confidence. You feel trapped in your own body and there's no escape. This is a feeling of shame that escorts you everywhere you go even when you are alone. Every mirror becomes your enemy. In fact we say that it's kind of like people that that feel that they were born to the wrong sex and the government wants to force them to continue on living this way even though a solution is available. Is the solution perfect? Are there no problems with it? Obviously no. It's a debate. But deciding for these people that are interested in it that the cost is too high for them is just incredibly patronizing and not something that side government can simply decide. For all these reasons we beg you to oppose.
Don't encourage self employment. Tim spends a while ragging on how automation is taking over jobs so self employment should be the response but doesn't explain the logic between the two being connected and we just think these two things aren't related at all. Automation is equally likely to take over jobs that are self employed versus those that aren't because the services that are provided by those that are self employed are often really similar services to the kinds that are provided by large corporations. Whether it's the production of a good or the offering of something like therapy or massage or like any number of other things. Like the sectors that are going to get swept up by automation don't care if you're self employed or not, they're going to replace both. Moreover as automation takes over some sectors other sectors open up. So sure you're not going to have truck drivers as often but now you have more customer service reps, more engineering, all of these other things. Unless what niche tim is filling with self employment, it's really unclear what niche tim is filling with self employment since self employed individuals, as I told you, provide similar services to that of corporate corporate ones. So automation will take over both. We think a lot of people come up with the idea of self employment on their own if that is something that is right for them. This means that they're these are people who are already having an idea and recognizing that they are the best person to fulfill it. We think that outside of those people it's bad to encourage individuals before they have had those ideas independently, because it makes direction-less self employment much more likely. IE people will decide that they're going to be self employed but won't have a good idea of how, ultimately leading them to failure. We have two main arguments, first on why it's risky. The majority of of individuals will not succeed being self employed. Being self employed requires a lot of self control, budgeting, scheduling, strong innovative and creative skills. Encouraging it is thus a bad idea because you're essentially setting people up to fail because majority of people don't have these characteristics or at least not strongly enough to manage themselves. All of tim's impacts about how there will be more innovation only function when people being self employed are being productive. We think those people are likely to be self employed either way since there personally driven and know they have found a niche. Sure, you might have your like it might be hard to work for someone else, like there might be negatives to that but we think that when you're self employed, because you're going to depend on the consumer base rather than on your boss this is actually really bad in a lot of ways as well. Because when you work for someone else you get the same paycheck regardless of how business is going for the majority of jobs whereas when you're self employed if business is going poorly you're dumb out of luck. We have to recognize that tim is massively sugar coating how self employment plays out and what the risks actually look like. Because he pretends that you're automatically going to have this great life where you get to do all of these things and control everything. But that requires your idea to be successful, which a really small percentage of groups actually are. Our second argument is that it is lower reward. First self employment doesn't usually pay well. Like tim talks a while about how you're going to choose your income but he's forgetting that a lot of the time startups don't actually make money for the first couple of years that they're afloat so turning a profit actually takes a massive amount of up front investment and also a massive amount of self control, because you have to be willing to bite the costs of the start up. Like you're the one who's going to be skipping meals and you're the one who's going to not be able to afford things for a while. You're also going to paying all the management costs. If anything goes wrong that's also on you. So the idea that you're just going to be stinkin rich because you get to pay your own salary forgets that you also have to be responsible for the entire company. Moreover, you don't get any of the benefits that you get from holding a job. You don't have over time you don't get insurance, there isn't a pension plan and this places a massive burden on you as the person who is self employed since you have to provide and budget all of these things for yourself. We think a lot of people simply aren't prepared or in a place where they're likely to do these management things effectively. Proud to oppose.
We actually agree with the previous speaker that eighteen-year-olds are perfectly able to drink responsibly, but he himself does a fantastic job of explaining how the legal age limit is not really the de facto age in which you start drinking. We are well aware that eighteen and nineteen and twenty-year-olds drink alcohol left and right, and we're fine with that. But the problem in lowering the drinking age, the legal drinking age, to eighteen or to sixteen is that it subsequently will lead to the lowering of the de facto age that kids start drinking to like fourteen or fifteen, and that's already something that side government would also agree that is un like preferable. So here's what we say, basically: the legal definition of who is a minor and who is an adult will forever be random. Whether we set it at twenty one or eighteen or sixteen, it is clear and obvious that it won't really apply equally to everyone. Of course, there are sixteen-year-olds that are very mature and calculated and trustworthy, and there are twenty-two and twenty-three-year-olds that are very immature and reckless. Therefore, it doesn't matter where we draw the line, it is going to be, at the same time, overinclusive and underinclusive, but we still have to draw the line somewhere. So, we're willing to accept the position of side government that most eighteen-year-olds are responsible and mature enough in order for us to be fine with having them drink, but we but we think that they will also concede that most fourteen-year-olds are absolutely not responsible enough. What we also must take into consideration, when we draw the line, are the effects that daniel explains so so like so nicely of how, you know, the taboo when something is forbidden makes me want it more and so on. So, this means we need to acknowledge the fact that no matter where we draw the line, this means that like in the vicinity of that limit, people will not abide by it. For this reason, we had a very good reason to take this extra buffer zone and to set the legal drinking age to twenty-one. This comes out of the understanding that most eighteen and nineteen-year-olds will still be drinking and that's fine, but far less fourteen-year-olds will be will be drinking because it will seem so much remote to them. Note that all of the harms that the previous speaker lists in regard to like reckless responses like irresponsible drinking that results from not being of the legal age will simply apply tomorrow to fourteen-year-olds, and that's much worse. So, we see the same type of logic in other places in the law, by the way. For example, when setting speed limits to like roads and highways, it's perfectly obvious to the government that most people will exceed the like the limit and the speed that that's allowed in a in like a few percent. But in most cases, like the police will even turn a blind eye to mild violations. Yet, these limitations are set in a manner that is relatively conservative, like just in order to make sure that whoever violates them still doesn't drive too fast. We call this the anchoring effect. This the number that we set is being used as a sort of a metaphorical anchor that people don't stray too far from. So, we say that it's it's perfectly like reasonable what the other side are saying, that the current drinking age is a bit unfair to eighteen-year-olds but as they tell us themselves, like eighteen-year-olds don't really suffer too much out of this. They drink anyway. So if we lower the drinking age, we say that the damages are going to be much more significant. So, oppose the motion.
Okay, so what side government are saying is that this program is going to increase the number of heroin users or addicts and that using heroin is bad enough by itself, so that preventing like increased usage outweighs the benefit of preventing diseases like HIV or STD's. We in opposition oppose both these claims. This is why, in this speech, I will first show I will first answer directly the previous speaker's arguments and show that the number of people that are going to use heroin as a result of the needle exchange program is very small to practically nonexistent, and then I will argue that even if this is not the case and we will have more usage, this is still worth it because the benefits outweigh the bad sides. So we heard from tim three explanations as to why there's going to be increased usage of heroin. First, he tells us that it's that it's just going to be easier to obtain needles. People who otherwise would have to quit because of the circumstances would have to can go on using. This is nonsense. There is no drug addict that the that the sole reason that he isn't using drugs is because he couldn't find a needle. If it is a normative person or an occasional user, then he would have no problem obtaining a needle in a pharmacy. If it's a drug addict, a real junkie, then he hangs around all day in areas filled with needles. It's not a problem for him to find one, and he doesn't care that if the needle is used or not or if it's clean. That's exactly the problem that this program is trying to deal with. Accessibility is not really an issue. We can cross that that one off. Secondly, we hear that this increases or, sorry, decreases the risk for contracting HIV and therefore, it's less deterring. Again, this argument isn't relevant for constant users that are already physically addicted and have to get the next fix, no matter what. These are not people who are able to perform the rational judgment that's required for deterrence to be a factor. This argument is only relevant for people who are not constant users that maybe are contemplating whether to use it or not for the first or second or third time, but these people are usually very much aware that they need to be careful and use fresh needles. They are not the one to recycle used needles, and therefore there is no change in the level of deterrence that they experience. It doesn't get less risky. This is only true to the people who are wh are recycling needles, and they are way past deterrence at this point. Lastly, we hear that we are sending a signa. L from the government that heroin is cool. Obviously, that's not true. That's just like saying that by offering, you know, rehab programs, then we are the we are endorsing usage. Nobody's going to see this and tell himself, " , now I'm going to inject some heroin because the government is all for it. " That's silly. But you know what? Perhaps sending these people a message, a more understanding message, is not such a bad idea. This actually leads me to my next point. Why is it okay even if it leads to more users? So, we say that part of the biggest problem of drug addicts is precisely the way in which they are being shunned by society and perceived as criminals or as dangerous people rather than just seeing them as people who are facing a a problem, a disability, and need help. Think of how unequally we treat drug addicts and people with cigarette or even alcohol addictions. We think that this treatment from the society is exactly what causes a heroin user's life to be particularly miserable, and this is also what brings most people from being part-time users to full blown junkies, because they have to hide because of the shame. They need to do it in secret. They are scared of seeking out help. This is how you reach a situation that you are so dependent on the narcotic that you are recycling needles and you are catching diseases. Now, we haven't really heard from tim why he thinks that dying of aids is less terrible than just injecting. He just asserted it. We think exactly the opposite. Listen, this program enables us to save lives and inspire hope in people who have already lost all glimmer of hope. Please oppose the motion.
Don't ban organic foods. Look I think this assertion that james has that like organic foods are just as bad for you as nonorganic because they just replace old chemicals with new chemicals is literal nonsense, right? Like the standards for becoming organic that james talks about so often involve not having any chemicals of certain classes which means that if they are replacing it with something it is automatically less toxic than whatever was used before. I also really dislike james' assertion that because the chemicals that we use on nonorganic food are okayed by the FDA and other groups for human use, this makes it a situation in which those chemicals are safe, right? Recognize that chemicals like chlorpyrifos, a incredibly popular widely used pesticide, is something that is also incredibly dangerous confirmed by numerous studies to be neurodevelopmentally toxic to children is still on the market because we recognize that these corporations often outweigh the benefits of general society when it comes to the governments that make these kinds of decisions and the agencies that make those decisions. So it is not the case that we are automatically safe and don't need the organic label and we think that actually it denotes a really important difference for a lot of people who want to stay away from those chemicals. With that we have two main arguments, first on freedom of choice. Look we think that people should be able to self determine and be happy. Like james says that consumers are being taken advantage of and we think this is literal nonsense, right? Anybody can google what the parameters for organic are, what organic means, and then make the decision of whether it is worth the extra money for themselves. This just isn't a meaningful asymmetry of information because it can be easily corrected unlike many others. Then he talks about how this drives up food costs only for the price of organic food which also costs more to produce so it makes sense. If anything we think it drives the price of other food down since nonorganic food now has to compete with organic food for a similar consumer base. So this means that people who can't afford organic food are getting more options of nonorganic food on our side of the house. James' argument about shelf space is literal nonsense. Grocery stores respond to the economic context of the regions they are in, so if they're in a really rich neighborhood where people can afford organic food they'll stock more of that and if they're not they won't because grocery stores also need to remain profitable. And this phenomenon won't change even if james gets rid of the term organic because those other labels he says will still be allowed to exist would just replace it. Our second argument is about the potential for payoff. Sure there's not much research but we don't actually know to what extent nonorganic food is bad for you, and we don't think this makes it misleading the way that james says right? Like there are some guaranteed benefits from organic food. Like you know if you're going to be ingesting less chemicals, you know that you're usually supporting a more ethical farm like as we told you just because other chemicals have been approved doesn't mean they are safe. Like it is completely possible that people who prefer organic food had it right all along and that it's actually significantly better for you. And if that's true, this pays off for them and that means they should be able to weight that potential themselves. James makes an argument about how this hurts small farms. This is literally inaccurate right? He's just lying to you throughout his speech. Like this is exactly the group that benefits here because small farms often automatically use less mass production techniques so it's infinitely easier for them to fit under the classification of organic. Like rich yuppies are always going to love small farms, it's just not an issue in this round. But we think what is an issue is that for people who have food sensitivities or chemical sensitivities these kinds of labels are really easy ways to indicate that something is safe for them to consume and indicates more humane treatment of animals, especially for beef products where being organic means you have to be fed properly and not be overly medicated. And if these are values that matter to you, then that labeling is really important. Proud to oppose.
Assisted suicide should not be a criminal offense. On our side, contrary to what sam has told you, we're going to explain why this is actually something that can be effectively regulated and, also, why it's important to respect individual preferences. So, first, sam tells you that even people who are terminally ill could never opt in to this because it would limit their own rights and freedom, but I think that this is an absurd argument. If you're someone who has stage four cancer and your life consist exclusively of suffering in a hospital, what rights are being taken away if you choose to opt in to assisted suicide? Right? We're not talking about setting up suicide booths, like in futurama, so anybody who's down on their luck can just walk in and push a button. We're talking about having a physician have an informed conversation with someone who is already terminally ill and in, frankly, a horrible circumstance about what they want the last few weeks of their life to look like. The comparative is not someone who would go on to vote and use the right to free speech and all of these other things versus someone who now can't. The comparative is between someone who chooses to die while they still have some dignity and mental faculties versus someone who chooses to lie in agony for the last few weeks of their life. So I just think that the comparison that sam gives you has no basis in reality and that it is absolutely possible to regulate this effectively. We can require consultation with multiple doctors. We can require that the patient's family be informed. We can require that you meet with someone from social services or some other similar organization in order to prevent people from being taken advantage of in this way. So I think that, ultimately, it's possible to regulate this effectively, as they already do in states like washington and countries like the netherlands, and that people aren't meaningfully losing out on anything except for a few weeks of pain and suffering when they opt in, and therefore that there's no reason to ban this simply based on someone's rights. That seems a little bit absurd. But even if you did buy out on the fact that people were losing their rights, why should this then be a criminal offense? If you buy stocks from someone at an unfairly low price, you're limiting their future right to self-actualize, but that's not a criminal offense. Clearly, you need to be doing actual harm, and it's not clear to me that doing something with someone's consent in this way is an actual harm. So I think we need to hear more about that from sam. But secondly, we would tell you that individuals know their own preference better than the government does. What does this mean and why is it important? Governments might have lots of information about people, on aggregate. So the government of massachusetts might know that men who are twenty three years old and who live in boston are more likely to die from lung cancer, so maybe they'll pass some laws to make it harder for me to buy cigarettes. Not that I smoke, but hypothetically. But if I know my own preferences and I know that it's worthwhile to me to smoke because of the benefit and the joy that I derive from it, even after doing research, I don't think that the government has actually got more information than I do. They can have all the information on aggregate but no information about my personal preferences. So I think that we need to defer to individuals to make their own decisions about what is right and wrong for them, in particular for something that's as serious as how they want to spend the last few weeks of their life. At the end of the day, we think that people have an equal understanding of death. No one has ever died before and been able to inform us about it, or purports are controversial, let's say, so I don't think that experts in a government planning office have more knowledge about whether people can opt in to death than anyone else. So we can probably safely defer to individuals to make their own decision based on their beliefs about death and based on their beliefs about their own quality of life. For all of these reasons, assisted suicide should not be a criminal offense. Thank you.
I'm not going to challenge the notion that tibet deserves independence. I'm no expert on the region, but it seems like their claim is strong enough. But by the way, tibet is not unique in this sense. According to side government's logic, we must also mention that taiwan deserves independence, like a full independence from china, but it's hardly only china. The catalons deserve independence from spain, the basques and the corsicans deserve independence from france, the bavarians from germany, the lombardians and sicilians from italy. Hell, almost in any country we can find a secessionist movement with a valid claim, because this is the nature of a nation state. These are almost inherently over-inclusive, they almost always impose an artificial union on certain minority groups that are distinct from the majority population. Even in the united states there are talks of separatism on the count of certain states in the south. So, according to side government's logic, we need to support all of these efforts with economic sanctions and embargoes, and this will simply leave us without any trading partners. It's the first burden on side government in this debate to justify and explain why they are cherry picking the tibetan struggle specifically over other justified efforts and struggles, why do they wish to raise its flags, what's so special about tibet that separates it from all the other geographic areas that I've mentioned, that also strive for independence. The next point that I want to make is that this fight, by means of like economic tools, wouldn't do any good. In fact, it will create the opposite. It will be bad for tibet, it will be bad for us in the west. So the previous speaker seems seems convinced that if we only apply a little bit of economic pressure and sanctions, then china will come to and improve its like treatment of tibetans, and we don't understand where he gets this confidence. Maybe we can say that sanctions arguably have helped bring iran to the negotiating table and and close the nuclear deal, but like and also hear the like the how effective were the sanctions is a very questionable thing, but china is not iran. It is much more powerful, it is much bigger and stronger. So a better comparison would be russia. Now, we need to ask ourselves, where this like did the sanctions applied on russia work in making it less aggressive in its foreign policy, or less prone to human rights abuses, and the answer here is a loud and clear no. So there is no reason to think that the average tibetan is going to gain something out of these economic sanctions. What we also must understand is that china is super sensitive to anything pertaining to its territorial disputes. The one-china policy in which the people's republic of china demands that whoever has diplomatic ties with her, with it, will disconnect will like not engage in any type of diplomatic relations with taiwan, is a testament to just how sensitive they are. The core tenant of the chinese foreign policy is that, like, we don't intervene in your internal affairs and you should respectively butt out of our domestic affairs as well. China will not take kindly to what side government is proposing, not one bit, and it's not unreasonable to think that they will retaliate by making conditions that much harder for tibetans. And then daniel tells us oh, we shouldn't worry, it's not a problem because china is economically dependent on the american purchasing power. Well, the reality is that china is projected to surpass america as the world's leading economic superpower by two thousand eighteen, and this dependency in the US, if it exists, cuts both ways. Because daniel seems to have forgotten that the united states is vastly indebted to chinese creditors, creditors that can, at any moment, claim their debt. This means huge huge trouble for the US economy. So, to wrap it up. The fact that the struggle of tibetans is a righteous one doesn't mean that it will be justified to fight alongside them. It has no justification if it only leads to worse outcomes. Please oppose.
There's one thing that the previous speaker neglects to tell us about state-run lotteries and that is that the the participation sum that people have to pay is very low and that matters, actually, because it mitigates a lot of the harms that they talk about. So, the previous speaker talks about how like he talks about drawing in addicted people and how this takes away money from the poor and so on and so forth. But think about it for a second. How many people have you heard of that have gone truly bankrupt because of addiction to the lottery? There are no such people. Like even if for years, I have like been participating in a lottery every single week, yes, this does add up to a pretty significant amount, but the fact is that most people spend much more on cigarettes than they do on their weekly lottery tickets. So, true, it's usually not the top ten percent that are like the base clientele of lottery and but we need to be honest, we need to to say that these are not homeless people or or like people that are starving for bread as well. We're talking about hardworking people that are hoping to turn their life around, but it's very unlikely that they will reach a situation where they have to sell their property in order to afford their next lottery ticket. So we need to put things at the proper proportions. So what's interesting to us about the speech of the previous speaker is that he tells us that he is not intending to ban casinos or private lotteries and to me that is confusing, because the the harms that he mentions happen in a much more significant way as a result of those things. In casinos, there are actually people that can lose thousands of dollars in a in like a few single hours. This just cannot happen with the lottery. There's also far less supervision. People can get into serious debts that are crippling to them and to their families, and often get tangled up with like folks from the underworld and the and the mafia. All of these things don't concern the government too much. So, in fact, we think that it's government run lotteries that might help people to avoid ever having to reach a situation where they turn to these casinos, especially if we're talking about people who love to gamble and might even have an inclination to get addicted to it. We say that lottery provides for them an outlet that satiates this urge to gamble. If we keep casinos running but cancel the lottery, then it's quite obvious that whoever faces gambling issues will immediately turn to casinos, where things can end up far worse for them. Regarding the point that was brought up on how this takes away money from the poor and gives only some of it back to them, we actually think that like we disagree. We think that that the lottery is quite a nice model. Again, we would remind that we are talking about a like relatively very like a symbolic sum that's being spread upon millions of people, but then every single week, there is one man that gets to win the jackpot and his life gets like he gets his life completely turned around. In addition, we are not discounting the fact that this gives hope to a lot of people that have it rough in life. So even if most chances are against them, this still gives them something to hold onto by the end of a long working week. We disagree with side government that this is an irrational model or an like or that it does no use to anybody. It doesn't benefit the poor. We say that the emotional benefits that they get from having some like glimmer of hope, and we say that the fact that every single week there's one person that's will never be poor anymore in life, we say that these things matter. So for all these reasons, oppose the motion.
I think it's important to establish something right off the bat. This debate has not been defined to be from the personal perspective of the pope or of the catholic church. Therefore we need to look at the question whether it would be preferable to live in a world in which the celibacy vow would be abandoned or not. We think that the answer is no and this is not because like it's good that priests remain celibate, but simply because the organization of the catholic church has very limited political capital for core changes in their tenants of their faith and we believe that there are other changes that are far more pressing and important. Before we go to explaining this let's answer the points that were brought up by the previous speaker. So first they talk about how this gets young men not to turn to to priesthood and brings the situation where there are incompetent priests. So the first answer to this would be that like the fact that we're losing some of the most competent potential priests doesn't mean that we are stuck with completely incompetent morons right? So it's unclear to us why specifically a priest is like a title that requires special merit? Like only the best and the finest for for things to work. Why do all of the good things that james mentions cannot happen even if we have our second or third priority priests? I don't understand this. With a bit of experience we are quite confident that things will turn out okay even if you didn't get your first pick. Second answer is like even if you don't accept this, even if you think that this will end up badly for the catholic church, we do not run this debate from the perspective of what's good for catholicism. Therefore we just don't care so much. We say okay so in the worst case there are going to be a like a few less competent people in church but then the market gains more competent people in other roles that will have a positive impact on on other people outside the catholic community. Like we that sounds perfectly fine to us. The second thing that they say is that this is a like a rule that meant for for like meant to be broken. That it's going to be hard for these for young people to understand the long term consequences and it's likely that they will break their vows and that's bad because their talents get wasted and this will cause people to live to leave the community. Here again, we simply aren't too concerned about people turning away from the church. In fact, we think that there's a lot of advantages to that to to people leaving the the catholic church both personally to these people and to society as a whole but we're not getting into this. Like eventually we're just going to say that had the strength and stability of the catholic community really been a concern, we are not entirely sure that most people will respond with patience and understanding to such a drastic change in their long standing tradition. We think that like if that's what james cares about then we would say that it's very likely that people will leave the church and it's going to be less stable after the vow of celibacy is abandoned. Finally to the constructive points. So like any other organized religion catholicism is based on symbolic customs and traditions. This is like ninety percent of their appeal. That's what helps them preserve their like hold of the public. That doesn't mean that religions cannot evolve with time and the traditions cannot change, but this does mean that there's a limit to how much could be changed within a certain period of time. Therefore, abandoning the vow of celibacy is mutually exclusive with other potential changes that are currently discussed within catholic circuits like ordinating women priestess, like supporting the the use of contraception, like embracing LGBT's, like supporting adoption, like given the limited political capital, we have to prioritize these changes and in our opinion, the issue of celibacy isn't ranked as high on the list. Even that the harms that we've heard from the previous speaker can't really seriously be compared to the harms that that result from opposing contraception for instance and for this reason we say that for now, we need not touch the vow of celibacy. So please oppose the motion
Blood donation shouldn't be mandatory. First, we think there's a massive problem with james' model. He says that it'll be after natural disasters and similar situations, but the problem is that this is just going to impact the people who are already affected by those disasters even more, because you're going to be asking people to donate after a hurricane, and you're going to be asking people in the vicinity because you're going to have to be able to get that blood out to those who need it most faster, and also because of the arguments that james lists about how blood isn't actually stable for super long. And these are going to be the people who'll be simultaneously burdened with massive blows to their livelihood and family, so we think it is unfair to ask them to donate blood at the situations even more than the unfairness we're going to describe later about mandating it more generally. So, already, we think that james has started this debate with a massive disadvantage, because he's basically saying: you, the people who have suffered the most because of these kinds of crises, give up more of yourself, give up more energy that you probably need at this moment in order to donate blood. Look, our side of the house is really willing to heavily encourage and support blood donations, but we think it is really problematic to ever mandate it. Three arguments: first, on autonomy. Recognize that blood donation does have a lot of impacts on the donor. James pretends that it's like a low blood sugar strike and a pint of blood, but we think this is actually not the case, right? Like, you're not able to do strenuous activity. Like a lot of people get really bad reactions. They get really dizzy, they get nausea, and it can put someone out of commission up to a few days after doing this kind of process. And we think that, also, government needs to fundamentally respect citizen autonomy. This will always trump james' arguments about the utilitarian calculus, because utilitarianism is an awful underlying framework for how we should do things. Because you're always going to be willing to sacrifice individual people when you think you have a greater good in mind, but the person who adjudicates greater good is going to be the government or whatever body makes these decisions, not the individuals who are part of it. This is why we have overlying principles: because we know that utilitarianism can be used to justify a lot of awful things just because you're going to be helping a majority of people or something similar, but you don't want to enter those kind of fields. You can't go sacrificing all of these autonomy like and all of these people's rights for the sake of other citizens. This creates a slippery slope, because there are a million limits to individual autonomy that could help the general population but we don't agree with it, because it's still rights violative, and that's a principle that ought prevail. Having slaves generates a lot of income for the government that can benefit society, but we don't do that because preventing protecting people's rights is more important. So even if donating blood might not seem like a big deal to james, he has to acknowledge that there are other people out there for whom this is a big deal, not just a pint of blood and some water. It's also their time, other side effects, the religion they have to compromise. It's usually also not a matter of saving someone's life since the way that medical triage works is that people who need it most will get blood first. So, if anything, this is just a moderate discomfort for someone until blood does come up. Like, in modern western liberal democracies, it's pretty rare that someone dies because of lack of blood. Our second argument is about political consequences. We think you're setting a dangerous legal precedent: the idea that you can just force people to give up personal parts of themselves for the benefit of others, the idea that it's okay to mandate invasive procedures and then collect that information about someone. Like, yeah, we acknowledge that shortages can be a problem, but we don't think they're a problem for long, right? We're in the process of inventing synthetic blood. We can encourage individual people choosing to give blood on their own to increase the net net amount that is available and, like, stress this especially during crises, if that's what james is worried about. Like, it's possible to have enough without forcing people to donate. Our third argument is about privacy. Giving that blood up means that you're going to be tested for a lot of diseases, and a lot of information comes out of that. So we think that it's really important to prevent people from being stuck in those kinds of situations where they feel like they have to give up private information to a government body. Proud to oppose.
Don't end mandatory retirement. We are not opposed to doing things like raising the retirement age to mitigate a lot of tim's harms. Tim is worried about them needing money, but we also think there are a lot of sectors that usually take individuals who are retired, so these people can still work as things like librarians, security guards, hospital greeting staff, etcetera. We just shift them to less intensive sectors. And tim says that this misuses their experience, but we think that it's just true that when you get older, there are skills you don't acquire that are more necessary than the skills that you had before. Sure, you might be someone who has a lot of wisdom to share, but that just means that you might be a really good teacher, it doesn't mean that you can keep up with rising technology or the rising needs of your workspace. So I don't think that he actually brings you any real argumentation about why these people are more qualified than those who are recent graduates, who have more on-hand experience and have grown up with the technology that these individuals have only lived long enough to see the beginning of. Tim spends a lot of time raging against age-based restrictions more broadly, but we think that age-based restrictions are good approximations of other qualities, especially because it's impossible to test efficiently for the other metrics that tim is talking about. As the US government, you need some shortcuts in order to not waste a lot of resources on individual testing. At the end of the day, it is ridiculously unfeasible to test every single old person, like, maybe annually or, like, even if it's every two years, so that you can selectively take out the ones who are beginning to show signs of cognitive failure. We'd rather have a broad policy that might be a little bit unfair in some cases, rather than put so much stress, both financially and like bureaucratically, on the government. Two main arguments: first, on making sure that the youth have jobs. We're fine with being a little bit unfair to older workers if we can help those who are younger and have not established themselves yet. Sure, it sucks that sometimes people are forced into retirement before they are ready, but this reflects the weighing of a more important need of society. Young people are more central to the functioning of society and larger economic systems than those who are older, first, because there are a lot more economic safety nets in place for those who are older. Things like social security and medicare are perfect examples of things that older people will have access to when forced into retirement that young people struggling to find a job simply don't. Moreover, a lot of older people have younger family members who can sustain them in a way that a younger individual doesn't have if they are struggling. We live in a time where the job market generally is pretty slim. We need to prioritize making sure that younger populations are getting jobs. Old people are keeping a lot of their jobs and preventing them from being available or competed for, and this is especially since younger people keep the economic sphere going in other ways. They are the ones who continue to contribute to social security, have more years to do that. We rely on them to have the next generation of children, which happens more safely if they have a job. Our second argument is about keeping efficient systems. There's a point where any old person, even the one in the best mental and physical shape, is going to be worse at their job than someone who is younger. This is because the technology changes, the rules shift, the language shifts. Although someone older might be able to keep up with this reasonably, it will be objectively less efficient than someone younger. We need to give companies a way to cycle into more into this more efficient system. Without mandatory retirement, it can be really hard to get rid of older people, even when they aren't underperforming. They can do things like sue for ageism and are often entrenched socially, because they've been there so long. So it's hard to fire them, simply because they're friends with everybody. We think that this is a useful excuse for companies that we want to maintain. Proud to oppose.
We should not abandon television. I think that what sam really fails to do in his last speech is prove any unique harm of television. So I'm going to first explain why the laziness caused by television is non-unique and then respond to his argument about niches, also by proving that this is non-unique. I don't think you can go after television and say we should ban this one type of media when all of the harms sam identifies are common to other types of media as well. So, first, sam says that television makes people lazy, that they just want to sit on the couch and not do anything. But I don't think that television uniquely causes this. If people are tired after a long day at work, maybe that means that people work too much. If people feel too exhausted to participate in community organizations, maybe it's because they don't have enough leisure time, because americans actually work more today than we did fifty years ago. I'd also like to point out that this isn't unique versus other types of screen time. I don't actually watch TV. Like very seldom do I sit down on the couch and watch TV, but I spend way too much time after work every day staring at my phone or my laptop. It's just a different screen. My behavior physically isn't any different, right? I'm still not out and playing a sport or at the community club with my peers, I am at home being antisocial, looking at a screen. I don't see why television, the screen of the eighties, is so much worse than the screen of the twenty tens. At the end of the day, it's probably true that screen time is bad for people, but banning television isn't going to solve this problem, since sam himself admits that people will just turn to other types of screen in response. So there's no actual connection between banning television and solving any of the problems that sam identifies. But even aside from that, I'd like to point out that reading has many of the same problems, right? If you read, you sit in a chair and you don't move around, and you don't talk to other people, and you're not being social, but almost everyone agrees reading is a good thing. So I think maybe the issue here is the quality of what people are consuming but at that point, given there are plenty of garbage books and that there are some intellectually stimulating television shows, I think it's arbitrary to go after television, even if most television is objectively garbage. But our second point is about niches. Sam says that television kind of silos people into different groups and that this is bad. Books are much more segmented than TV. There are many more books published every year than TV shows made. There's more diversity of genre. There's hundreds of years of books for people to read from all different countries, whereas most TV is made in a few countries and has only been around for fifty or so years. So I think that any problem you want to identify with people being segmented based on their TV preferences is much worse with other types of media that are less expensive to produce and that have been around longer. So this isn't a reason to ban TV either, it's an argument against media as a whole and not a very compelling one. What's the harm in letting people consume different types of media? I'm unconvinced that this is why people join certain political groups. Surely, there are other influences too. This seems more about entertainment, and I'm not sure that any one type of entertainment is inherently worse than any other, as long as no one's being harmed in its production. But aside from that, I think the internet has done more to silo our communities and our society than television. Before the internet, there were relatively few media sources available, so everyone had to agree on certain common facts. Yes, it's true that fox news has challenged that to an extent in the US, but the fact remains that there's much less radicalism on television than the internet. Fox news is still much more mainstream than a lot of right-wing websites, for instance. So I don't see how you actually get less segmentation by banning TV, when most people get their news online anyway from even more radical sources. For all these reasons, we should not abandon television. Thank you.
We should not protect whistleblowers. On our side, we're going to explain to you why whistle blowers don't deserve unique protections, in direct response to the things that we've just heard from sam. The first thing that I'd like to point out is that sam relies on the assumption that whistle blowers act out of altruistic motives and that they exercise good judgment, but I think that even if one of those things is true, very rarely are both of them true. To use edward snowden as an example, I think most people would agree that edward snowden had altruistic motives, in terms of helping the american people, and that he uncovered a huge amount of maybe not corruption, but something that made the world very uncomfortable, and revealed it to the public, that he did a public service. The problem is that he exercised terrible judgment when he put out the documents. He had no idea what was actually in most of the documents he released. The same thing is true of chelsea manning. Most of the documents that she released she had no clue what was in them which, as a result, meant that information that was not putting anyone in danger, but which the release of which could put people in danger, was made publicly available. So we just don't think that whistle blowers tend to actually exercise good judgment. Why? Well, because the right thing and good judgment are both subjective, and we don't think it should be up to one cowboy to make the decision about what the public needs to know. Our second argument is that this leads to unequal access to information and actually makes it worse than the status quo. Why? Well, first of all, there's a huge incentive now to have this kind of political character assassination. If you work at a business that you don't like, then you can just go out and dump all of their private documentation to the public and reveal all the awful things they do, while other businesses that haven't had a whistleblower look comparatively better. So it's basically just a political decision which businesses are going to experience these leaks. It doesn't actually reflect who is the worst or who is doing things that the public needs to know about the most. And not only that, we tell you that this just favors businesses that are in countries with more restrictive laws. Right? If the US implements this policy and singapore doesn't, then this just favors businesses who do bad things and happen to be in singapore rather than the united states, just to use singapore as an example, not to pick on them. The last thing I'd like to talk about is why whistle blowers actually have basically no deterrent effect. Most of sam's argument relies on the idea that whistle blowers can make the world a better place, that they can force governments or companies to stop doing bad things, but I think that's empirically not the case. The NSA didn't stop spying on everyone because of edward snowden. He actually achieved nothing despite the fact that he destroyed his own life. The program continues unabated, except that a handful more governments now have access to some of that information. Similarly, probably the biggest example of a whistle blower going after private corruption, the panama papers, achieved absolutely nothing. The panama papers, if you've forgotten, because it wasn't a big news event, revealed that essentially every wealthy person in the world uses offshore accounts to avoid paying taxes, largely by going to countries like panama that are willing to turn a blind eye to people who are avoiding their taxes. Basically, every multimillionaire and billionaire in the world is doing this. What happened as a result of the panama papers? Absolutely nothing. Literally zero. Whistle blowers do not have the ability to stop companies from doing bad things. It's so easy for them to just run a PR campaign or just do nothing and wait, and the public will forget about what happened as soon as the news moves on to the next item in the news cycle. It's also fairly easy for companies to claim that they're being attacked unfairly, and we know for public opinion, even after a whistleblower has come out. We think that the public is a very fickle has a very limited ability to actually enforce change on private actors and that as a result, whistle blowers don't have a clear mechanism to enforce change on private actors. For all these reasons, we should not protect whistleblowers. Thank you.
Don't ban surrogacy. Right off the top, I want to address the idea that we're discouraging adoption, which danny keeps harping on and saying is so important. Even if it is the more moral option, we don't think the government gets to push this moral by banning surrogacy. We can encourage adoption in other ways and have all the benefits of surrogacy which we think are too important to forgo just because you want to nebulously increase adoption. Also recognize that danny doesn't prove the causality between this, right? Like we actually think that in general the people who are willing to adopt because of this mortal idea or because they're willing to do that personally are going to do so on both sides of the house. Like some people just really want children with their own genes and we think that that is okay. Moreover recognize that when he does this he places an arbitrary barrier on the idea of fertility that allows some people to access children of their own genes but forces other people to adopt on principle. And even if it might be the more moral thing to do, we think the fact that to so asymmetrical means it's bad to force it. With that three main arguments, first on the woman's choice. Danny talks on and on about this coercive nature and we just think that it is not more coercive than the majority of jobs available to individuals who are less educated. People are coerced into working generally because they have to make money, so there is no world in which I am not coerced into a job. Like I always take a job because I need to feed myself, even if I might like it at the same time. Let's use the example of a construction worker. If I take a low paying and dangerous job as a construction worker because I need to feed myself and I have no alternatives, that's because I've been coerced and there are millions of people who are in that situation and yet you don't see danny trying to ban every job. We just think this is a different kind of labor that is being exploited. And danny talks about how much of a burden it is to be pregnant but other jobs can present even worse burdens. On the same example of the construction worker, this is a job that can destroy your back, has a really high risk of injury, and will pay less and provide fewer benefits than surrogacy. Given that women are going to be coerced into working either way, we think you should give them the choice of which job and have this is one of the options. Moreover we do not think it is the right of the government to prevent women from being able to choose this. Women can conceptualize the potential harms and weigh that against the money and medical care they will receive. Most women who would do surrogacy are those who are either already have children or will have children soon anyway so this isn't some foreign concept to these women that the government needs to protect them from. Our second argument is about the economic empowerment of women. Look surrogacy pays and often it pays better than the alternatives. And this is good because it means that instead of doing some physical labor or having to stay at home, the alternatives for women without higher education in a lot of places these women could instead be surrogates, make more money than they would get from that other job, and usually not have to do as much hard labor. And then the money that they earn can be used for anything from furthering their economic cause in another way. In developing countries this might be buying an animal of some sort or like putting yourself in school so you can get a degree and it could also just go towards current quality of life. It also provides them with top notch medical care during the process since their kid is going to some rich rich person who wants a healthy child and this addresses the idea of complications because if they occur our side of the house takes care of them infinitely better than the other does. Our third argument is about why it's good for the economy. You just open up different market sectors, create different jobs in a variety of places, because it's not just the surrogates who get jobs from this, right? It's also about the facilities and the people who run them as well as all the bureaucracy around setting up adoption and managing the process. It puts money in the hands of people who often have less of it and now they can participate in that economy by buying goods and services and kind of like doing that whole downstream thing. Moreover we think the problem on government is often going to be that they don't actually have a way to enforce stopping surrogates. You just get shady, under the cover contracts in which surrogates are protected and not fully taken care of because the government can't actually track when this occurs. With that, proud to oppose.
We should not fight nationalism. On our side, we're going to explain to you why nationalism is actually something that's positive and why it's not something we need to fight against. To do this, we're going to respond to will's points, first, about conflict, and then about xenophobia. So, first, let's respond to what will tells you about nationalism leading to conflict. We think that if you try to fight against nationalism because it will lead to disagreement or disunity, you only favor groups who became nationalistic early on. Many states right now have nationalism that excludes minorities within their own boundaries. Russia's probably the best example of this. Russia has tons of ethnic minorities who aren't russian but who are still subsumed within the russian state. Will would tell you that because nationalism is bad, those groups shouldn't seek independence and their own self-determination. They should just be happy to live within a multicultural russia. But we think that this is really unfair to those groups, because it denies them the same opportunity to have their own states that people like georgians and armenians gained because they were nationalist a hundred years ago, whereas places like chechnya weren't. Yes, we think conflict is regrettable, but we think that the blame here is with the groups that refuse to allow minorities any sort of self-determination. Rather than fight against nationalism, we think that other groups need to be more respectful of it. We think that large dominant groups, like russians, need to understand the situation that minority groups are in and allow those groups to have self-determination. And I don't just want to pick on russia here either. This is a problem in other countries too, including western liberal countries like spain, were spaniards refuse to accept the fact that catalonians deserve the same right to self-determination that they have. Now it's true that there hasn't been as much violence in catalonia as in chechnya, but we still think that the problem is not with nationalism so much as with governments that refuse to cede any power to regional minorities. This leads to a huge bias in favor of the status quo that we think is atrociously unfair to many minorities who aren't able to live the way they would like to right now. And our second argument is in response to what will tells you about xenophobia. He essentially says that all nationalism is xenophobic, but we don't think this is necessarily true. First of all, we would tell you that in many countries, like argentina or canada or the US, or especially brazil perhaps, the national identity could incorporate new groups of people. It's true that many nationalists are racist, but we don't think that american nationalism is racist in itself against americans. We think that there are plenty of nationalist african americans, for instance, and I think that will is conflating two different things when he says that african americans are treated badly by some nationalists. We would tell you that, in fact, in many countries, people are able to use nationalism to prove that they are a member of that community. For instance, you have immigrant groups that celebrate the fourth of july very prominently and that disproportionately enlist in the military, because they want to prove that they're as american as anyone else. And this has the effect of incorporating those people more closely into the community because it gives them more in common with other groups. We think that this is one reason why the united states has been able to incorporate so many different immigrant communities over its history, and I think similar phenomena exist in many other ethnically diverse states in the new world. It's true that there are some countries where this isn't the case, where nationalism excludes people, like hungary, but I think that saying that nationalism overall is bad because some countries have toxic nationalism is a little bit far-fetched. We should try to have those countries incorporate more people into their nation rather than just say that nationalism, as a whole, is xenophobic, when plainly that isn't always true. For all these reasons, we should not fight nationalism. Thank you.
