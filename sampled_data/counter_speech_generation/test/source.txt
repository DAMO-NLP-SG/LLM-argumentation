Nationalism does more harm than good. What's important to recognize about nationalism right at the outset is that it doesn't arise from anything natural about the peoples that express nationalist attitudes. There's nothing about german nationalists or french nationalists or chinese nationalists that makes those types of groups uniquely combined to each other and in fact most of these groups grew out of a very distinct cultural subsections prior to the eighteenth century. For example in germany there was no german state prior to the eighteenth century. It was a conglomeration of many different german and frankish kingdoms that came together to form a modern state, and the modern state is about when these attitudes eventually arose within our society. So it's important to recognize that there's nothing fundamentally human about nationalism, there's nothing that combines these populations in any unique way. Between the fact that they neighbor each other and in some instances share cultural bonds though when you allow for nationalism and when nationalism arises in the way that it has in the last two centuries, it allows for new different cultural bonds to be formed which are frankly exclusive in many ways and most importantly arbitrary in their creation. They're simply made in order to enforce this idea of national identity and national community that doesn't exist and is often a tool of those empowered by nationalism to use that nationalism as a guise for fascism. But firstly, before I get on to that I think it's important to talk about why nationalism is simply a bad political force within the world. Nationalism by its definition is exclusionary. In order to celebrate a nation you must create distinctions between that nation and those around it and while some would argue for a cosmopolitan nationalism that allows for people to celebrate their nation simply because it's something that is diverse and beautiful, such as the united states and the idea of the melting pot, firstly, this isn't how nationalism actually arises in the world. Nationalism is more often in more often the case, nationalism is the force that says: my national identity group, my my ethnicity, my regional nation, any sort of group is is better than other groups that border me, or that there's something that makes them distinct that makes them superior. This false superiority creates a a sense of xenophobia throughout the world, which is one reason why there's, in the, in europe right now there's such a hesitancy to to accept refugees from syria, and from other war torn areas in the middle east and northern and northern africa. This is because there's this idea that there's some sort of benefits that we read from our nation that are exclusive the benefits for our nation. That because we are where we are we have earned the goods and resources that we get from these regions. But we only get these benefits because of the arbitrary nature of where we were born and what our region happens to have and what it can give us. There's no one more deserving of getting these sort of political goods whether it be a stable government or representative democracy than people that are fleeing to these areas as refugees. It's just the luck of where they were born. Given that this is the case we think that nationalism becomes an exclusionary political philosophy that only harms the most disenfranchised people like refugees, who are not able to access the goods that they desperately need. We also think that it creates divisions within a society itself. It means that people that have become part of this communities, say minority groups in in largely white european countries, feel excluded from their own society. Whether it's through ideas of nationalism that simply don't create an image of the nation that includes them, or it's more overt and direct threats. That come from largely far right groups that use nationalism as a guise for fascism. And this the other problem with nationalism. It's that when you create xenophobic senses within a state that creates this sort of false superiority that my nation is better than your nation, it allows for strong man leaders to stand up and say: I'm going to protect the nation. I'm going to ensure the nation rises to its former glory, and these sort of robust senses of pride in the nation allow for these people to get away with crimes and other sorts of corruption that allow them to enrich themselves while at the same time creating strong men groups that create serious threats to democracy not just in developed but also in not just in developing nations but also developed nations such as greece where the xri'si party is rising, and france with marine la pen, in england with braxit and with united states and donald trump. All of these people use nationalism as a way to try and fuel their political anger that their people feel and it only creates more divisions within our society which is frankly contradictory to the global ideas that have been set forth for the past for the past sixty or seventy years of post world war two, peace and prosperity that's occurred. For these reasons we think that nationalism has certainly done more harm than good.
We should raise the retirement age. So, for the purpose of the debate, we're going to create a model that we think is fairly simple, we recognize that when the retirement age was created it didn't exist in a similar time, so the life expectancy, when the retirement age based around social security was instituted, was much lower, so what you would do is we would tie it to what life expectancy was when the retirement age was first instituted. So, if whatever age it was, say it was sixty five, we would tie it to that, we would tie it to the same proportion of life that you would expect to have after retirement, based on the average, and from there we would just tie it to life expectancy moving forward, so if life expectancy goes up by two years, we would raise the retirement age in proportion to how much life you would expect to live after you retired, not based on your age per se, but based on expected retirement time. Okay, so, two two main arguments that we have in this debate. Firstly, we would say that this is a necessary thing to do, in order to protect the welfare benefits and other things that are so crucial, and so tied to retirement age. So recognized that, the problem that exists in the status quo is one, in which for the vast majority of the existence of mankind, the pyramid or the amount of people at each age group, so from zero to ten, from ten to twenty, from twenty to thirty, etcetera, essentially formed a pyramid where the vast majority of people on the bottom were under ten years of age, and the people at the top, the very few, were much smaller proportion. So, what's actually happening in the status quo is that, because of increased medical care, lowering birthrates, and all of these types of things, that pyramid pattern, that put a very few amount of people at the top, and a lot of people at the bottom, as far as age range, is actually straightening out. So, there are now many more people that are at the top, more people are living to be older, more people are able to collect the benefits of retirement, and all these things, whereas there are very few people now that are being born, compared to the proportion of elderly. What this means is that, all the systems, that we have devised, are based on the fact that you have a much larger working class of people than you do the amount of people that are retired, but that isn't the case anymore. There are now many more people that are able to collect retirement benefits than before, and while we recognize that retirement is something that people have earned, that they put their time in, and they deserve to have a time after they've retired to be able to live their life, to have the freedom to explore other things, to enter that new stage of life, it's important to recognize that, if we don't make a change now, people will not be able to receive the same welfare benefits they have before. People won't social security is due to take a drastic hit, because of higher life expectancy, and lower birth rates, and other sorts of welfare are doing the same. It also means that, the economic productivity of these people can last longer, because people are able to live longer, and because better medical care means you're able to do more at sixty two or sixty one than you were able to do fifty sixty years ago. It means that, their labor is value is valuable economically, and because we don't think that the retirement age is anything but an arbitrary line, we think we ought create a retirement age that best reflects a median, or a meeting point, between the ability for people to live meaningful lives after they've retired, but also the necessity for these people to contribute into welfare programs, so that current generations are able to receive those benefits. We think that everyone is entitled to those benefits, and without a drastic change occurring right now, it simply the case that in the future, people will not be able to collect the benefits and be able to retire at the same age. Given that this is, frankly, a necessity of changing demographics, and given that people will still be able to live a meaningful life post-retirement, given the rasing given the the mortality the raising life expectancy, and things of that nature. We think it's absolutely crucial that we raise the retirement age, and in fact we should raise the retirement age.
We should abolish the two-party system. So, by the two-party system, we mean something that exists in countries like the US or britain where, although other parties are legally permitted, only two parties ever control the government. In a country like the US, with a presidential system, this might mean that only two major parties exist, period, and in a country like britain, with the westminster parliamentary system, we think that it might mean that one of two parties always forms government, although sometimes in coalition with minor parties, and the other party always forms the loyal opposition. We think that the mechanism by which to abolish the two-party system should be to institute a preferential voting system. What we mean by this is that whereas in britain or the US, whichever candidate wins the majority of the votes in a district goes on to become the member of parliament or the senator. We would prefer a system in which people rank all of the candidates, and then the candidate that is ranked the most highly on aggregate goes on. And this would allow people to rank their first, second, third choice so that they wouldn't worry about the greater and lesser evil when they vote, but rather about their actual preferences. Three arguments for why we should abolish the two-party system. The first is about maximizing choice. In a country like britain, you're perfectly free to vote for parties besides the tories or labor, but one of the two is always going to win. What that means is even if you would prefer to vote for say, a trade union socialist, you will always vote for labor because if you don't, it means that you're throwing your vote away because the tories will be slightly better off because one labor voter hasn't voted for labor. On our side, you're perfectly free to rank that trade union socialist above the labor party candidate, but then put tory at the bottom of the list and ultimately, you will still end up with a labor member of parliament, but your actual preferences will be reflected, and it's much more likely that you'll actually see a third-party candidate get elected in some districts than what happens right now. This would mean that representation in parliament would reflect people's opinions more closely, and presumably that lawmaking and decision-making would reflect the will of the people better than it does in the status quo. Our second argument is that we think that this would better protect minority viewpoints. So recognize that in many countries, people vote largely along ethnic lines. In the US, for instance, we see that over ninety percent of african americans vote for the democratic party and large majority of hispanics as well, while predominantly white people vote for the republicans. We think that if you had a better voting system or multiple parties, then it would be easier for groups to form a party to represent their own interests. Right now there is no party that uniquely represents the interest of black americans in the house of representatives or the senate, because african americans have to vote for the democrats in order to be sure that the republicans don't win, the lesser evil thinking that I was talking about before. On our side, we think it's more likely that you would have minority political parties form that would uniquely protect the interest of these groups and that would advocate them for them better than these sort of big-tent parties are able to do. Because recognize that even if many black people are voting for the democrats, most democratic representatives are still white so they don't really understand what the community needs, whereas on our side, when you would institute this different voting system, you would be more likely to have black people elected to the house of representatives or the senate, and we think that this would hold true for other multicultural democracies as well. Our last argument is that this would encourage coalition building. In a country like the UK right now, even though, in theory, they have minority parties, the tories were able to form a government with no input from any other party, which means that the majority of people who didn't vote for the tories have no say in the government's policies. A minority effectively controls the majority, which is not the purpose of democracy. Some people in the audience may be groaning because their country has problems with coalitions forming, but we think that at the end of the day, it is always preferable to encourage people to work with those who think differently from themselves rather than to allow one ideological block to control the entire nation. So for these three reasons, we should abolish the two-party system. Thank you.
Global warming is a major threat. No matter what some may say in the media the vast majority of scientists agreed that global warming is not a natural occurring phenomenon in the way that it's currently occurring, and that global warming is due to man-made carbon emissions and other pollution that has been going on since the industrial revolution. There's a new spike in the global average temperature and every year new records are set that set the new high in regions all over the world and for the global temperature average generally. So, global warming is a threat that we face and it is man-made so there is something we can do about it. So why should we do something about it? It's important to recognize that at the current pace of which we are emitting carbon dioxide and other harmful things like methane into our atmosphere, we are on pace to have to reach a global tipping point in which the amount of carbon in the atmosphere forms of greenhouse effect that cannot be undone for hundreds of years. Something that will ensure that generations upon generations that follow us will be forced to deal with the impacts that I'm going to talk about right now. There are a few major impacts of global warming that have serious and detrimental impacts on human life. The first of those is that global warming means that global that polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate and that global freezing occurs at lower rate during the winter, which means that normally there is now higher sea levels across the globe as well as more erratic weather patterns. What do those things look like? Well firstly, on a small scale in the status quo we can see that rising sea levels are causing populations to be harmed. Islands in the pacific ocean that are habited are starting to sink entirely meaning that entire countries are going to be underwater in a number of years. Forcing, in the status quo, small amounts of immigration and refugee problems but in the future, as water water levels continue to rise, even developed nations are going to be forced to deal with the fact that cities, major metropolitan areas are going to be underground. And there are going to be massive immigrant and refugee crises that individuals and countries are going to need to deal with moving forward if we do nothing about this. But furthermore it's important to recognize that once nations go underground and these metropolitan areas go underground, you lose massive historical and cultural landmarks that are tied to our human existence and to the identity that we feel as a collective humanity and that not only is there a loss of life and loss of property, but also a life a loss of history when we allow the sort of patterns to continue. So, on top of the fact that cities are going to be under water on coastal areas, these global warming causes erratic problems with the weather generally. Global warming, the name itself is somewhat misleading because it's not just the facts in the world is getting warmer but it's also the fact that weather patterns are getting more erratic, which is why you may have very warm temperatures come in the winter, but you get really strong storms coming in times when you wouldn't expect them, such as the spring and and things such as blizzards that mean that agricultural patterns are harmed in dramatic way which in developing nations can cause serious problems such as drought which means that many people simply aren't being fed and what we are seeing is that in those developing nations in particular, there is a massive increase in drought and a massive increase in famine that everyone is going to have to deal with. This is another additional factor that could lead to those refugee crises that are already wrecking europe in the status quo and are only continue are only going to continue to cause political problems moving forward. But these also have impacts on developed countries. Blizzards, earth and more major storms such as tornadoes and hurricanes that rack the that rack developed nations as well such as the united states, still have massive detrimental impacts even with the infrastructure that these countries have in order to survive these storms. This means that the worst of in society, both in developed and developing nations, are going to continually going to be harmed because in large part corporations, large agro businesses are causing these toxic waste to be poured into our atmosphere and into our waste, into our water supplies which is causing these harms to exist in the first place. We think that it's reprehensible that society allows these things to happen these gains for the top to happen, when it causes global warming affects that not only impact those that are existing right now, the worst off in developed and developing nations but also because of the tipping point, are going to continue going to impact people for generations. On top of the fact that pollution and warming causes impacts for the animal populations as well, causing mass extinctions of people or animal populations in the status quo that again, just like the tipping point cannot be reversed. Given that our current trajectories going to lead to these impacts happening, it is almost guaranteed by science, we think that global warming is a major threat that must be dealt with immediately.
We should protect the antarctic continent. So by this we mean that antarctica should be made an international nature reserve where nobody is allowed to drill for oil or minerals, or exploit the wildlife, or whatever other resources may exist on the continent. And on top of that, we think that under the scope of protecting it, it should be considered as international property in the same way that the open ocean is in the status quo. So with that in mind, we have three arguments for you. The first is about antarctica as the last major wilderness. So this is the last big territory that hasn't been exploited for resources yet because technology hasn't made it possible to do so up until the current day. Recognize that the value of antarctica as a wilderness is irreplaceable. After you have exploited virgin land, it can never go back to its original state. Any damage that you do is likely to be permanent especially with things like mineral extraction that can fundamentally change the shape and lay-out of the landscape. We think that there are probably unknown benefits and bounties to this continent that we can't exploit right now. We think that if you destroy the local biodiversity and things like that, they will never be able to be replaced because once those things are gone, there simply gone and we can't recover them and that since we don't know what their benefits might be, we should leave them for posterity. We think it's important that future people have every bit as much of a claim to use antarctica as current people and that the most responsible way to use it, therefore, is to act as stewards rather than as miners or exploiters. We all should we also think that it's important to avoid past mistakes. At other times in history when people have discovered new continents or had technology open up previously inhospitable regions, the first thing that they've done is stolen everything they could and taken it back to the places where we already live. We think that this has drastically damaged the ecosystem in places like alaska or the american west and that we should learn from those mistakes and not do the same thing in antarctica. We should plan carefully how will interact with it and the best way to ensure that this happens is to treat it as a nature reserve in the meantime. Our second point is about reducing conflict. So recognize that right now it's really unclear who antarctica belongs to and what part of antarctica belongs to what countries. There is a group of very complex and conflicting international claims to different parts of the continent. Argentina, chile, britain, norway, the US, russia, all claim different parts of antarctica for their own and many times these conflicts or claims overlap. We think that as oil and other minerals are discovered in antarctica, there's likely to be a lot of conflict. Up to the early twenty-first century there wasn't conflict over antarctica because it was basically worthless ice and it was only claimed because it was convenient to do so. But if there's suddenly hundreds of billions of dollars worth of oil, hypothetically, discovered then we think countries are going to go to war, potentially, over that resource especially as mineral resources become more scarce in more easily accessible locations. Without limitations and treaties and plans about how to deal with antarctica, rudimentary steps have been taken in this direction but enough we think. Without these steps, we think that ultimately you are more likely to have conflict in the future and antarctica will simply go to the strongest rather than be allocated fairly. So I think that on our side, what we promote is a world in which countries should be able to share equally in the bounty of antarctica, rather than have strongest countries take everything for themselves our last claim is about urgency. We think that antarctica is becoming more and more accessible due to global climate change and rising temperatures and due to increases in technology. So recognize that right now most of the continent is hidden under an ice cap but it seems that in the next couple hundred years the ice cap is going to melt and all of that land will suddenly be exposed to the surface for the first time in thousands of years. We think that it will be very easy for countries at that time to exploit resources that right now are very inaccessible. We also think there will be great demand for easy to use resources at that time since places like the US and russia by that time we'll have had many of their resources exhausted. We think, therefore, that it is urgent to deal with the problem of antarctica right now before it is possible to access the resources. Once people are already mining or drilling on the continent, we don't think it's going to be easy to make them stop and we don't think it would be just to overturn existing property claims. We need to act before those claims are actually state. If the ice caps are going to melt, we need to have plans to deal with this in place and on our side we think that the best way to do that is to promote international cooperation and to prevent exploitation of these resources until some sort of plan is in place. So for these reasons we think it's clear that we should protect the antarctic continent. Thank you.
The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce goal-line technology. What we mean by this is that we would mandate that all levels of the game above those played for children below the ages of probably sixteen to like anything above the high school, middle school elementary school level would require the use of goal-line technology. With that two main areas of clash, first on sticking to the spirit of the game. Recognize that fairness is one of the most important things in a game insofar as it allows individual players to play the game and like play you to the fullest extent because they know or have a belief that the system is going to be fair to them. No one is going to engage in a sport or an activity where they know they are doomed to fail and people get bored easily if they know they are doomed to win. But even if you don't buy that individual players require fairness to exist, it's really important for fans as well in order to enjoy the sport. The only reason that sports exist are because people like them whether it's playing them or watching them and the way in which both players and fans get enjoyment out of it is by the knowledge that referees can be trusted and that individual players are relying on their skill to win a game and not just whether or not the referee likes them or whether or not they're like in a particular bracket and they've been like paid off to lose or win. So when a game is unfair the players' skills undermined and both the players and the fans are unhappy. Goal-line technology is an incredibly easy solution to maintaining the integrity of the game and it also maintains the speed of the game which we think is also an element that individuals really appreciate when it comes to sports. Insofar as one of the reasons that I want to go to sports games for that rush of adrenaline to keep up with it so I think that the speed is actually very integral to like why we enjoy sports and why sports as an institution are like agreeable as well. Instant replay which is the current technology to check grey-area goals takes a really long time to go through and pauses the game significantly, during which time fans get bored players like get out of their adrenaline rush and we really think that like all in all it doesn't benefit anyone because one minute of game can take over twenty minutes to analyze by instant replay. And we think a really solution for that really easy solution for that is goal-line technology that just kind of indicates whether or not the line was line was crossed. We think that it's a really easy solution. But our second area of clash is the way in which it interacts positively with referees. First in assisting the good ones. Recognize that this technology doesn't make referees obsolete. Refs are still needed to oversee the rest of the game and make the obvious calls or the ones that they're certain about. But this is assists in times when it seems like there is a gray area. This is better than both the human eye and video playback insofar as both of those still depend on the perspective of the individual viewing them or the perspective of where the camera is placed and because the ball often overshadows the line you can never see if it definitively cost center or not. Like maybe it's three quarters of the way through as compared to one half and it's really difficult to discern with like any version that relies on the human being to see it. We think that whether or not a team gets a point should not depend on the angle and distance of the referee. We also think that it allows good referees to maintain their integrity in situations where the fans might be yelling oh no well like we really think this is crooked this is a really easy way in which you can check against that and allow referees to say look I'm not lying like clearly and we think that casting doubt on a referee's call is a really easy way to take away the like integrity of that team or that referee and so we think that creating mechanisms that can check fans against like good referees and make sure that no one is like being is like ruining someone's reputation for no reason is really positive. But we also think that it provides a meaningful check against bad referees because bad referees either because they have poor eyesight or because they're like they're crooked or because they're biased against a team exist and this makes sure that they can't get away with making calls that impact the game during their time as referees and so we think that it's like very positive when you have a failsafe metric that like allows us to eliminate human error. For these reasons, proud to propose.
We should adopt the metric system because adopting the metric system would just make a lot of sense. It's easy thing to do. It would allow wider applicability of like measuring skills for american citizens and, moreover, it's honestly a pretty easy transition. So, let's begin by talking about why transitioning to the metric system just makes sense, why it's like a a good thing to do. And the biggest reason is it's just like the the metric system just makes more sense than the customary system. The metric system everything is like a multiple of like ten or a hundred , so if you want to convert something from, say, like, millimeters to meters, to kilometers, or similar, from like grams to kilograms, everything is like a multiple of ten or like a multiple of like based on the way that it works. So, you can just kind of like move add more zeros or move a decimal around and , once you like understand the the basic differences in the system, you can convert between different measurements pretty easily. And that just means that it's a a more it's an easier system to use. You can measure things out more quickly and effectively. The customary system is absolute nonsense. Every measurement is like completely different. Like you got like x amount of inches makes a like twelve inches makes a foot, however, who I don't even know how many feet make a yard. And I don't even know how many yards make a mile or whatever, because it's like probably some nonsense number, like three hundred and twenty four or something like that. And it's the same for all of these. Like it's the same for every part of the system, like like why does it like like why does twelve inches make a foot, but sixteen ounces makes a pound? It doesn't make any sense. Because people just like it's just like these random numbers that don't really have any kind of like actual meaning. It's designed just to be unnecessarily complicated. So whenever people need to do conversions or transfer between units or anything like that, it's probably pretty difficult to do it in your head. You probably need to like waste time using your phone, looking it up, doing all these other kinds of things, because you can't really do it all that effectively. And you're like more likely going to make mistakes. You're going to be less efficient and effective. So those are all reasons why just the metric system is a superior system. The next point that I want to make, though, is that it just has wider usage. If you like you can travel anywhere in the world and they're going to use the metric system, not the stupid customary system, so that's useful. If you're going to like do any kind of international study, like study abroad or research abroad or something like that, they're also going to use the customary system the, sorry, the metric system. So, it's really like a is a it's a useful skill to have if you plan on traveling anywhere, being more of a global citizen. But the final argument that I want to make is that the transition would honestly be really easy. Like, sure, there's probably like some like eighty year olds who aren't really going to be learning anything new anytime soon, because they're old, but if you start now, if you start teaching people the metric system in schools, people'll probably pick up on it pretty quickly. It's a lot easier than the customary system which we already learned in school. So I think that like kids would pretty easily be able to learn it in schools. Most people would probably start doing it, especially if they had to like read signs and read measurements and things like that in the other way. Since it's not so hard to learn, I think you probably get a lot of compliance with this. So for all those reasons, we should adopt the metric system.
We should ban foreign workers. On our side, we think that countries should ban companies from bringing in laborers from abroad to specifically fill a job. We're fine with people immigrating through regular means but we would get rid of things like skilled worker visas or agricultural labor visas that are very common in countries like the US and britain and many other countries around the world. We have two main arguments for our side. The first about the effect these workers have on wages and the second about the brain drain of their home countries. So first, why do these workers depress wages? The labor market like every other market operates according to the principle of supply and demand. If there's a very limited number of workers, then companies will have to pay them more in order to get the workers that they want because the they just have fewer people to choose from and there's greater demand for those workers that are available. This is one reason why countries like the US and britain and germany had very high wage growth in the mid twentieth century. After world war two there was a huge demand for labor but at that time you were limited to a domestic labor market. As a result they had to pay relatively high wages, offer good benefits, offer pensions in order to attract workers because if they didn't their workers could just go work somewhere else. There was a very high demand for labor which gave more power to workers relative to their employers. We think that one reason why wages have largely stagnated in the last forty years in western countries and why benefits have declined or completely gone away in for many people is that there's now a much greater pool of workers for companies to draw on. Nowadays if you don't want to pay the wages of an engineer in california you can either outsource that job or bring someone to the united states to do that job for them. We think that ultimately this is very harmful because it depresses wages and undermines the ability of workers to represent themselves against companies because they lose all leverage if they can just be replaced with someone from abroad. And our second argument is about brain drain and why this practice is bad for countries like china and india where many of these workers are brought in from. If you have a situation where companies in india can only afford to pay let's say twenty five thousand dollars to an engineer and companies in california are paying two hundred thousand dollars for the same job, just to make some numbers up, it's obvious that the best workers from india are going to try to go get those jobs in california or at least many of them will. As a result, countries like india lose their best and brightest students. This is really bad for a few reasons. One, because in order for those countries to develop they need to have their own capital including human capital remain in the country. Effectively you can reinvest educated workers in your economy just like any other form of capital. If you have really well trained, smart, hard working engineers than your economy will grow more quickly than if those engineers go to america and grow the american economy. But moreover, countries like india are investing a lot in education but they're not reaping all of the returns because the best students are going to america or going to europe or singapore and places like that in order to get higher wages. So when we allow western countries or when western countries choose to basically import the best workers from places like india and china, not only are they harming their own workers but they're also limiting development in those countries. We think that this is a really bad thing because it means that standard of living is going to increase more slowly in those countries because you need a larger economy in order to support a higher standard of living and moreover, because it means that some countries will be trapped at their current standard of living if all of their best people are leaving. For all of these reasons, we should ban foreign workers. Thank you.
Sex education should be mandatory. When we're talking about sex education, we want to be quite clear. When we say sex education, we mean comprehensive sex education, sex education that teaches about both STDs and the different types of contraception that are available to individuals, how to use these types of contraception. We think it would be a broad type of course taught early in high school, probably for an entire year, and we think that the curriculum itself, as far as specifics, could be set by a panel of doctors and other experts in the field, rather than being set by politicians, we think it should be set by individuals that are most informed, a combination of education and health experts that could work together in forming the curriculum that is most likely to reduce the the amount of unwanted teenage pregnancies and the amount of STDs. Okay. So why do we think that there is a responsibility for the government to educate, specifically when it comes to sex education. Well, firstly, there's a recognized responsibility from the government to educate its populace in all other aspects. So, almost every developed every developed nation, almost every nation, has some form of public education. Because it's recognized that in order to have a functioning society, you need to have a well-educated populace, and that parents simply are not equipped, both because they simply don't have the time to teach their their their youth, their children, the that the wide array of things that people need to be able to know in order to function in society, and because they themselves are not personally equipped, are not experts, do not have the capabilities of educating young people. We don't think that sex is any different. While sex is something that is incredibly personal, the ability to do your accounting, to understand your finances, to be physically fit, these are things that are also incredibly personal, yet we say the state has a responsibility to ensure that these things are taught amongst young people. We also think that parents are not qualified in teaching sex education. While many people may think it is the responsibility of parents to sit down with their children and, quote unquote, have the talk, we think that it's clearly the case that parents, in many respects, do not have the knowledge of how contraceptives are used. They don't have the knowledge about how STDs work and how they spread, or how to understand that you may have one or to be able to recognize these things, and they don't know about the advances in contraceptive, the most advanced scientific understanding of these things. Given that this is the case, sex is something sex and sex education is biological, it's something that can be understood through science, through education. Just because it is something that is personal, doesn't mean that it's not something that can be broken down and given education to people. So, we also think that sex is crucial for personal development and well-being, more so than many other subjects that are taught in school, and there are huge risks that are associated with not having sex education. In places in the united states in which sex education is not provided, or abstinence-only sex education is provided, these are the areas that have the highest rates of STDs and the highest rates of unwanted pregnancy. And what it shows is that regardless of whether or not the government decides to step in and decides to educate people about sex, people are going to choose to have sex. Young people are going to want to explore their sexuality and are going to want to do these types of things. The only difference, and what this debate is really about, is whether we want children, whether we want young people getting their information from less reputable sources, getting it from older siblings or from parents who simply don't have the scientific knowledge, or worse yet, getting it from places like pornography or the internet, in which anything can be put out, mostly things that are false, things that simply aren't proper representations of sex, sexuality and contraceptive usage. We think that given that the alternative to having comprehensive sex education is people continuing to have sex, but having less safe sex which creates immense harms not only on them as individuals but also on society. When we are forced to bear the burden of their health cost, forced to bear the burden of unwanted children in our orphanages and through our welfare systems, these are things that clearly have immense social impacts. We think that sex is crucial to someone's personal development, and not being given a proper sex education is a risk that the government should not be willing to take, it's not something that should be acceptable in our society. And for these reasons, sex education should be mandatory.
The right to internet access should be protected. By this we mean that people around the globe should inasmuch as there is infrastructure have access to the internet in a relatively unfiltered way. We're okay with things like limiting access to adult content for children but broadly speaking, we think that adults should one, be able to access the internet and two, be able to access whatever content they want on that internet. Three arguments for this. First, freedom of speech and assembly. We think that in today's globalized age with the internet access to online materials has become an integral part of both the traditionally protected rights of freedom of speech and of assembly. Why is this so? So in terms of freedom of speech, many of the most important fora in the world for discussion are now online. People don't really exchange physical newsletters anymore or subscribe as much to physical journals or magazines. They rely on the internet for access to this type of information. So when you limit the right to internet access and you limit the right to choose what you consume on the internet you're limiting people's right to consume the speech of others and to expose others to their own speech in a way that would be unacceptable offline and in terms of freedom of assembly, we think that there are many important communities online and that people ought to have right to access to. Even if we think, for instance, that it's distaste for people to join certain political groups we think that if they would have the right to join those groups in person, they ought to be able to affiliate with them online and those organizations web pages will not be banned and people should be facilitated in joining them. In the same way that we have roads and things like that to facilitate people participating in freedom of assembly in the physical world. The other team needs to explain to you what the fundamental difference is between physical space and cyberspace and I don't think that they'll be able to do so. Our second argument is about how this is a check on government abuses. What the arab spring has shown us is that when regimes are abusive the internet offers a powerful check on them. People before the internet might have felt like they were the only ones who are experiencing some sort of prejudice or like there wasn't a critical mass of people who were unhappy with the government. They lacked a tool to organize. They lacked the ability to see what the rest of the world was like in order to know if their treatment was commonplace or acceptable. With the internet you were able to see things like the organization of mass protest in countries like tunisia and egypt in a few hours. Thirty years ago, it would have taken days and days maybe even weeks to organize a protest with a hundred thousand people, but today with technology like twitter it's possible to do it in a matter of hours. We tell you that this is a huge threat to autocratic governments that don't treat their people well. The knowledge that with the internet people will be able to protest. Internet access should be guaranteed so that governments have to treat their people well lest they be afraid of these protests or even of having their government toppled. The internet in other words keeps governments honest and we think that that is a good thing. Our last argument is that censorship is by its nature bad. We think that when you censure certain ideas that you don't actually challenge them you just make them hidden. People will think that those ideas must have merit and be dangerous because they're being censored. On our side of the house when we allow these ideas to be spoken openly, when we allow people to use the internet to engage with different ideas we think it's more likely that poor ideas are challenged and overturned rather than entrenched because they're banned. We think it's more likely that people will have a free exchange of ideas and that out of this marketplace of ideas you will have the best possible forms of government and society emerge. We concede that many cultures have become more liberal since the adoption of the internet and I don't necessarily mean that politically, but I mean in terms of tolerance. You see more acceptance of things like gay rights in the world today than you did before the internet and part of that is probably the ability to spread narratives about, you know, what gay people are really like and what they actually want from society rather than harmful narrative spread by the traditional media. With the internet more people can speak their voice and censorship that shuts that down such as limiting access to the internet will only be a bad thing only harm discourse. So for these reasons the right to internet access should be protected.
We should fight nationalism. So nationalism is the belief that one's country is superior to other countries and that people should organize and identify according to their nationality. So for instance, the belief that america is the greatest country in the world and much better than every other country, would be a very prominent example of this. I'm going to begin by explaining why nationalism is harmful and then move on to two ways that we can fight against it in a productive fashion. Nationalism short circuits people's ability to think critically about their country's actions. To use the united states as my example because I'm familiar with it, in the run up to the iraq war in order to prevent people from criticizing the war or pointing out that it didn't make sense in terms of keeping americans safe or financially, the bush administration encouraged people to think nationalistically. They presented saddam hussein as the enemy of the american people, whoever that may be, and as a threat to our way of life. Again, whatever that may be. All of this was completely groundless and saddam hussein actually had nothing to do with the nine eleven attacks but what's important is that by encouraging people to think in this kind of tribalistic way, bush and cheney were able to convince people to support a war that they had no business rushing into. Throughout history we've seen leaders stir up support for wars using nationalism as their primary strategy. We think that ultimately, the ability of nationalism to incite violence for people means that it is on balance always going to be harmful and we would prefer a world in which people identify based on their common factors with others rather than one were arbitrary lines on a map determine who gets human treatment and who does not. So that said, two ways that we can fight against nationalism in a productive fashion. The first is to promote multi-culturalism and immigration. It is much easier to think that people living in other countries are inferior or evil if you don't know anyone who was born or lived in a foreign country. On the other hand, if your next door neighbors are from one country and your other neighbors are from a third country and your boss grew up in another place, it's ultimately much more difficult for you to look down on people just because of their nation of origin because there's no facts backing up nationalism. People actually aren't better just because they were born in a given country. So by exposing people to different ideas and ideologies and to immigrants we think that you will ultimately reduce nationalism while also making your country stronger because we tell you that ultimately immigration and multiculturalism allow us to reflect more critically on our own culture. If there are harmful things about our culture, for instance, certain american racial views, than people coming in from other countries offer us different perspectives so that we can actually understand things that need to change about our culture. But moreover, we also tell you that we can fight against nationalism in a second way by supporting international institutions and international cooperation. International cooperation is ultimately in everyone's interest because some issues like climate change cannot be solved on a national scale. For instance, by withdrawing from the recent paris climate agreement's donald trump is using nationalism to screw over the entire world. Countries have to work together to stop climate change because carbon doesn't stop at the border and present its passport. At the point where we can only deal with these problems through international institutions, we think that we can create a better world by subsuming nationalism with a sense of internationalism. The europeans are way ahead of the americans on this. The willingness of the european union to do things like provide low interest loans to poorer countries and development to members who suffered under communism shows that they can make everyone's life better while also helping out those who are worse off. Ultimately the EU has created a huge amount of wealth in europe despite what nay sayers tell you by subsuming a sense of nationalism with a sense of europeanism. So with these ideas in mind, we should fight nationalism through promoting multi-culturalism and supporting international institutions. Thank you.
We should subsidize stem cell research. So in this debate we're basically talking about harvesting stem cells from un-implanted human embryos so that we can use those stem cells to research treatments for diseases and the like. So just so everyone is clear on the facts in this debate, the embryos that we harvest these stem cells from have not yet implanted, they're probably four to five days old, and consist of about a hundred cells. So they're a little ball of cells and you pluck out the inside in order to access the stem cells that you need to do your research. Right now the US government doesn't fund this. Other governments around the world like south korea have been more positive towards it. We think that countries like the US should allow stem cell research and also subsidize it. Two arguments: the first is about the reasons why we think this would be beneficial for people with medical issues. But first I want to provide an ethical framework for why we think this is acceptable. The other team, I expect, is going to tell you that it is unethical to harvest stem cells from an embryo that will later grow into a person. What we would tell you though is that while there are clearly shades of gray about when a person becomes a person, you know does it happen in the first trimester? Or the second trimester? Is a fetus a person? There's no world of which you can claim that these embryos deserve the same human rights as you or I. These embryos consist of a little ball of a hundred cells more like I don't know, some tiny sea creature or sponge, than they are like a primate. We think that they lack the ability to feel pain or indeed to feel anything because they have no nervous system. Such a being cannot have the same types of rights as you and I. On the other hand, we have real individuals who are suffering from diseases that likely could be cured or at the very least made less severe using stem cell research. People who do have rights. We think we need to defer to those individuals rather than to defer to the possibility that an embryo may later develop into a being with rights. So with that in mind, let's talk about curing these illnesses. Stem cell research is a new frontier in treating certain diseases that are incurable right now. We think that it's quite likely that many forms of cancer and other illnesses could be treated and that a tremendous amount of human suffering could be alleviated through the use of stem cell research. Of course it's impossible to know that this will happen but at the very least by conducting this research we will likely gain a better understanding of how to help people versus what we have right now. And something I'd like to point out is that harvesting stem cells from embryos is likely a temporary situation. If we allow this research, it's likely that in the future we will gain the understanding to create stem cells through cloning or other processes without destroying human embryos. So this is a temporary harm for a permanent good in terms of our medical knowledge. We'll take that deal every time. Our second argument is that even if you think stem cell research is bad in some ways, you should prefer that it happens in the US or EU countries versus happening in places like thailand where there is less regulation. Why? Obviously stem cell research poses some risk to the person from whom the embryo was removed, namely the mother of this embryo. We think that if you care about protecting people's rights that you should want research go on in countries with the highest standards for ethics. In other words, if there are developing countries where this research will be done when it's not permitted in the united states, and those countries have lower standards for the treatment of people in medical studies, then you should want the studies to be legal in america or britain so that the people participating are treated with more respect and given their human dignity in a way that they might not be in other places. So for these two reasons we should subsidize stem cell research. Thank you.
We should ban abortions. So I want to be very clear what this debate is about. When we say ban we mean when there is no medical reason for the abortion, we wouldn't allow it to be performed. So a medical reason might be the mother's physical or mental health. Obviously if it's a threat to the mother then we would be okay with the abortion, or if the fetus is damaged damaged in some way such that it would be unable to lead a successful life. So for instance, if there's some trouble in the development of the fetus such that it's going to be dead at birth, we're okay with aborting it and removing it, and terminating the pregnancy then. And on top of that, I'd like to point out that we're still completely okay with things like plan b, all forms of birth control, and other types of contraception and efforts to educate people about sexual health. So with that in mind, I think there are two big arguments in this debate. The first and most important it's all obviously that abortion is fundamentally unethical. So the first thing under this is that there's a rights comparison to be made. Obviously there are some trade offs when we talk about abortion between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus. We think that this trade off is a bodily autonomy versus life. So if you prevent someone from having access to an abortion, you do violate their right to bodily autonomy by taking away their ability to make decisions about their own personal health. But we're okay with doing this because principally we think that the right to life of the fetus outweighs the right to bodily autonomy of the mother. This is true for a couple of reasons: one, we tell you that the law generally regards the right to life as the most important right. We see that murder is the most serious crime, and that in general, companies are punished the most harmfully for policies that would damage people's lives, and individuals are held to extremely high standards when it surrounds the lives of others. Even accidentally terminating the life of another person is still a crime, manslaughter, so we don't see why it should be different in this case when the law otherwise takes a very dim view of the sort of thing. But on top of that, we think that the right to life is more important than the right to bodily autonomy because it's facilitative to all other rights. If you aren't alive you can't access any of your rights, and we think that the sum total of every other right is greater than the weight of bodily autonomy. So for these reasons we think that could be the fetus wins out in this rates comparison on top of that we tell you that all human beings are of equal moral worth. It seems extremely difficult to say that any one person is more deserving of rights or the protection of the law than any other person. We also tell you that there's no clear line for personhood during the process of gestation. You can't say on day eighty two of the pregnancy suddenly the fetus becomes a person, but before that it's basically just a vegetable. It seems clear that, you know, the zygote, the most initial cluster of cells that's basically a little ball is not a person, and it seems obvious that a fetus one moment before birth is a person, or even throughout most of the third trimester, when it can survive outside the womb after premature birth, that that is a person. So we think that we need to be conservative here, and in order to avoid killing any people, we need to assume that the fetus is always a person because we don't know when the transition occurs for these reasons it seems clear that abortion is deeply unethical because it requires the risk of killing a human being, because we can't say for certain when this change happens, because it prioritizes a lesser right over a greater right, and because it denies the moral worth of a human being. Our second argument is about state duties. We think that governments have an equal obligation to all citizens and people residing in their country we tell you therefore that the fetus ought be no less deserving of the protections of the state then the mother. I think that the other side might get up here and say that the state owes the mother the right to bodily autonomy or owes the mother the right to healthcare but we think that in the same way it is a strong duty to protect the fetus this is especially strong given that the government so often acts on behalf of children much more strictly than it would on behalf of adults. We think that that should be even more the case for the fetus because it is even less able to help itself then a child that is born would be. So for these reasons, because of the rights trade-off we told you about, and because of the obligations of the state, we should ban abortions when there is no medical necessity. Thank you.
We should subsidize investigative journalism. So just to give a little bit of a model, we think that this subsidy should be based simply on past history. We think we would give it out to people that have done good investigative work in the past, investigative work that's been acclaimed by other journalists in the field rather than just politicians, and we wouldn't stimulate the the type of subsidy that's that's being given out. It wouldn't be based on doing x number of reports, or or investigating x topic, it would be just a blank statement and a check that we give to these businesses in these investigative units based on past success. Alright, two reasons why investigative journalism is so important and why we need more of it in our society today. The first is because it provides an incredibly important and unique check on politicians, and the second is because our modern circumstances in a day and age of social media and fake news, we need fact finding investigation now more than ever. Okay, so on politicians: it it's just simply the case that politicians and political leaders have an immense amount of power and ultimately a large amount of discretion as to how they're going to use that power. Yes it's the case that politicians are checked by voters and politicians are able to be removed from office, but in most cases unless things that are incredibly illegal are done people are able to maintain their power for long stretches of time. Well, checks in the government obviously exist even outside of voting. There's checks between the branches of government and checks as far as regulations, we would say that the press serves as a means of shedding light from the outside in an unskewed manner. And we think there are certain things that the press can uncover that oftentimes are not checked for by the government or by the bureaucracy. So what are these types of things? First they're able to break scandals. There are certain instances in which political leaders are doing things like money laundering money laundering, accepting bribes, committing fraud, all of these types of things that happen and goes goes by the wayside, their colleagues don't notice it. And these are things that steal money from taxpayers and ensure that a representative is doing their job any counterproductive manner. Investigative journalism can also do a deep dive into bureaucracy, covering issues that otherwise are unknown to the public. Take john oliver for example, and how he is able to put together an investigation that's based on the work of other investigative journalists around the country, who are able to uncover things like civil asset forfeiture and do a deep dive into how the government works and how policies behave, and how those policies do serious damage to real life people. And finally they can they can uncover covert operations that may be breaking international law. Again, the investigation that goes around things like the snowden leaks. Things that enhance leaks that are coming out, and otherwise couldn't happen without hardcore investigative journalism. All of these things, we would say, are are bad things that the government does with little other check aside from the press. Given that this is the case, we think that it is incredibly important that the press is funded well and that investigative journalism especially is subsidized. So secondly, why is it so important now? More news outlets than ever exist. Many of them are blogs, online only, and not credible, but they're easy to paint themselves as credible. It's very easy to put on a veneer of legitimacy especially online. We think that subsidizing real deep investigative journalism ensures that there are reliable sources that people can look to to get information about what's going on in the world today and get hard hitting facts about how the world is behaving, how our political leaders are behaving, and they're able to make more informed decisions moving forward. They're able to vote in ways that are more reflective of what they actually desire. They're able to organize and and be active in society in a way that is more informed. They're able to go about their day knowing that someone is checking politicians and knowing that someone is looking out for them, not just for the interests of the elite. For these reasons, we should subsidize investigative journalism.
The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish the american job act. Two many areas of clash, the first on the massive increase of spending, and the impacts we think it has. Recognize, that this jobs act incorporated the expenditure of more than thirty five billion dollars, in efforts to increase either the way that we find jobs, unemployment benefits, and numerous other things, but this money doesn't grow on trees. It comes from somewhere. These stipulations included increases in taxes. The problem with this is that it angers the average citizen, and causes them not to vote for good money spending ventures later. Once we show you that there are more harms to the american jobs act, and the way that it increases jobs, we think it's also easy to recognize that, if you're not spending money in the most efficient manner, you shouldn't waste that money and that political will. There are real issues in this world, that are more important than short term unemployment, that this act cannot solve. We think that issues of homelessness, issues of issues of reproductive rights, all of these things are all more important, than trying to stipulate jobs and unemployment currently. More than this, we think it makes their lives harder. A lot of people simply cannot afford to have more taxes than they currently pay, and it actively interferes with their way of life. Why does it matter, if you increase the jobs of some, if you also make it incredibly difficult for others to live, regardless of the existence of a job? The reasons that I work is in order to put make enough money to support myself, but if that money does not help me to support myself, why would I why would why do I care if I have that job in the first place? More than this though, we think that the other impact of this money is that it cuts other social services, which is actively harmful to lives. We don't know whether this jobs act will work, moreover we have significant reasons to see that it is not, but we know that people need things like welfare, and medicare, and the ability to access free clinics, and we know that this act will cut those. Why would we cut something that we know is functional, in order to pursue a dream? The answer is that we shouldn't. We think that it makes moreover though, we think that it makes people resent the jobs act, and those who are benefited by it. IE those who are for long term unemployed, those receiving unemployment benefits, all of these people, who are already often hated by society and stigmatized, get even more hate on their side of the house. Things like increased attacks, decreases in helpful legislature, all of this is likely to occur when you pass the american jobs act. Our second main area of class has to do with why it's not a good solution. We think the way that this act operates is by creating a dependency of the market on government intervention, and a government like preparedness to create more jobs, by injecting money into like the way that we make jobs. What this means is that these are short term jobs, that go away after the government stops injecting the same amount of money, which they just can't afford to do on a yearly basis, or after sometime. This means that in the long term what you get is a worse recession, that that destroys more jobs in the long term, and creates more distrust in the government, when prices go up, and our resources plummet. We think what happens on their side of the house is that, in the long term, you don't get you don't get solid bipartisan support for a good solution, because you've already wasted all of your efforts on this one. Abolishing the american jobs act now prevents this long term recession, because it forces us to deal with our problems with unemployment, and finding a way to do so now, and not to so in an artificial manner. So, maybe investing in new tech centers, investing in things that will actually create stable jobs, rather than pouring money into trying to extend the jobs that already exist, will be a long term solution. More than this, we think that the jobs act extends unemployment benefits, which could actually increase unemployment in and of itself, because if I'm going to make more money by being unemployed, then I will by working a minimum wage job for forty hours a week, why would I work that minimum wage job? For these reasons, proud to propose.
Time is a human construct, and one we've grown too attached to. We should end daylight savings time. Not because it's not beneficial to be awake during sunlight, or to have sunlight after working hours, for some people. Not even because it's not overall, more beneficial than it is harmful to others, but, because there is a solution that is much more elegant. Let's take a look first who gets harmed by daylight savings time. So, the main problem, that daylight savings time creates, is a, all of the various people who need to work outdoors, now need to have their working day be more in the dark hours, so to speak, right? You have to wake up before sunrise, and therefore you're working during the dark, during the cold, it's less convenient, so to speak. This includes people on boats, this includes farmers, this includes outdoorsmen of any type. Secondly, it hurts trade between companies right? If you're unclear about exactly what time it is, in new york right now for example, and you're not sure if you should subtract seven, or subtract eight, or if we switched the clock and they didn't yet, or we both switched the clock already south back to seven, it makes it more difficult to communicate. We recognize this is probably, not particularly significant, but it is a little annoying, and honestly, nothing in this debate is particularly significant, it's all a little bit annoying. On the plus side, people get sunlight after work, they can enjoy things like shopping and recreational activities, which are potentially somewhat hindered by not having natural daylight when you're done with work, though honestly, quite minimized at the point where regular like human light exists, and is easily used. So what do we see as the more elegant solution? Imagine if, instead of changing the entire country's clocks forward an hour, and seven o'clock now becomes eight o'clock, your employer told you between june and august, you now show up at work at seven instead of at eight? Literally, every single one of the benefits now exists. Instead of the day being an hour earlier, you start your day an hour earlier. Note, if your corporation does a lot of business abroad, that means you are constantly seven hours behind, or whatever about the time it is behind, even though locally, your working hours have shifted. It means breaking out of the idea that, if you wake up at seven today, you have to wake up at seven tomorrow. Because waking up at seven, and waking up at six are the same, because in one case you went to bed at ten, and the other case you went to bed at nine. Yes, that's a lot of time to sleep. If you can recognize that time is a human construct, you can recognize that we are able to play with it on a more individual level. Why is the solution more elegant? A, it means you're not limited to a specific one hour. It means that, if you so please you can break that up into four, and say: come in half an hour earlier here, an hour earlier here, half an hour later there, and an hour later there. B, it means that, wherever it's useful, a corporation or a business can choose to adopt it. To people to whom it's not useful, maybe parents, maybe schools, maybe outdoor workers, they can choose not to adopt it. This means everyone wins, instead of some people wining. For these reasons, we should end daylight saving time and just play with time a little bit more.
We should protect whistleblowers because protection of whistleblowers is absolutely vital to preservation of public good in a lot of situations. So I think that that's for starters a pretty good standard of when someone should be like qualified as a whistleblower rather than just somebody who's like leaking corporate secrets. Because obviously you need to have a line there, you can't just let anyone spill any corporate secrets that's happening but I think that when you're talking about public good or a very clear public interest knows you're circumstances under which you need to make sure that you're protecting whistleblowers because people's livelihoods could be on the line, people's rights could be on the line, people's lives could be on the line, and these are all important circumstances. Because when you're talking about whistleblowers you could be talking about a wide variety of incredibly important actors. You could be talking about people who work in the government who have information about widespread and systematic and intentional rights violation in secret. People like edward snowden who had that information and then had to fear persecution because of that. You can talk about people who let's say know things about like secret government operations maybe like CIA operations that were like contain horrible instances of misconduct. Possibly things like torture, toppling democratic regimes, things that are not exactly unheard of and things that the public should be able to know about so that way actions can be held accountable for. When you're talking about corporations, you could be talking about people who pollute the environment, people who skirt say banking regulations or any kind of regulation, people who do all kinds of messed up things. These are ways these are actors who are only going to be held accountable if the public knows about it because as long as these things keep being held keep being secret, you are not going to see any change to these actions. You're going to keep seeing rivers be polluted by corporations, you're going keep seeing governments violate people's rights or possibly take people's lives and these are things that keep happening unless you can actually gather enough public pressure to put an end to that. So that's why whistleblowing is crucial and that's why you need to protect them because while they're serving a very valuable public service and they're helping society a lot of cases, it can come at great personal cost if you're whistleblowing against the government. The government can put you in prison, they can try you for treason, they can do all kinds of things to you that are absolutely horrible. If it's a corporation they could do the next worst thing which is try to take every dime that you own and make sure you are unemployable forever and that's obviously not really good for you. They're your career and a whole lot of other aspects for you. So it's important to make sure that people are protected so they don't feel like they have to put their own livelihood or lives at risk just to do a really do something for the public good. There are certain things that are more important and I feel like the fact that like governments want to protect their secrets because they don't want people to know about them or corporations want to make sure that like people don't like spill their secrets things like that. That's all fine and good but at the end of the day that shouldn't be a that shouldn't be used as a cover up for immoral actions and when people are acting immorally you need to shine a light on them to make sure that justice can actually happen. So for all those reasons, we should protect whistleblowers.
We should end water fluoridation. So water fluoridation is a process by which fluoride is added to the water so that people will be less likely to get dental cavities. The idea is that by introducing fluoride into people's diet, ultimately their teeth will be healthier and less likely to decay over time. In many countries fluoride is added to the public water at a central plant before it's distributed to people's houses. In this way people don't really have a choice about whether they want fluoride in their water. It's just automatically put there on their behalf. We're not going to argue that fluoride is fundamentally unsafe. We think that it's been well proven in the states and in europe that it is but we're going to make a few arguments for why it shouldn't be put in the tap water. Our first argument is that people don't have any choice about whether or not they get fluoride in their tap water. For most people, the tap is the source of all of their drinking water, at least in countries that are developed enough to offer fluoride. Presumably in countries like turkey where people don't normally drink the water, there's no point in adding fluoride. But with that in mind we tell you that people should have a reasonable expectation to pure drinking water. It may be true that some people want fluoride but other people may not. I'm not saying that this is a well informed choice. Those people are probably ill informed or making a poor decision by choosing not to want fluoride, but we still think that that choice ought belong to those people. At the end of the day we let people make stupid decisions all the time. If people can drink coca cola even though it rots your teeth, we don't see why they should be forced to have chemicals in their water. We think that ultimately people who want fluoride are likely to get it from brushing their teeth, more on that in just a minute, and so people who don't want it should be allowed to make a choice about whether or not they want to consume it. At the end of the day even if we think this is a stupid choice, we shouldn't prevent people from making their own decisions just because we disagree with them. In liberal democracies and other highly developed countries we ought instead defer to letting people make their own decisions even when there's some drawbacks such as a higher risk of cavities. Our second argument is that there isn't much need for water fluoridation anymore nowadays. This used to be much more important back before people brush their teeth as often or with as high a quality of toothpaste. Nowadays if you go and buy toothpaste, your crest or your colgate or whatever is popular in your country from the pharmacist, that toothpaste has fluoride in it. And all of the benefits that you get from water fluoridation are also accessed by brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste. Basically you just need some exposure every day. There's no benefit to drinking a few liters of fluoridated water as opposed to brushing your teeth with fluoridated toothpaste. And since people are already doing that we think that it's superfluous to go ahead and put fluoride in the water. More on that in just a moment. But we think that also in regards to what we said earlier about choice, if people want to choose to use a fluoride free toothpaste, again, that may be a poor decision, but it ultimately ought be their decision. We should let people control what they put into their own bodies. Our third and final argument is that this is a poor use of government funds. So recognize that we've already shown you that people would be getting fluoride already whether or not it's in the water because it's in their toothpaste. At that point the government is spending money every year on something that doesn't actually do any good. So it may be true that this isn't massively expensive. We're not going to tell you that the US is spending billions of dollars on fluoride. It isn't. But all government money is fungible. So we think that this money could be better spent on other public health programs instead. Things like improving water quality more broadly or improving rural access to safe drinking water, for instance, are a trade-off with fluoridation. This money could be spent in those ways and would ultimately benefit people more greatly than what we see as a benefit of water fluoridation. So for all of these reasons we think that we should end water fluoridation. Thank you.
We should end athletic scholarships. So in this debate we're talking about the kinds of scholarships common at many division one schools in the united states where students get a full ride in exchange for playing sports at a very high level at oftentimes large wealthy universities. We're not concerned with partial scholarships offered at smaller schools or were students actually have a choice about playing, we're really talking about those where students are forced to play in order to keep their scholarship. So with that in mind we have two main points: the first is that this is abusive to the students who receive those scholarships. As a bit of context, recognize that many of the students receiving these scholarships come from a low income background where they wouldn't normally have the opportunity to attend these universities. So the other team might tell you it's good that they gain an opportunity, but we think that what's actually happening is that they're being coerced to accept the scholarships whether or not they're a good deal because this is seen as their only ticket out of perhaps a bad neighborhood or a ticket out of poverty. At that point we don't think people are able to freely opt in or out of these scholarships. So with that in mind, recognize that the students are being forced to work for free. Although the other team might say they're being given a free university education, we don't normally let employers pay in kind in the developed world. They can't give you tickets to spend at the factory store anymore in exchange for work. Which is basically what it amounts to if you pay someone for their work by giving them some of your product for free. They don't get any money, they're not allowed to make money off of their likeness and ultimately these universities are making millions of dollars as a result at the expense of these students. And they can't quit. If you stop playing football or basketball at one of these universities, then you lose your scholarship and you're completely out of luck. We'd also like to point out that oftentimes these university athletic systems are used as a free training program by pro sports leagues. The NBA and the NFL in the united states don't run training leagues. Instead they recruit college athletes. So what they do is let colleges train these students and pay for it and make millions of dollars off of them and then the NBA and the NFL get to make millions of dollars off of them without paying for their training. And if they got hurt in college and aren't able to pay pro, well that means that the league saves that much more money and leave those students with none of the money that they would have made playing in pro leagues. We think that's the trade off here, is that without these scholarships the pro sports leagues would have to pay to train these students and ultimately they would actually have some money and have some recourse and some opportunity if they got injured. Our second point is that we think this is bad for the universities that offer the scholarships. We think that primarily it is a poor use of funds. The other team might say that a school like university of california berkeley has plenty of money and this doesn't mean anything to them. But money is fungible. So any money that a school like berkeley spends on athletics instead of on academics or research is money that's not helping other people. This money could have been spent on medical research, or perhaps more likely, it could have been spent on scholarships for needy students. We think that it would be much better to go and recruit athletically talented students from the same areas and same demographics that would normally get athletic scholarships and give the money to them since they're more likely to be able to fulfill the university's primary purpose, namely to provide education to citizens. And lastly we think that you lose out on qualified students. You're using a lot of your resources on a handful of basketball, football, baseball players by having these scholarships. So other students aren't receiving the same resources and might choose to go to other universities. We think a lot of people probably choose other schools over berkeley because they can't get access to facilities or things that they need and ultimately if the school provided for those students rather than spending a lot of money on athletic scholarships then maybe they would attract better students overall. So for these reasons we should end athletic scholarships. Thank you.
The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish capital punishment. We think this is not like mutually exclusive with intensifying other kinds of punishments like we that we're fine with doing things like replacing capital punishment or like replacing the punishment for crimes for which capital punishment would have been used with harsher sentences and things like that what we're not fine is that we just like don't think it's okay to kill another individual in response to a crime. Three main areas of two main areas of clash, first on why it is immoral for a few reasons. First we think that it is incredibly cruel. We think that insofar as like human beings are choosing whether or not to punish other people like there is no overall authority that is able to define whether or not someone deserves that which is coming down on them we use certain kinds of standards to make sure that our internal biases and like our other kinds of natures or our vengelfulness doesn't come against just like basic human rights and respecting individual life and we think that one of the standards that we use is the standard of cruel and unusual punishment which we see legally recognized in multiple states but we also just think is a good principle to follow insofar as we buy that individuals probably are intrinsically equal and even if you do something that is very very bad you probably don't deserve to be treated with intense cruelty insofar as punishment can be given to you in other kinds of ways and we think that insofar as death is the ultimate end to anything that you can accomplish in the future we think it is the ultimate form of cruelty that it deprives the individual of everything that any other person will be able to experience in the rest of their life. Insofar as it doesn't meet that basic standard we don't think that it is something that ought be performed but also under think under this we knew that it is an incredibly racist policy and an arbitrary one in that we know that people have certain biases that tell them that certain races of individuals are more dangerous or more likely to have committed crimes than other ones so we see this with how we see that the capital punishment is instituted infinitely more often for black men than for white men even when they commit the same exact crimes and insofar as this racist enforcement occurs we don't think that's a moral action or something that is morally justifiable. But also we think that the arbitrariness of it is also dangerous in that insofar as whether or not I end up with the death penalty or just a couple of life sentences in prison can be defined by whether or not the judge had lunch before. We don't understand how something so arbitrary and so non generalizable can ever be moral. But finally we think the real center here is just that it has the massive potential for harming the innocent. Insofar as the guilty can get punished even without capital punishment but on the other hand innocent get the ultimate rights violation we think that it is never justified to commit capital punishment on the off chance risk that you are going to kill someone who is who is actually innocent because of all the damage that they will suffer so and we think that ultimately is what really makes it immoral and can never ever be justified because we think that these kinds of purposes of punishment happen to make sure that someone doesn't commit a crime again or to make sure they're no longer dangerous for society things like that but we don't think any of that comes into play when you are hurting those that you are supposed to be protecting in the first place. But our second area of clash is just about why it's unpragmatic. First recognize that the death penalty is actually more expensive than just housing someone in a jail first because you never have the opportunity for parole so whereas costs can be cut down significantly when individuals are let off on good behavior and things like that with jail time this never happens with the death penalty but also because it has so many bureaucratic holes that you have to jump through in terms of liability and in terms of the drugs that you have to pay for and things like that and all the people you have to pay along the way it's actually statistically a lot more expensive to kill someone as punishment than it is to keep that person in jail and insofar as we think that any money that comes out of like the taxpayer's pocket is probably a loss to the taxpayer when it's not used to benefit them and this is just a punishment for someone else we think that that's something that is incredibly unpragmatic and ought not happen. Proud to propose.
We should end mandatory retirement. So, right now, in many countries, such as germany, people have to retire when they reach a certain age, like sixty-five. We think that people should be able to continue to work as long as they do a satisfactory job and meet their employers' expectations, which is already the status quo in some other countries, like the united states. So, with this in mind, we have three points for our side. First, we think that mandatory retirement is discriminatory against the elderly. We think that presumably these are people who want to continue working for whatever reason, at the point where they're being forced to retire. People who want to retire are outside the scope of this debate, because they'll continue to do so either way. We think that there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to work, given that you wish to do so. Just because of your age, it seems arbitrary as a standard. If you're forty-five or sixty-five, either way you might have bills to pay that you need to work to fulfill, or you might enjoy your job or find it personally fulfilling and want to continue it. We think that you shouldn't discriminate against people who are sixty-five while you let those four forty-five do what they want. We think that ultimately, the state needs to treat people fairly regardless of intrinsic characteristics, that is to say, things that are beyond people's control. In the same way that we don't think that latino people and white people should have different standards for one when they're allowed to work, neither should people of different age groups. Our second argument is that we think that mandatory retirement actually harms the work force and institutions. So realize that, presumably, these are people who aren't being asked to retire in the status quo. Because imagine right now that we have, I don't know, a manager in an office who isn't doing a satisfactory job because of their age, that person could be asked to retire or resign in the status quo because they aren't doing their job well. So the only people that this debate is about is people who are still performing their job in a satisfactory way, and we can imagine many careers where people could work well into their seventies and still do a good job, such as university professors. So at this point, we tell you that these institutions are losing out on workers who are doing such a good job that the company wants to keep them on. We think that, ultimately, individual companies or universities or other employers better know who ought to be hired and who ought to be fired than the government. As long as we protect against discrimination among employers, we think that ultimately they should have the final say on who they employ. Because some government bureaucrat, who looks at the numbers on a piece of paper about a person, can't see if they contribute lots of unique experience or values or leadership in the office that might be lost if that person were forced to retire. We think that ultimately, it's likely that you access things like leadership uniquely when you keep older people around because they have seen more problems arise and better know how to cope with them, and also because of the respect that they command within the workplace. Our third and final argument, which I hinted at earlier, is that there's no fair standard for mandatory retirement. Some countries, like germany, have one age for basically everyone, but this seems unfair because different jobs have different requirements. It probably is true that you can't be a stone mason into your seventies because physical fitness would prevent you from doing so. But why can't you be a university professor or a newspaper reporter, when those jobs are things that primarily rely on your thinking ability rather than your ability to do physical labor. We tell you, ultimately, that you could make different standards for different types of employment, but then that discriminates against people in certain career paths. We think that in order to win the debate, the other team needs to explain to you what a fair, clear standard is. We tell you that if it's different ages for different careers that that's arbitrary, and so is one age for every career. So we don't think that they'll be able to meet this burden. For these reasons, I am proud to suggest that we should end mandatory retirement. Thank you.
Boarding schools are advantageous. So by boarding schools, quite simply we mean schools where children, we're talking about primary and secondary school here, live away from their families, at the school. So think of something like hogwarts, if you want. And by advantageous we mean that we think that these are better for their pupils than a traditional school where the pupils live at home during their education. So three arguments. The first is that we think students will learn more at boarding schools than other types of schools. Recognize that there is much more to education than just math, reading and writing. We think that physical education and social education is as important to producing young citizens as traditional academic education is. But we do all of these things better. It's easier to have students spending more time in class and to guarantee that they're doing their homework and their reading if they're at school. You can have study halls which are monitored by older students or by teachers, and ultimately ensure that students are getting tutoring they need and that they're doing all the work. You can also have programs like sports that every student can participate in, or educational clubs that every student can participate in, whereas at a normal school some students would have too long to travel going home to be able to take advantage of these opportunities. Now, everyone would, and we think it's more likely that they would all have well rounded educations if you were able to have this type of education at a boarding school. If students learn more, then they become more successful citizens, they're able to work and be more effective, and ultimately, we think that it will be to their good in the long run, even if it's difficult for them at times in the short run. Our second point is point is about reducing inequality. So some students at a traditional school are going to be able to pay to join sports teams and clubs, are going to have parents who are very well read and who can teach them at home, are going to have tutors and nannies and things like that, and other students are going to go home to an empty house and wait for their parents to come home so they can just have something to eat. We think that at a boarding school you reduce this type of inequality because all students have access to the kind of human capital that wealthy students would have access to normally. So they can be around tutors, they can be around religious officials, they can be around people who can help them with problems that they face. We can also guarantee that students are getting a nutritious, healthy diet, that they have a safe place to sleep, that they're you, know not, being bullied by the other students. I think that the other side might try to tell you bullying is worse in boarding schools, but we tell you that it's much easier to identify when you have students on the premises, and easier to do something about it. If you're a working parent you don't have a lot of time to invest in helping a child who's being bullied, and we think that we can take care of it better in a boarding environment. So ultimately, we think that students from a lower income background are going to benefit especially so that boarding schools are advantageous for that reason. Our last point is about preparation for life. So recognize that schools are not an end into themselves who want to produce young citizens, who want to produce workers, etcetera, by using schools. So how do we do that? As I mentioned earlier, there's more education than just reading, writing, and math, although those things are certainly important. But most people don't end up living in the same town that they grew up in. Most people don't live in their parents house, after they graduate from high school they have to move somewhere else to get a job. In the real world, so to speak, we don't often get the luxury of spending all of our time with our family or of being sheltered from the realities of the world. Boarding school is a kind of gentle introduction to what that's like, because in boarding school you know you can have a gentler learning curve than you would otherwise. Many people go out into the real world from regular schools and they don't know how to live on their own, they don't want to take care of themselves, they've never been away for the family, so they're at a great disadvantage. But students who have grown up at boarding school are more likely to be independent, more likely to know how to look after themselves, more likely to know how to make friends in a new place, and these are skills that you can't get anywhere else, that are very important for success as an adult. So for these three reasons, we think boarding schools are advantageous. Thank you.
We should cancel pride parades. So, pride parades are parades held by the gay community in some cities around the world to celebrate the community and certain rights that have been achieved or to advocate for greater expansion of rights to the gay community. We think that cities should stop issuing permits for these parades to occur. We have a few reasons why we think this would be preferable to the status quo. First, we think that pride parades create a problematic narrative about what it means for a person to be part of the LGBTQ community. Ultimately, pride parades promote a certain idea of what it means to be LGBTQ that doesn't include many of the people who should be included in that umbrella. In particular, we think that these parades tend to be dominated by gays and lesbians at the expense of transexual and bi people, who may face even greater discrimination but aren't included in the public perception of what pride is about. But secondly, they're also very prescriptive about what it means for someone to be gay or lesbian. The idea of the stereotypically flamboyant gay person who's very out and very proud and very loud about their sexual preferences doesn't really apply to everyone. We think that people who are either from those more marginalized LGBTQ backgrounds are less likely to feel included, but also that people who are black, who are religious, who are from immigrant communities that are less accepting of this kind of flamboyance are systematically excluded from traditional pride parades. They're really just a celebration of the most privileged people within the LGBTQ community, namely, white men and women, generally from an upper-class background, who live in a community that's accepting of this. There's a reason that these parades tend to take place in cities like boston or san francisco and not in poorer or more rural areas where people are less accepting, even though there are just as many gay people in those communities. We think that ultimately there are many harms to this exclusive narrative. First of all, it gives people a false perception of what it means for someone to be LGBTQ, and they think: oh, those people don't belong in my community, or don't exist in my community, which makes it harder for closeted people, especially youth living in those communities, to come out and be open about their identity, because they're always being given this prescriptive narrative that doesn't include them and their experience. It also hides the existence of transgender or bisexual people, who generally are not included in this narrative about what it means to be gay according to pride parades and the images that they create. So things like bi erasure are actually made worse by the existence of these pride parades, many of which are put on by organizations that are explicitly exclusive of bi people. And what's more, this also glosses over some of the darkest parts of discrimination against LGBTQ people. When was the last time you saw anyone talk about homeless trans youths at a pride parade? We think that, ultimately, for this to be the big event that draws attention to this community, it does a really poor job at conveying what that community actually needs because it's so focused on people of privilege. So we think that this narrative is very harmful and therefore that these parades ought be ended. But the second thing we'd like to talk about is the backlash that they generate. We think that many instances of violence or discrimination against the LGBTQ community are actually driven by these parades and by the narrative that they create. When people think that gay people are very flamboyant and different from themselves, it's harder for them to empathize. So we think that this actually increases the size of the empathy gap between some people in the gay community and leads to more backlash and more violence against people. So we think that's also a good reason to end these parades, because they don't really represent the community, and they undermine empathy and understanding. For all these reasons, we should cancel pride parades. Thank you.
We recognize that to many people their jobs and work is a fundamental part of their lives which shapes in large part a man's identity. That is exactly why the manner in which a person retires is of huge importance. We are here to tell you that having a mandatory age of retirement allows people to retire with dignity. Opposition might come and speak about the humiliation of forcing a man to quit due to his age and about how much of a discrimination it is. Well we agree. And that is exactly what we think it's critical to have a mandatory retirement age. Having a set age where both the worker and the employer know that this employee is going to retire allows for a certain framework that everyone can set their mind to. Let's think of the moment where the employer understands that it will be more profitable for him to replace the seasoned employee with a new one. The question of when this moment occurs is obviously like varies from person to person, but in today's world where computers and technology have conquered much of the of the work and job market and made it very difficult for older generations we say that this age usually happens before the age of retirement and that it's not likely to change in the upcoming generations. So if the employer already knows that this employee only has two or three years left and then he's going to retire anyways it's more likely that they will that they would rather allow him to reach that retirement age whether like, be it out of respect for the employee or because of considerations of of like, cost benefits because even the the small amount of money that they could save us from replacing that employee aren't worth the bad reputation of a boss that throws his employee to the streets two years before retirement age, and the effect that it's going to have on the rest of the of this guy's employees and on their motivation. But in the absence of such a set age what's likely to happen is that employers will take care of replacing that employee as soon as he starts becoming a liability. As long as retirement is being forced upon you because of a law then it's not that much of a humiliation because it is like you could always say that well it's a random law that is supposed to only catch the average of people so it doesn't mean anything and it doesn't say anything to me personally into my personal abilities. But as soon as the retirement is being forced on you because you were fired then you have no other way of explain it explaining this to yourself other then that you are no longer valuable and that's where the humiliation and the feeling of, like, lack of self of self worth kicks in. So pay attention that even in in the best case that opposition might talk to you about if there was no mandatory retirement age people might have a few more years if they are people that that like really age marvelously so they could could keep their job their jobs for a few extra years. But eventually they will reach the age where they are being replaced with someone younger that's just how the world works. So opposition in its best case can only postpone the situation a few years but not avoid it. So in order to prevent many people from reaching a situation where where they will have to face losing their jobs in an unexpected manner with old age and all the psychological difficulties that come with it we are proud to propose.
We should abolish bit coins. So we think that a group of countries the world's largest economies like that the US european union countries and china should come together to crackdown on bitcoin and prevent it from being purchased sold or used within their countries. We have a few arguments for our side. The first is that bit coin is largely used for black market purchases. Now I know that in recent years bit coin advocates have started talking about how legitimate businesses are accepting bitcoin and you can even use it to buy a cup of coffee in some cities but really bit coin exists to buy things that are illegal. The reason why people go through such great lengths in order to buy a bit coin is so that they can purchase something without being tracked by the government. If you went and bought a huge amount of drugs for instance with US dollars the government could track the serial numbers of those dollar bills and if you were stupid enough to pay with a credit card that will be very easy to track. But with a bit coin you can buy lots of drugs or pay for illegal services like prostitution where that's illegal and you would be able to get away with it because no one could track the payment method. It would be completely anonymous and out of the government's control. So when people do things like order drugs over the internet they want to pay with bit coins. So we think that because this is pretty clearly a way to avoid law enforcement and make it easier to consume illegal drugs or pay for illegal services that bit coin should be abolished because it's a threat to the rule of law. Ultimately even if bit coin isn't doing anything wrong in and enough itself the fact that it exists to facilitate illegal behavior is still sufficient to ban it. We see that this is true in other ways as well you can't own the tools to break into a car certain locksmith tools in a lot of cities even though the locksmith tools don't do anything wrong in and of themselves because they really only would be purchased for nefarious purposes. Bit coin is the same way and by the same principle we ought stop people from being able to buy and use it. And while some people might intend to use their bit coins for legitimate purposes ultimately we think that those people should know that what they're doing is making it easier to commit crimes and that they're not completely innocent in and of themselves. Our second argument is about tax avoidance in the same way that we can't track purchases with bitcoin we also can't track bit coin for tax purposes. So if you have a business that is billing people in bitcoin they could very easily avoid paying the tax that they owe to the state because ultimately the IRS would have a hard time proving that they had a certain amount of money in their accounts. At the same time people who pay with bitcoin don't have to ultimately commit to paying sales tax or other taxes that they ought to when they spend that money. But this even goes beyond that. Many people might transfer money between countries using bitcoin in order to avoid paying tax in a country that has relatively high tax rates. So it also becomes a way to funnel money out of the country illegally. So in the same way that it facilitates illegal transactions it also facilitates tax avoidance. We think that in the same way that we could step in for illegal transactions we can also ban bit coin if it's being used as a way for people to avoid paying their taxes. After all we would be very suspicious of people who were trying to take thousands of dollars in cash out of their country. We ought be equally suspicious if people are trying to take thousands of dollars of bit coins out of the country. So ultimately this doesn't work any differently than smuggling cash or gold or other valuables the same kind of thing that you might have to declare when you enter the european union or the united states but people are able to get away with it because it's untrackable. So ultimately because in these two ways bi coin poses a threat to the rule of law we ought abolish bit coin. Thank you.
We should subsidize embryonic stem cell research. Three arguments in this speech: first on whether it's moral to be experimenting on embryonic cells, second point about a black market and a third point about why is this subsidy so crucially needed and what is the state's role in this. So first point, is it moral to be experimenting on embryonic cells? So a lot of the opposers to this research oppose it for similar reasons as they would oppose abortions. To them the embryos are living creatures that deserve protection. But here is the fact that is crucial in this regard: unlike abortions, the alternative to these specific embryos that are used in this research isn't a normal pregnancy or normal life, this research uses embryos in the very early stages of development that were left over from in-vitro fertilization. The alternative for these embryos is to just be thrown away, or frozen indefinitely somewhere. And so if you are a pro choicer you would probably see no real in in, no real injustice here anyway. But even if like even for pro lifers, I believe that this fact would change many people's opinion. Because no active quote unquote killing takes place here. The embryo isn't worse off this way. This is a net good. Secondly, black market. So naturally we don't really mean a black market literally here. Very doubtful that there are going to make experiments on embryonic stem cells in a dark back alley somewhere. What we do mean to say is that as soon as the government will be the main like actor that funds this research, then it can supervise and regulate and so as to make sure that indeed no foul play is being made here. No woman is being pushed to terminate a natural pregnancy solely for the purpose of conducting research. Once there is no public subsidy then private charities enter the picture, and they already have like one clear agenda here, which is to investigate and research as many embryonic stem cells as possible, and unlike the government they don't care as much about the embryos in any way. And I don't think that's necessarily bad but this does mean that paradoxically, whoever is worried about like not conducting abortions for sake of this research, should support public funding for it more than more than anyone else. So lastly, why is this subsidy needed, and why is it the the job of the government? Well, firstly because embryonic stem cell research is considered one of the fields with the highest potential to promote our knowledge in in everything that has to do with finding medicine and cures for pressing matters like cancer or or alzheimer's and other very serious diseases. And this is obviously something that is very much a public interest. It's just like research that goes into climate change, which we obviously fund and give subsidies to all the time. And the second reason is that it's it will be incredibly hard to raise enough money for this research to be successful without help from the government, simply because this is considered it's considered such a controversial issue, and many donors would prefer to invest their money in like universal purposes that will grant them like everybody's favor. Like, I don't know, supporting orphans or saving extinct panda bears or something. So we really need the government to step in in this case. For all of these reasons please propose.
We should abandon television. Television is one of the most popular forms of media globally. However we think that it has served its purpose and that it would be better if we shifted to watching programs and movies over streaming services online as opposed to cable or satellite or over the air waves television. Three arguments for why we think this is the case. First, we think that consumers would have more choice if we switch to streaming and away from legacy television. Right now if you want to watch TV you have you know at best two hundred channels to choose from. Whereas with streaming you have access to every program, every movie ever made. We think that although television offers more choice now than it once did, it will never be able to compete with streaming in terms of the total amount of choice offered. We think this is a good reason to switch to streaming because it means that consumers will get to see more of the programs that they want and also that media will be more accessible. People who have certain cultures or backgrounds that lead them to prefer one type of media but who are a minority, such that those programs wouldn't often be on TV, will now have better access to that media. So we think that a switch to streaming would be preferable to continued use of legacy television. Our second argument is about the accessibility of niche programming. So remember what I just said about how this helps minority groups. But we also tell you that things like educational programming would be cheaper to produce because more people would be able to see them if they went up on streaming, and more accessible to children because they would be available all the time, not merely when they're on TV, and that this would maximize the return on investment for things like educational or cultural television programming. We also think that more different groups would have access to creating content. Right now imagine you're a native american who wants to produce a TV program about your culture. You would have to convince a channel that this would get enough viewers to actually be worth it for them to invest in. But with online streaming you only need to convince a handful of investors that it's worth putting this online because streaming is not zero sum. Whereas with TV, only one program can be shown on a network at a given time. With streaming you could have everybody in the world watching a different stream. This means that people from disadvantaged backgrounds won't have to compete in a zero sum environment with more numerous or privileged groups in order to get their media produced and their voices heard. So we think that more people have access to producing programming in a world where we move away from legacy television. Our third argument is that we think that streaming would be less expensive for everyone. Right now one of the driving costs of cable in america and other countries is that certain networks like ESPN are very expensive and other networks don't cost a lot of money. So cable providers bundle ESPN with less expensive networks so that the cost is spread out to everyone, even people who don't watch a lot of sports. And this isn't just ESPN, that's one example. But what we tell you is that with streaming people can choose to, say pay per view, to watch sporting events that they want to see. We see this a little bit right now with cable when you have things like boxing matches as pay per view. But we think that ultimately that model is more likely to take off for all sports with streaming and that this would protect people who don't want to consume certain types of media from having to subsidize it for others. But what's more, there are also huge overhead costs to maintaining legacy television infrastructure. You need receivers, you need emitters, you need the rights to certain parts of the air waves, so ultimately we think that there are many barriers to access and many high costs to producing legacy television that don't exist for streaming. So for these reasons we should abandon television and switch to online streaming. Thank you.
We should prohibit international adoption. So what we're talking about in this debate is largely going to be people in wealthy countries like britain or america adopting children from less wealthy countries like sudan or china. We think that this should be prohibited by the governments of the less wealthy countries where these children would be adopted from. We're agnostic about the laws in the more wealthy country where the parents would be located. Three arguments for our side this evening. First, international adoption is a major cause of the loss of human capital. Recognize that the children who are being adopted to other countries would otherwise have stayed and worked in their home country. So if your say sudan and you have thousands of children being adopted by europeans and americans, those are children who later don't go on to work in your economy. So we think that international adoption ultimately means that you lose out on workers, on students, on people who could contribute to your society. Therefore it's in your best interest to prohibit this practice so that those people remain and contribute to the growth of your own country. This is particularly true when you have children being adopted who are part of a minority ethnic group. For instance if you had one tribe that disproportionately had children being adopted by americans or europeans we think it's likely that that group would face undue harm from this adoption process because they would lose out on even more human capital relative to the rest of the population. So we think that there's a compelling interest to prevent these children from being adopted abroad so that they remain and work for their community and their country which ultimately will make everyone in the country better off due to the capital that they provide through their labor. Our second argument is that we think this commodifies and fetishizes the adopted children. What we mean by this is that a huge business is going to rise up around international adoption. We see this is already the case between countries like russia and america. There are a lot of businesses which exist to help americans adopt russian babies. What this means is that the children aren't being treated as individuals by the adoption agency. They're a source of money and all of the children are kind of lumped in as interchangeable as long as it ultimately makes the adoption agency money. Since the parents most often never meet the children before they travel or before the children are sent to america or to europe, that means that they are dehumanized and not treated as individuals. Matches are made between children and parents without any consideration of the individual needs of these children because the companies are basically profit seeking and just see them as a source of money. At that point we think that the adoptions that are made are going to be poor matches and that many of these children will end up being sent back to their home country and feeling abandoned or put into homes that are not loving and supportive. It would have been better in that case to keep them in their home country we think where the very least the community is more likely to be supportive. Our third argument is about the harms that international adoption does to domestic children. And I guess here we're thinking about the considerations you would have to take in the wealthier country and why we think it's wrong to have these international adoptions. Recognize that the main driver of international adoptions is not that there's a shortage of orphans or foster children in america or in europe, it's that people only want to adopt small babies. They don't want to adopt older children because there are stereotypes that those children have behavioral issues or because they want to mold these babies in their own image. What that means is that because there is a huge pool of babies internationally, older children in these countries don't get adopted who otherwise would have if there were no babies available. Because people would still adopt, they would just have to adopt older children at that point. So we think that this is grossly unfair to those children who then lose out on the ability to have a family, to be adopted and to live a better life. So for these reasons we should prohibit international adoption. Thank you.
We should end mandatory retirement. Mandatory retirement is an archaic and unacceptable use of government power and private power against individuals who have not consented to the harms against them. When individuals age it typically means they're less efficient. However, it is unacceptable to force them out of positions that they need to put food on the table and shelter over their heads. Furthermore, much of our mandatory retirement laws and requirements are based of a misconception and an archaic understanding of how aging works. Because we believe that individuals, particularly those outside of the manufacturing sector, are actually able to work far above current mandatory retirement ages we believe we should end it out right. My first argument is how mandatory retirement is unjust and my second argument is how mandatory retirement is inefficient. So first off on how is unjust. We believe that mandatory retirement is fundamentally arbitrary. Individuals did not consent to their age. Furthermore, age is not necessarily a reflection of their own skill or capacity in a private sense or in an efficiency sense either. We believe that this kind of discrimination is at face inherently based on prejudice against individuals who are older. Although this is not quite as pernicious as sex, race or class based discrimination, discrimination in any form must be fought wherever it is found. We believe government has the obligation then to step in. Why is this the case? First because government guarantees individuals rights before the law. It further guarantees individuals equal rights. That is to say no matter what your circumstances you ought be necessarily protected against undue abuses. Secondly though we think government has the obligation to step in because it is the only individual the only organization which can check against the power of large private corporations. Regardless of what private citizens do, private corporations will do whatever improve their bottom line, or whatever they think improves their bottom line, even it's if it's based on misconceptions. We believe that government must then step in to actually stop them from abusing their own employees and those who would otherwise work for that company. Keep in mind that we are fully accepting of policies which ends, which requires retirement or otherwise ends employment if a employee is unable to fulfill the capacity within their jobs. That is to say if I can no longer work my job and it is because of my age I should not be employed. However, forcing someone to retire simply because of their age, even if they can continue to work, is fundamentally unjust. My second argument is regarding efficiency. Why do we think mandatory retirement is inefficient? It is largely based on laws that are far far outdated. In the past we were unable to effectively measure the metrics in which individuals created and utilized their own time and work. In the status quo we have computers, we have technology which allow us to record the total productivity of employees. This means that rather than having a blanket policy in which we fire people across the board, we can continue to allow them to work into old age until they are no longer efficient. This inherently means that older employees, who have trained in skills that other individuals are not used to, who have more far more experience than much of the co workers, and who can otherwise contribute to their work space, can continue to work. We would further say that ending mandatory retirement is efficient because many individuals at old age need to work longer than they actually have before mandatory retirement. Unfortunately most americans do not have enough money to retire. This is because they are forced to spend money on repeating goods, they're forced to spend money on insurance, which necessarily means they don't have enough money to save. Allowing them to continue to work means that we spend less on welfare for homeless elderly and spend less on non government organizations which would attempt to feed them. As such we should and mandatory retirement.
This house would ban telemarketing. What we mean by this is that campaigns that use the telephone and cold calling people to sell their products would no longer be allowed. You could obviously still have areas in which an individual has to call a certain number to make a purchase but you would not be able to specifically market using the telephone like product as we currently have in the status quo. Three main areas of clash, first on why this is just generally a really problematic way of attempting to sell things. I think what we have to recognize is that telemarketing relies on this idea that there are individuals who are going to be either tired enough or uninformed enough or don't have enough time to do their research to make a purchase at the moment that someone is calling their door. We think that it's actually really really coercive in that it basically tells people like look we're catching you in this situation in which maybe you're less comfortable maybe you're in the middle of a like a private matter or in the middle of your everyday life and we're going to use the opportunity to try and sell you something and we think that like even if this isn't something that is intrinsically bad insofar as there are many many or like legally bad insofar as there are many many ways for individuals to sell products in other ways especially with the invention of things like the internet we don't understand why it is necessary to have something like telemarketing which tries to playoff of individuals' weaknesses. We especially think that it gets worse when we recognize it compounds with preexisting things such as targeted advertisement we think that given that individuals are going to be bombarded with imagery of things they probably don't need but might have mentioned that they want either way we think it's problematic that they can also be targeted over the phone. Our second area of clash is just that it's annoying. We think that insofar as governments exist to protect the average citizen and we think that these protections can come in many forms not just in terms of security we don't think that there's anything that telemarketing accomplishes that other forms of sale cannot so we don't understand why it's like an unfair limitation on the market rather we think it's the government just being like look even if this isn't like personal to the safety of our citizens it's still something that brings them a significant amount of distrust and irritation so we might as well keep them from having to experience this and we think the problem is that even telemarketers don't like telemarketing when it happens to themselves. So and and given that this isn't something that we think is at a significant drop off in jobs insofar as these kinds of jobs just transferred to the other form of marketing that occurs we don't think there's actually any kind of real harm to stopping this as a practice and so the fact that it is like incredibly irritating to individuals and not something that anyone wants to deal with becomes incredibly important and outweighs the majority of anything else in this round because there aren't any harmful impacts on op's upside. So it makes it something that is essentially just like look like if there's a situation that sucks and you're able to change that situation without actually harming anyone else you probably ought change that situation. Finally though, we want to talk about the insecurity of telemarketing because we think that in a world where individuals are recording our voices and using them to access our bank accounts and other voice activated media in a world in which they are listening in conversations to listen to things like our car so like our cards we have to recognize that telemarketing corporations usually don't have the money to do things like secure the lines that they are using like make sure that nobody is recording the speech that is being said and so we think that something that happens that is really problematic on their side of the house is that telemarketing campaigns are always more easily hacked than the alternatives which poses a massive security threat to the individuals who might buy something via telemarketing. Insofar as that is true we think that we ought differ to the things that are more secure so that we don't take these kinds of risks in the first place. Proud to propose.
We should introduce goal-line technology. So we're going to argue that this technology which allows referees to use a computer to check whether a goal was actually scored should be used in high level football competitions, such as the premier league, champions league, la liga, and world cup. We think that whenever possible, these technologies should be implemented in a league, but we recognize that some smaller leagues might not have the ability to do so. We think that ultimately this would be beneficial for the leagues and for football as a whole. Three arguments for our side. The first is that this should make football a more fair sport. It's important that fans perceive that a sport is fair if you want them to watch. And realize that all of the money that football teams bring in is contingent on people watching the sport. They sell advertisements and spots on TV and seats in stadia, and these are how they make all of their money. So this is very important for the leagues and the teams within them, as businesses. Goal-line technology makes the sport more fair because now you're able to objectively measure whether a given goal was scored. Right now we can have highly trained officials try to make a judgment call but at the end of the day, it will never be as accurate as having a computer make that determination. We think that when fans understand that something completely objective is determining whether or not goals have been scored, that there will be a better appearance of fairness within the league and that many people who don't watch football right now, because they think it's rigged or because they think that it's not fair, would be more likely to support the sport and spend their money on it if we introduce this goal-line technology. In particular, at a time when more sports are becoming popular in traditional football areas, such as basketball gaining popularity in europe, we think it's important for leagues and for teams to improve their reputation and improve their standing in the community. Our second argument is about accountability for officials. While match fixing is relatively rare in both football and any professional highly organized sport, we think that it's important that we take every step possible to limit match fixing. The reason why is that all of the harms listed above to having a worse reputation, such as fewer viewers and less advertising money, are greatly multiplied by the perception that the officiating is unfair. Right now, if there's a perception that popular players or popular teams are given more credit by the officials, then that feeds into all the harms we told you about earlier. Where goal-line technology makes football a better sport is that it introduces independent accountability for officials. Someone from the league or someone from fifa or another body can go in and see if the referee was actually making a legitimate call. This makes match fixing basically impossible, because referees can't lie about who scored what goal. So all of the benefits above come through uniquely from goal-line technology. Our third and final point is about having football conform to international sporting norms. While it's true that football is the most popular sport in the world, it's not growing as quickly as some other sports. Basketball, in particular, is rapidly becoming more and more popular worldwide. We think that it's important that football conform to the expectations people have for sport more broadly if it's going to grow in areas where it hasn't been as popular in the past, such as the united states, and maintain its status as the most popular sport in countries where it's very popular right now. If you're a new sports fan in america or china and you're deciding whether you want to spend more money on football or basketball, one thing you might ask yourself is which one is more fair, so or which one seems more legitimate to you. And because other sports, like basketball, like baseball, use technology comparable to goal-line technology, it's important that football do this as well so that they're able to keep fans and to attract new fans. So for all of these reasons, we should introduce goal-line technology. Thank you.
We should ban racial profiling for two reasons. First because it's a violation of rights and second because it actually makes people less safe. So first, why is racial profiling a violation of rights? Let's start by looking at the fact that it is an inherent rights violation. Why is this true? Because the because by the lottery of birth, people don't really have any control over where they're born into. That's not something that you actually choose, you don't choose the color of your skin. Or the religion that you grow up with, it's probably picked out by your parents. So why do we think that this is important? Because when you are profiling somebody on the base of their race, especially assuming criminality or terrorist motives to the basis of their race, or to a heightened presumption that they might be a perpetrator of such an action, it assigns blame to a race where it presumes blame onto a predominant group of people rather than assigning blame to individual people. This is an incredibly big problem. Because what it essentially is is a form of discrimination, because it means that the reason why someone is committing a crime is because they're a criminal because they have bad morals but that doesn't have anything to do with the color of their skin or the way in which they grew up. But this is additionally yeah besides this just being an inherent rights violation we also believe that this will likely be a rights violation in the way that it's applied. Why? Because oftentimes police are able to take advantage of the leniency of society when it comes to safety measures. This is very true in america, obviously, where you see shootings of unarmed black men on a tragically regular basis. And that oftentimes convictions rarely if if ever follow and penalties are hardly ever more than a slap on the wrist. This is clearly evident of a culture in which these things are permissible but additionally society also just scares easily. You hear about instances of street harassment and bullying, acts of hate crimes against people, acts of hate crimes against muslims and islamophobia as rampant and these things are oftentimes stroked by media fears and when you and when you allow the use of racial profiling it essentially legitimizes that race can be a characteristic that could lead you wanting to identify somebody as a terrorist in the media and things like that. So then I also think makes is like quite a violation of their rights because this is simply undeserved on their part. But the next thing that I want to talk about is that I actually think that this makes society less safe. Why is this true? So first because it creates a presumption of where the threat is coming from, or expectation of who is actually threatening you that is ultimately not all that helpful in actually fighting threats. Why? Because terrorists and criminals belong to people of all races and religions and that just because some more happen to be come from some groups of people other than other groups of people when there is racial profiling allowed it usually focuses on the most prevalent groups. This often comes at the expense of us not considering the threats that can come from people whom we may not expect them to come from. So this ultimately makes you less safe in a lot of ways too. But this is finally going to make people less safe because of the way in which the targeted groups of racial profiling react to this. So even if you can make arguments that this isn't actually a violation of rights, the reality is is that the people involved in this, the people being targeted by this, do believe it is a rights violation. What does this mean? It means that it's just another example of society condemning these people who are already oftentimes not treated very well in society at large so I think that if anything this is going to make it more likely that people are going to, on the margins, turn to extremism or terrorism or more radical sects altogether. And this is because they're going to be seen as less accepted by mainstream society. They're not going to ever feel like they're secure in their own identity. This is an incredibly this is incredibly messed up thing and it ultimately only makes it our society less safe and less secure. So for all of those reasons we should definitely ban racial profiling.
The motion for today's round is that we should ban infant circumcision, we being governments in western liberal democracies. I think the main takeaway before I get into my points of clash is that you can still make a decision to get circumcised when you are an adult, consenting male above or at the age of eighteen. The problem that we're trying to deal with is the fact that children currently get forced into systems where, without their consent or knowledge, they are forced into circumcision, and they cannot change it for the rest of their lives. Two main areas of clash, the first on bodily autonomy and the undermining of consent. Because recognize that it is a generally accepted principle that people should be able to choose what to do with their own bodies insofar as they have to live with these bodies forever, and the decisions that other people make aren't necessarily going to be short-lived and I just go on with my life after I make it. Even if you don't buy that though, people also get to make the decisions for their own bodies, because we recognize that people who like exist within those bodies tend to be the most informed and the most capable of acting on their own behalf. Insofar as they have to live with the decisions that they make for the rest of their lives, insofar as these decisions personally affect them in a way that it doesn't affect anyone else, incentives exist for me to take my own safety, security and desires in a much more serious way than anyone else would. As such, we tell you that people are the only ones who are capable of making decisions on their own behalf and when it is possible, we ought wait and let them do so. The problem is that in the status quo, parents get to make decisions that can wait until that child is eighteen, but they make them so early that the child never gets a say in the first place, even though the procedure is permanent. But we recognize already that parents don't have these kinds of infinite rights. In western liberal democracies, parents aren't legally allowed to force children into marriage, people children under eighteen can't get tattoos, and parents can't put their babies under plastic surgery until those children are at least sixteen and enthusiastic about getting it done. All we're saying is that our side of the house protects you from this permanence, first, in a legally consistent manner with what we currently allow in law, but also in a morally consistent manner. More than this though, recognize that circumcision is basically just genital mutilation. Insofar as it is just a child who is getting a part of their body removed without that child's consent, we think it is hypocritical and arbitrary that the difference is what religions use this kind of practice and where it gets used. It doesn't make it more consensual. If we look down on female genital mutilation, we ought also be looking down on circumcision. So the other side might get up here and talk about religious rights, but recognize that those rights don't extend infinitely. We don't allow the stoning of those who engage in premarital sex or the painful sacrifice of animals or female genital mutilation. If we recognize that we don't allow other religious practices because of their impact on those who cannot consent and the harm that they have, this is incredibly similar. Also, recognize that circumcision injuries are very common, especially when done by religious figures with little professional training. What this means is before I'm evil even capable of using it for the first time, I might have a deformity that I never consented into, never signed a contract to sign my rights away to, but I can never sue for. What we're saying is just that we must protect those who can't protect themselves. But next, let's talk about the way that it traps people into religion. Because we tell you that many people don't choose to follow their parents religions insofar as they grow up and find that they don't think it's consistent with their own belief systems, or they just develop their own belief systems. We think it is unjust that these people get forced to wear a mark of that religion on their bodies forever, and we think that part of the choice that we talked about is also being able to choose the religion that you want and the way in which you want to represent that religion. We think in the same way that jews can choose to wear yarmulkes in public or not, it probably ought be your decision whether or not you want to be circumcised or not, and whether that is part of how you follow that religion. In the end, male circumcision is fine when an adult is making that decision for themselves. For these reasons, proud to propose.
We should ban child actors because for two big reasons. Reason number one, because it's there's no consent because these children can't possibly know what they're getting into and what the impact is gonna have on them and for number two, because even if it is something that they can consent into ultimately the harms that are likely to come out of this are just too extreme, so the paternalism that you would exert is justified and acceptable. So first let's talk about consent. I think that obviously consent is an incredibly important part of decision making in general in a liberal society, but I think that consent and willingness is particularly important when it comes to your job and your work because otherwise you're essentially just a forced laborer. You're not actually freely engaging in work, and that's like obviously something that's very very egregious. It's actually slavery, not something that you would accept in some kind of liberal and democratic society. So let's talk about there why there's no consent in the specific circumstances then with regard to child actors and labor. So the first reason is because they're just too young. We are accept that children are incapable of consenting in a lot of ways. You have things like statutory rape in age of consent for sex, we limit ability for kids to vote, to drive, to drink, do all kinds of decision making process while they're still developing while they're also while they're under the guardianship of their parents who are responsible for them and the like. And I think this is very important because recognize that also child actors isn't just talking about teenagers or people who we perceive as maybe being more capable but oftentimes, child actors could literally mean infants. It can mean toddlers. It could mean people in elementary and middle school. It's talking about people who are even less developed than you would think of when you typically think of younger people. So I think that's a big problem. The next problem is that there could there's no there's possibility of social or parental pressure, and I think that this is very real, and I think this is very likely to be important because there's a lot profit associated with child acting. If you're a parent you can make a whole lot of money off of this possibly the famousness of your child. So there's some pressure there but there also could just be more general social pressures that just tell you that this is something that you should do you even if you don't want to and because these are the people these are the adults that you look up to they're your parents. You're probably likely to listen to them even if it's not what you want and that's not fair to kids. So we shouldn't allow that to happen. And the final reason that there's not really able to be any consent is because this is just unenforceable. It's difficult to enforce legislation that could exist and I think the reason why it's difficult to enforce a law of this legislation is like first and foremost because there's a huge profit motive behind these industries if you're talking about things like the film industry acting and things like. There's oftentimes a lot of lobbying incentives, a lot of like financial incentives, a lot of motives to maybe do things like legal settlements rather than create boxes things like that. All kinds of things that make it so more likely than not you're not actually going to see enforcement. So I don't think that that's very good on that front. So next I want to talk about just like the degree of impact that this actually has on children because I think that in a lot of ways the stress of working from a young age, the stress of having no timelines, to having to go in front of large audiences constantly, the the pressure of all of these things from your job oftentimes this can result in like a lot of sadness for children. It can result in a social isolation not growing up with a lot of friendships with people their own age because you're mostly around like professionals in a field or staff and things like that, and I think that this has a real adverse developmental effect on children and I think that this could be the reason why it's more likely that a lot of child actors end up with psychological problems or mental health issues. There's obviously examples of that. So for all those reasons I definitely think that we should bad child actors.
We should increase fuel taxes. So this is a debate talking about taxes on gas or petrol, taxes on diesel, taxes on natural gas for heating homes, any sort of fossil fuel that is used as fuel by the general public. We think there should be higher taxes on it then there are right now in the status quo. In the US for instance, this might take the form of rising gas taxes at the state level. So two arguments. First, how do we reduce the use of fossil fuels? We think that right now there is an enormous cost to society from the use of fossil fuels by individuals. If you look at things like rising CO two levels and pollution that the government has to clean up, we see that there are lots of costs to people choosing to drive gasoline cars, or to heat their homes with natural gas, and that most people use these methods over other methods because they are cheaper right now. So if we make these methods more expensive, then one, people are paying the cost of the damage that they're doing more directly, and two, suddenly it makes sense for them to actually use other fuel sources instead. Right now for instance, buying energy that's produced only through solar power rather than coal might be more expensive than buying electricity from a plant that produces by coal. But by driving up the cost of electricity produced by burning coal, everyone will switch over to the cheaper solar powered energy. We think that this is an effective tool because people one, want to have the lowest cost possible, and two, deserve to have to pay for the harms that they incur on the rest of society. People shouldn't be able to freeload off of the government cleaning up after their pollution and mitigating the damage of their carbon dioxide. The big impact of all this is that we think that the amount of CO two omitted would be much lower. Many fewer people would choose to drive on their own, or to drive cars that use gas rather than hybrids. Many fewer people would heat their homes using fossil fuels, and ultimately, national emissions would go way down, and this would make a more sustainable environment in the future. So we think that's enough to win the debate. But our second argument is about funding alternatives, because right now there's a lack of money actually going into finding alternatives to fossil fuels. So why do we solve this? First of all, we can earmark the money from the tax to go to developing alternative energy sources. For instance, money that goes to or is raised by taxing coal emissions could be put towards building solar plants, or researching better solar technology. Money that goes or is brought in from a gasoline tax might be put towards encouraging more people to drive cars powered by liquid natural gas, or encouraging people to drive more electric cars instead. Perhaps we could give tax credits for electric cars, and in general make it easier for people to upgrade their old dirty technology to new, clean technology. And on top of that, whereas right now there isn't a lot of infrastructure for the use of clean energy, we think that that infrastructure could be created on our side using this tax. In other words, there are some people who will have to use fossil fuels no matter what, like certain big businesses that produce electricity, certain long haul trucks, et cetera. These groups won't be able to cut back on use. So money is going to be coming in from these taxes. At the end of the day, therefore, we think that it is better to spend this money on infrastructure for the future, rather than to put it into a general fund where it'll just get sort of frittered away, and eventually we won't have that income as no one uses gas anymore. So on our side we take advantage of the fact that we have this temporarily really high revenue stream, and use it to plan for a better future. In this case that would be investing in things like charging stations for electric cars, or other ways for people to heat their homes, and ultimately we think that this will make the country more sustainable in the long term. So because we reduce CO two emissions, and because we better future proof our country, we think that we should increase fuel taxes. Thank you.
Global warming is a major threat, not just a major threat, it's an existential threat for three reasons. First, because basic human habitability of our planet is on the line. Second, mass starvation is on the line. And third, super-powerful, wide damaging, natural disasters will be more frequent and more destructive, all things that are quite bad and certainly constitute major threats. So let's start by talking about basic habitability. Global warming is going to lead to glaciers melting and ice caps melting, and it's estimated that sea levels are going to rise as a result of this. It's a phenomenon that we've already started to see happening. So this is a problem because most people live on the coast. You look at major population centers in the united states, for example. You look at places like new york, boston, miami, florida, washington DC, you look on the west coast, you look at places throughout california, you look in places like in you look at places in like europe. This is also a phenomena. Tel aviv is on the water as well. This is going to be a big problem. So, these places can be under water if there's too much flooding. There could be widespread flooding. Parts of these cities can be uninhabitable, or entire sections can be uninhabitable. For context of what this looks, like you could essentially imagine the devastation in new orleans after hurricane katrina where the entire area was flooded. Imagine that but everywhere, and imagine that everywhere constantly and not just sporadically when there's a rare natural disaster like that. This is quite bad and it will make basic cities that we've had unlivable. This at worst means that everything that we've previously built there is going to be unusable and we're gonna have to leave. So that's like very very bad. At the best-case scenario you can imagine is that it's going to cost incredibly large amounts of money to fix this problem, things that we probably don't even have the access to, building levees across an entire nation, things like that. But, an additional problem is the idea about starvation. So, a lot of food can't grow outside of specific temperature rains ranges. So if it gets too hot, wheat won't grow. If it gets too if it gets too cold, maybe like fruit will stop growing or vegetables will die. So this becomes a big problem because through global warming, you're also going to see a continued desertification as well. So you're going to be seeing that certain like soil nutrients are gonna be more lacking. So in addition to like temperature range going on, you're also going to see soil entire soil areas be less conducive to growing. So a concept of what this looks like is you could look at things like the dust bowl in you could look at like dust bowl problems in oklahoma. You could think about trying to grow an orange tree in the sahara desert or trying to grow wheat in the sahara desert. It's probably not going to work very well for you. Imagine this is a global phenomena. Food is going to be more expensive and it's going to be less available. This will lead to billion like millions of people dying probably, something that's very bad. But finally, it's important to focus on natural disasters. When you're talking about natural disasters, it's no secret that we've had record-high temperatures, and we've also had heat waves that have killed people. So you look at the recent heat wave in pakistan that resulted in numerous deaths. When you look at hurricanes, they're more vicious than ever, that are going to completely rip apart places. When you look at storm surges that have never been as high before, when you look at historically destructive winters like the one that we had in boston a couple of years ago, these things are happening at a greater frequency than they ever had. And these things happen because of climate change, because increases in temperature make it so that hurricanes can be more destructive and they can grow more frequently. When you look at record cold, these things are global warming is not necessarily the most precise term, climate change is a better term, and oftentimes these things happen as a result of that. This obviously can result in mass human casualties, mass infrastructural damage, mass like work in lack of productivity in a lot of contexts, all things that are quite bad. So for all of those reasons, global warming is an incredibly major threat.
We should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools. So a zero tolerance policy is a very strict enforcement of school rules that bans the possession of certain items or that prohibits certain behaviors. So an example of this might be that if we had a zero tolerance policy, we might suspend anybody involved in a fight, no matter whether they started it or why the fight ultimately began or their role in participating. We would suspend everyone equally. That would be an example of a zero tolerance policy for fighting. So a couple of reasons why we should actually implement these policies. The first is that existing punishments are likely to be arbitrary without a zero tolerance policy. And we think that this is likely to break down on certain biased lines. For instance, right now, basically when you don't have a zero tolerance policy, you rely on teachers or principles to make a value judgment about whether a student deserves to be punished. Maybe they make good decisions sometimes, but other times they likely make very poor decisions. It seems quite likely to me that white teachers and administrators might be more likely to punish young black boys in school for fighting than they would be to punish white boys because of the empathy gap between people of different races. They're more likely to be charitable towards someone of their own race than other people. So we think that the only way to implement policies that are not left up to the racism or internalized biases of administrators and teachers, is to have the same policy for everyone. Namely a zero tolerance policy. The other side is going to say, well that just hurts everyone it doesn't help anybody. But I think it's quite likely that if you implement these policies that you'll see a reform of school rules to reflect common sense better. In other words, if you suddenly have a wave of boys being suspended for fighting, then maybe the penalties for fighting will be made less severe. I don't know, they'll have to write, I will not get into fights, on the white board a hundred times or something like that. So we think that ultimately this is less arbitrary and will lead to better policies in terms of actually preventing disciplinary infractions. Which leads nicely to our second argument about better deterrence. In order to prevent young people from misbehaving in school you need to offer some deterrence. We think that extrinsic motivation is important to getting young people to do the right thing because they haven't yet had the kind of moral education that leads them to have this intrinsic motivation to do the right thing. So how do we deter people? If you know that being charming or funny can get you out of an offense, because there's no zero tolerance policy, than many students will do the wrong thing and then be able to get away with it. We think that a zero tolerance policy means students will have to accept the costs of their actions, be responsible for what they've done, and not be able to weasel out of it. And that this will lead to a stronger deterring effect than what you would see if you didn't have such a policy in place. When students think that they can just weasel out of anything they've done wrong. Our third argument is that we think this helps students out on the aggregate. Realize that if you think about the eighty-twenty rule, probably twenty percent of students cause eighty percent of the problems. We think that at that point it's important to remove trouble makers from the classroom so that the majority of students are able to learn and benefit themselves. We think that right now if you don't have zero tolerance policies, then the students who act up, who get into fights, who cause trouble, are likely to continue that behavior to the detriment of every other student who just wants to learn and try to get ahead in life. So we think that while zero tolerance policies may fall harshly on certain individuals, that they benefit the aggregate because most students wouldn't be affected by this policy because they behave and don't cause trouble. At that point, we should adopt this policy because it allows us to reward good behavior, punish bad behavior, and allocate more resources to the students who actually want to learn as opposed to students who want to cause trouble and mischief. So for these reasons we should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools. Thank you.
We should abolish personality tests. So there are a wide array of personality tests that currently exist on the market, so we're just going to create a model to make it clear what we're talking about. We're not talking about like buzzfeed posting a personality test that someone will take in a two minute period and then move on with their life to find out which disney character they're most like. We're talking about personality tests that are instituted by either schools or businesses to try and see what someone's career aptitude might be or to see whether or not someone's personality may fit into your corporate culture. We would ban the use of personality tests for these types of purposes and in any sort of official structure, any sort of long of lengthy personality tests, so like the myers briggs test we would eliminate that. And in the status quo we see a problem of two things. Either these tests are immensely broad, which means they don't have any sort of predictive power or they have a problem of confirmation bias, in which people may see them as personally successful, may see their personality reflected in a myers briggs test. But that's because they see a confirmation of what they already believe about themselves or they confirm these things in their everyday life. But we think the larger problem of all of these things is that people simply cannot be boiled down to their separate aspects of their personality. We think that individuals are far too complex as as human beings and that the interactions between a variety of different personality aspects can lead to individuals being immensely different from each other, even if they have the same myers briggs personality type or something like this. And we think even if it was the case that these personality tests were reflective of one's personality, if you could accurately boil down someone's personality into one personality test, we think the problem is that personality is something that's fluid. It's something that changes over one's life and in one's environment. For example, people often believe that one needs to have a certain personality trait to be a leader, but they need to be an extrovert, but what's been found in studies is that when individuals are given the opportunity to be a leader, they adapt to those types of traits. See bill gates who's become a leader on the global stage, but started as an introverted individual who wasn't comfortable speaking in front of large groups of people. We think that personality is very highly likely to fluctuate over one's life and therefore taking personality tests seriously and taking the results of these things seriously can have really bad ramifications. For example, certain businesses use personality tests in order to judge potential employees. But we think that firstly, personal references are much more likely to be personal and more in depth and give you a better understanding of who an individual is, secondly, as I already said, environment matters. Which means denying someone a job opportunity simply because their personality in the past isn't what you're looking for, doesn't mean that they can't evolve to fill your work space. And thirdly, mood has and immense impact on personality tests and the mood that you're in when you're taking a personality test, what you're thinking about in the moment when you're taking the personality test, can have a really drastic impact on who you on on what these tests say about you, what they think you are. And we think that there is a massive problem in the status quo, people taking these things too seriously which can lead to one, an internal crisis of identity in which people believe that these tests have validity and that they have a misunderstanding of who they are fundamentally when they otherwise wouldn't have this sort of crisis of self identity, and externally, we think that there are mistreatments of individuals insofar as people have a certain expectation based on a boiled down personality type, which simply is not an accurate reflection of the person they're interacting with as a human being. We think that personality tests simply miss the boat and don't accurately represent what a human being is and they don't accurately represent how an environment plays a role in personality. And for these reasons we should abolish personality tests.
We should adopt teacher tenure reform. So this debate is about tenure for primarily secondary school teachers in countries like the united states. Presently in many school systems, like the one in chicago, teachers have tenure. Which means that after they've worked at a school for a certain number of years they can only be fired for sort of gross misconduct. Otherwise, generally speaking, they keep their jobs no matter how well they perform or what they do. Two arguments for why we need to reform teacher tenure. And by reform we mean make it easier for principles or school boards to remove teachers who have been at a school for a long time. So two arguments. First: this aligns the incentives of teachers with those of society and allows us to reward good behavior. What do I mean by this? Right now if you're a teacher who has tenure you don't really care if your students are succeeding. Maybe you're a good person and you became a teacher for pure motives, and we certainly think that's the case for most people, but there are also people who become a teacher and don't really care if their students learn anything. Maybe they just read out of the book in class or they show movies, etcetera. But we tell you that by introducing tenure reform, suddenly you can make it so that teachers only succeed if their students succeed. In other words you can attach things like salary increases or job security to certain performance by students on standardized or local testing. What this means is that suddenly teachers have every reason to try to teach as best as possible. Right now the only motivation that teachers have is intrinsic. To do a good job because they care about the kids. In our world, suddenly there's extrinsic motivation as well. Namely the possibility of gaining bonuses or having job security. And as an aside from this I'd like to point out that in our world we can reward good teachers. We don't just have to punish bad ones. We can give people bonuses if all of their students get into college, things like that. Something that can't happen right now because tenure prevents us from awarding the good teachers as well because we're spending all of this money on the bad teachers. And this leads nicely into my second argument about how this would improve the financial state of schools. So the way that teachers salary generally works is you start out making a pretty low salary and then if you stay at the same school for a long time eventually you make a very high salary. So what that means is that right now we have lots of elderly teachers who don't have a lot of incentive to care about the students who are collecting large paychecks. Meanwhile there might be younger teachers who are better qualified or more able to actually invest themselves emotionally in helping their students who can't get jobs because we can't fire these older teachers. We have to wait for them to retire. So in our world we tell you that first of all, we could lay off teachers who are not performing and hire new teachers which would save money because we're getting more bang for our buck, so to speak, from a better teacher. But on top of that, that it's more likely that we could hire young teachers to replace older ones who are no longer, you know, up to date on a certain field or no longer performing at a high level. This is some huge impacts because money is so fungible within the school system. If we spend less money paying bad teachers, and recognize, this isn't just a matter of paying someone ten thousand dollars more than someone else to teach algebra. There are teachers in new york who can't be fired but who are so bad that they sit in a room all day and get paid for it. To do nothing. So we can get rid of people like that and reinvest that money into hiring people like special needs teachers, like ESL teachers, to fill gaps that we have right now in our education system. At that point we think this will be a clear good for the children who should have our foremost consideration, because education exists to benefit them and secondly for the school system as a whole, because they can allocate resources more effectively. So for these reasons we should institute teacher tenure reform. Thank you.
We should subsidize investigative journalism. So before I get into my arguments I'd like to very shortly define what we're debating about. We're talking about long form or even a video media which promotes a higher understanding of current events or important issues in society based on original investigation by journalists. And this will be provided to the companies which are producing this journalism be that the new york times or other similar private organizations. And by subsidize we just mean provide funds to make this feasible for them to produce. So with that in mind three arguments. The first is that investigative journalism is a public service. In order for a democracy to function it relies on the availability of information on which voters can base their decisions. If voters lack access to good information then they aren't able to intelligently vote or to know what is in their own interests. So ultimately we require institutions like the media to provide people that information. But in the same way that ultimately we have private operators provide things that are a public service in other instances such as access to television or sometimes even water and what we do that with subsidies we can do that with journalism is well. We don't think that this will be a conflict of interest for the journalists because ultimately they're still beholden to the company that employs them and that company is free to use private funding for all the instances when they would do so in the status quo. Our second argument is that this is necessary to combat the influence of big business and the super rich. A handful of influential people like rupert murdoch or ted turner have an outsized influence on what the media portrays. So these individuals are able to control narratives that rightfully should be determined only by the facts or by public interest. When someone like rupert murdoch is able to influence the public in a very outsized way to vote against a certain candidate because of his interest rather than their own we think that that does a disservice to democracy. And ultimately the only way to combat this outsized influence exercised by certain wealthy individuals is to provide an alternative source of funding because of these people's power is derived from their ability to fund journalism then the only way to remove that power is to provide an alternative source of funding for journalism. We think that subsidies for investigative journalism is the most effective way to do this and that it's the only way to prevent these groups who having to much control over the public discourse and the public narrative. We think that the government is a better agent to influence public opinion than any private source because ultimately it acts on the public interest and because it's controlled by trustees who represent the public rather than by privately interested individuals. And our third and final point is that this is consistent with other media subsidies which governments provide. Consider the existence of things like the BBC which are heavily subsidized by governments or by taxes. We think that many countries around the world have some form of state media already. Subsidies for investigative journalism are can completely in keeping with this principle. So in our world what this looks like is the BBC conducting investigative journalism. We would also be okay with the british government providing funding to private newspapers as well but we think that will be consistent with the using the BBC to fulfill the same end. And at the point where so many governments already have state owned media companies we think it's clear that governments have taken an interest in providing the public access to good information and that the only thing that we're adding in this motion is a specific focus on this type of journalism. For all these reasons we should subsidize investigative journalism. Thank you.
Politics in the united states are fractured. The political system has reached a stalemate. The reason this is happening, is because of a widening divide between parties. Take a look for example at the most recent elections, the popular candidates on either side are becoming more and more extreme. Bernie sanders version of socialist politics have never been so popular in the united states, and on the other side people like ted cruz and the eventual winner donald trump, have been massively more right wing than most of their predecessors. The problem this creates, is by ever widening the gap between the parties, you make it more and more difficult to cross the aisle, more and more difficult for both sides to cooperate, something that is usually necessary in order to pass laws, in order to create effective change, and in order to help the people. How do we solve this? We enact open primaries. What do those look like? There's a popular vote in all states together. Two such votes happen, one for each party. Each party has a primary, the candidates running in those primaries must be affiliated with the party, meaning we weed out trojan horses and things like that. How do we think this ends up solving the situation? So what happens the day after tomorrow, is that the entire country gets to vote on who the democratic nominee is and the entire country gets to vote on who the republican nominee is. This means democrats are choosing a republican and republicans are choosing a democrat. However, this keeps happening from within the party, meaning the democrats that the republicans are choosing is still by definition a democrat. This does a few things. The first thing it does is get votes for the closest to the center nominee within the party because that is a person who, for example if we're talking about the democratic party, republicans would be most comfortable with in the general election. The second thing it does is centralize the supposedly democratic candidates as well, because it now becomes politically advantageous for them to advocate for more central policies, to show more ability to cross the aisle, and to cooperate. For two reasons, one because it gets them votes from primary voters on the other side of the aisle, but two because if you assume a, to an extent, pragmatic voter, it means that democrats now see that in order to get a candidate they want they can't veer too far to the right. So they have the incentive to centralize as well and this happens on both sides of the aisle. What do you lose from this? They'll tell us on opposition extremist ideas are important, they're important for discourse, they're important for politics etcetera. Here's the thing. We don't think you lose the discourse because extremists will always get more stage time, because what they're saying is more shocking, more valuable as far as the media is concerned. You get their discourse, you just don't get their negative effect on policy making itself. You don't get their ability to stagnate the entire political system. So by allowing everyone to vote, you incentivize everyone to calm down just a little bit, vote just a little less extreme and get politicians who can now work together in order to make the country better and you still have the extreme discourse which is sometimes necessary to shake things up. Please propose.
Community service should be mandatory. By community service we mean unpaid work that is done to improve the community that people live in in some way. So this might vary from things like picking up trash to mowing public grass on the side of the road and anything else of similar nature done by volunteers. We have three arguments for why we think that this type of community service should be mandatory. The first is that we think that this would improve the way that people treat their environment. If people are forced to do work to maintain their community, then it's much more likely that they'll feel invested in its well being. People who have seen how difficult it is to keep a neighborhood clean are probably less likely to litter. People who are aware of the expenses that are put into maintaining public property are less likely to damage that property. Similarly, we think it's more likely that people will take pride in their community when they've had a part in making it a better place. So not only would this reduce negative behavior because people wouldn't want to have to deal with the effects of that behavior, but it would also reduce antisocial behavior because people would feel more proud of their community in the first place. So we think that as a result of this people would have more buy-in to the community, to positive values, to things that are social rather than antisocial, and also feel more of a sense of ownership in their community which would ultimately make them more likely to do things for other people and to benefit themselves as well when they help out the people around them. Our second argument is quite simply that this would be a public good. Ultimately we think that if people did this that it would reduce the amount of money that the government has to spend on maintaining that community and also moreover that people who aren't able to do this type of work for themselves would be able to benefit. So for instance, perhaps we would have volunteers mowing lawns for the elderly and that sort of thing. Become a benefit that accrues from those with the most to give to those who have the greatest need. So we think that ultimately this would really serve to benefit those people who are worse off in the community. And our final argument is that we think that it's important to have some sort of service to replace military service. Most countries today have phased out mandatory military service. Previously most young men, when they graduated from school, would spend a year or two in the military and learn skills and discipline and other useful habits in that way. Now instead what we see is that many people, men and women, graduate from school and they don't have a job immediately, they don't have anything to do, and they turn to antisocial behavior. So whereas before we had the military as a very expensive jobs program, we think that now we could replace it with the more socially beneficial program in the form of this community service. We could give young people something that would teach them job skills or teach them productive life habits, keep them doing something positive rather than something negative, and also put something on their resume for when they apply for jobs. So ultimately we think that this would be very beneficial to establishing good character and to providing a type of education that was once provided by mandatory military service. So ultimately this kind of both practical vocational and civic education that would accrue from this type of mandatory service would be a huge benefit to young people. Although we think many people might resent having to participate in this when it's first implemented, ultimately because it would be for their own good we think that it's something that society should require anyway. So for all of these reasons, community service should be mandatory. Thank you.
We should subsidize higher education. We believe that there is a right to education that can only be fulfilled by not only allowing for primary education but also for free university and secondary education for all. We think that this right exist for a couple of reasons: the most important reason that this right exists is because of what the obligation to state are to the people and why the state exist generally in the first place. We think that the state exist in order to provide for equal access to opportunity for its citizens. Individuals are born into the circumstances that are outside of their control, meaning that random chance determines many factors that will place them and determine what opportunities they have such as the money that their family has that they're born into, their race, their gender, and other such factors that impede them in both the way that people treat them through biases but also through just the ability that they have to get a good education, good tutoring, access to jobs, things of the like. So what do we think a free secondary education does? Free secondary education allows for all people to have access not just to low paying service sector jobs but also to higher paying specialized jobs such as those in growing tech industries, in medical industries, legal industries, things that allow individuals to exceed what their ordinary circumstances would have allowed. Because many people have the ability to be educated many people do well in high school and primary education but don't have the opportunity to go further because they don't have the means to pay for that and while colleges to subsidize individuals we think that this isn't enough to ensure that the most people can go and it simply doesn't do enough level playing for as the state is obliged to do. Further, even if even if you don't believe that there's a right to education per se at this level, we think that there's no meaningful distinction between the delineation we make between the education we give to elementary primary and secondary education and that education that you would achieve from a university. There's no major distinction between the educational barriers or the educational benefits that come between these two parts, except that there's a greater benefit the more educated one is, because of the job opportunities available to them. Given that this is the case, we don't think there's any reasonable distinction to be drawn between the two and if we believe as we do in a society that does fund these types of education, that you should fund primary and secondary education, there's no meaningful reason why you ought not continue to fund , university education. Furthermore, there's an important benefit to society that comes from these things and namely that when you allow people to exceed what their expectations would be otherwise you break cycles of poverty that are incredibly costly to the state. People that live in these impoverished situations benefit from state welfare programs for a long period of time, which is a major expenditure for states that would be avoided if more individuals were able to break out of the cycle of poverty that are dictated by their circumstances when they're born. Given that higher education allows you to get off of things like food stamps programs, medic-aid programs, free health and social service programs, we think that the state in the long run will save money by investing money now into people's futures so that they can build for themselves the lives tey want. Also, why do we think that this is going to be an affordable program? So we think that there are many ways of doing this in which you can be more affordable than simply paying for every single person to go to high-school or go to college. We think that there are ways to ensure that when people can afford to pay they do pay so that they subsidize other individuals, but that for, say, state universities that education is made free to anyone, or the amount of money that they can feasibly pay is the only amount of money that they need to pay so that all need is met by the state universities in in essence subsidizing these things to a great extent. You can also make state universities free and provide for these money, for these institutions through money that's spent in other ways such as money that goes to these, social welfare services and things like that, especially because in the long run those services are going to be less costly to the state. So may cost a little bit of money in the in the current term, you may have to take on deficits but that's worth in the long run. You can also subsidize these schools up front in a way that's called pay it forward, where individuals are able to go to university for free and for a certain amount of years after they graduate pay a certain percentage of their income, maybe ten percent of their income each month, to the university that they went to so that they never have to take on a debt burden that they can't afford, they never take on massive student loans to go to university and they can go to the university of their choosing without having to pay money in the instances where they have no job, they have no disposable income, they're the least able to pay for their college university experience. And they can go on to the future and actually get proper value based on how much money that degree served them. And for these reasons we think that we should subsidize college education.
Prenatal diagnosis does more good than harm for two big reasons. First, it's better for the parents, and second, it's better for the possible future child in the long run. So first, why is it better for the parents. As far as financial costs are concerned, there is incredibly exorbitant ones oftentimes, and the reason for this is because people who have diseases or disabilities often require two things: they require specialized care and accommodations, and they require medical treatment. Both of these things cost money. In fact, both of these things often cost quite a bit of money. For disabilities and diseases, especially ones that are less common, these can often have incredibly high healthcare costs, especially in places like the united states. And additionally, oftentimes getting care or assistance, getting special equipment to deal with somebody, or getting a special person to watch over somebody who's qualified to look after somebody with disabilities, these can also be incredibly hefty expenses, expenses that first, a lot of people can't afford at all, and secondarily, it's also can be an expense that people just aren't prepared to invest, because people have the choice to make that that's a choice people can make with their lives, if they think that spending that much money and that much time is worth it. And the next thing is the emotional costs that are put on parents. Because it's important to consider that parents are real people, that they're not these infallible human beings that we should thrust moral obligations on too lightly. They're regular people and while we should celebrate many parents who would be willing to give all of the love, care and support to somebody with disease and disabilities, a lot of parents simply just aren't the right kind of people to put that emotional energy into it, and simply will just feel drained and upset the possibly while doing that. And we think that that's a legitimate thing that people should be concerned about. If they simply do not think that they are the right kind of person that they can burden themselves with having to care for somebody, oftentimes possibly throughout their entire lives they might have to care for this person, that could be a burden that they're just not prepared to take, and it could be incredibly draining. That's an important consideration, and therefore something that can be prevented by prenatal diagnosis. But the next thing that I want to talk about is the impact this has on kids. Because the problem is that oftentimes, existing in our society with a disability can be incredibly debilitating for you. Oftentimes there's bullying and teasing towards people who look different or act differently, because they're because kids can just be mean or they don't have an understanding of what people's conditions often are, but additionally it can oftentimes be difficult in our society to find accommodations that are helpful. It could be difficult to get the right education with if you have a learning disability. It could be difficult to do things like walk upstairs sometimes if there's no elevator present. There's a whole lot of things in society that just make it more difficult for you to exist in a lot of ways. So I think that this could have a couple of pretty major impacts. The first of which is that with especially with regards to the bullying and the teasing, you may feel this may increase your likelihood of mental illness, depression, a whole lot of other things there. It could also oftentimes lead to social alienation or not being able to have as many friends. But this also means that you're going to have your job and career prospects severely hurt, not for any fault of your own, but because we simply don't exist in a society that is prepared to accommodate, which is rather unfortunate but a sad truth. Look, here is. And the final thing that I want to talk about is the actual moral costs that this that this is accumulating, as a harm to conflict to what this could be. Because obviously there are harms that are extant here. But the problem is that we're not murdering anybody, I don't actually think that there's any real moral cost here, because I would say as a good standard as for whether or not you're actually accumulating a moral harm, it would would be the sentience of an actual actor, the the average sentience of a human being. And since they're so young, it's the point of which they're not able to have any kind of sensory inputs at all, they can't eat, think, breathe, really do anything, I don't actually think that it's really even worthwhile considering someone at this such early stage of development as actually viable. And therefore there's no real actual moral harm in possibly aborting this fetus during after the results of prenatal diagnosis. And it's for all of those reasons we're incredibly proud to propose.
We should ban extreme sports. So by this we mean we think that the governments of liberal countries should close down things like the x games and other organizers of extreme sports. They should ban youth participation, and they should limit or ban the sale of equipment for these types of sports. And by extreme sports we mean, broadly speaking sports that present extreme risk to participants and are not part of traditional sporting activities. So something like parkour in some parts of the world might count as an example of this. So with that said, two big arguments. The first is about the need for state intervention. I think that the most important question for a debate like this is should the government intervene to prevent the behavior that's going on. So we're going to set up two reasons for why we think there's a need for state intervention. The first is about an asymmetry of access to information between the people participating in the sport, and the big businesses that are profiting from promoting and selling equipment for the sport. Extreme sports generally pander to a much younger audience than traditional sports, like soccer or baseball. We see that young people have less experience in life and less ability to make decisions about whether or not something is actually a good way for them to spend their time, or to get risk, because they have less experience and haven't been exposed to the same types of things that other people have. So because these sports prey uniquely on young people and encourage them to participate in very risky activities that older people might recognize are not a good idea, we think that there is a certain amount of abuse taking place here, where you have older people taking advantage of young people's lack of knowledge and information, in order to sell them products that ultimately put them at risk. We think that this there is a power imbalance here between the promoters and the consumers, and that the government is the natural actor to step in to level this power imbalance, because the government has the interest of young people at heart, because they're citizens, and can actually step in to help them. We think that there are also harms to third parties because of extreme sports. If you think about the families of these athletes when they become injured who have to care for them, and the burden on health care systems. We think that ultimately it's not as though the only person being harmed is the person participating in the sport, this actually affects many more people than just them. Therefore we think the state ought to step in to protect the interest of those people who also deserve consideration by the government. Our second argument is about why we think that this is bad for sporting culture or why we think extreme sports are bad for sporting culture. So first of all, pretty much all extreme sports are individual events that don't focus on like teamwork, or working with a coach in a way that traditional sports do. The other team might get up here and say, oh well, singles tennis doesn't promote teamwork either, but at least then you actually are working with a team of people to improve, you're probably training with a team at your university or your school, and you have a coach. So we think that that actually does promote teamwork, even if it's not necessarily a team event. Whereas because extreme sports tend to not be organized on a university level because they're too dangerous, or on a school level, things like that, ultimately you're not going to be working with a team of people to improve, it's very individual. And we think that one of the biggest benefits that sports offer to young people is to teach them how to be part of a team, how to be a leader, how to work with other people that they don't get along with, and ultimately you lose out in all these benefits. And because most people have a limited time to devote to sporting activity, we think that there is a tradeoff here, you're going to have fewer people doing traditional sports that have all of these benefits if more people are doing extreme sports as a result. We also tell you that this is probably going to lead to a lesser quality of competition in things like collegiate leagues and international athletics as well. We think that if more of our best athletes are going into extreme sports, one they're simply not competing for things like the olympics or like the world cup or international leagues, but on top of that more of our best athletes in the country are being tragically injured at a young age. So even if governments traditionally don't involve themselves to? Heavily in sports, clearly they do have an interest in protecting their best athletes to represent them on the international stage, and also protecting young people who are being taken advantage of. So for these reasons we should ban extreme sports.
We should raise corporate tax. By this we mean to say that corporations should be taxed at a higher rate and more consistently in countries around the globe. In the status quo, many large corporations, like apple, are based in countries like ireland that have low tax rates, even though they do most of their business in the US or other EU countries with higher tax rates. Basically, companies are moving to countries with lower tax rates in order to avoid having to pay taxes on their income. We propose a couple of solutions to this. Firstly, we think that corporations should be taxed on their income in your country. So when apple does business in germany, say, they should be subject to german corporate tax rates rather than irish ones, even though apple headquarters is in ireland. We think that this is fair because, ultimately, when apple does business in germany, they're benefiting from german infrastructure, from german laws, they're using german courts, and they're competing with other businesses operating in germany. Since ireland doesn't contribute to that process at all, we don't think that they should be the ones taxing apple for this income, rather it should be germany, and it would hold true if it was in britain or the states or any other country as well. Secondly, we think that one way that this could be done would be to tax infrastructure and other forms of permanent spending. In other words, if apple creates retail spaces in germany, we can tax those, and they can't be moved elsewhere if they want to sell ipods and computers in the country. So there's no way for them to get around this. We think that for other businesses with less real property, we could still find ways to tax them on the investments they do create in a country, such as transferring money into and out of a given country's economy. So now that you understand how we would do this, let's talk about why. First of all, we tell you that these companies have a duty to the state because they reap benefits from doing business there. Right? If a country does business if a company does business in a country, then they're using their courts and they're benefiting from their laws, and these cost money to maintain. So because companies benefit from the rule of law, they'd ought have to contribute to maintaining that rule of law. So when apple sues another company in german courts, they're taking up huge amounts of the german government's time and resources, and they should have to pay something in for that. And some people might say, " oh, well, a relatively low tax rate would account for that, " but my next point explains why the corporate tax rate should be relatively high. We think that more of the burden of taxation should fall on corporations than individuals. In many countries around the world, individuals pay tax rates as high as forty percent on their income. We think that this is absurd when corporations are often paying less than fifteen percent. There are a few reasons for this: one, corporations are treated as legal people, which means they should be subject to the same legal obligations as all other people, namely, paying taxes on their income. Giving a preferential rate to corporations is effectively discriminating against non-corporation legal people, namely, the rest of us. So we think that this is unfair. But we also think that the burden of taxation should fall on those most able to pay. This is the guiding principle behind progressive taxation which exists in basically every democracy already. Because corporations don't have children to feed or they don't have dependents to take care of, we think that they can afford to pay much larger taxes on their profits than any individual. And you might say, " oh, well, they have to pay their employees and pay for infrastructure, " but we're talking about profits here, what they bring in after all of those considerations. So we don't think this would prevent them from doing business, only reduce the amount of their profits that gets funneled offshores or to wealthy executives. For all these reasons, we should raise the corporate tax. Thank you.
We should ban homeopathy. In times when societies are massively misinformed by fake news sites perpetuated on social media, or bubbles don't allow people to to, receive alternative points of view to inform them, we think it's important that in this time in particular government stepped forward to make sure that there is an informed citizenry. Not only because it's good for people's individual health, but because it's also good for the collective communal health and for the costs that are associated with that healthcare and up-keep, we think it's important that homeopathy is bad. Recognize that there is no meaningful scientific research to support homeopathy as a real way to cure any sort of ailment. Curing ailments through homeopathy is just as effective as taking sugar pills and being lied to and told that it's actually aspirin or something of the like. It's simply a product of the placebo effect and nothing more than that. So there's no healthcare reason why individuals should be able to take this stance. It's only the only feasible reason why individual should be able to use homeopathy, is because they are free to do with their body what they will. But we don't think that this freedom is permanent. We don't think that people can do anything with their body when it has an impact on those around them, nor do we think that other people can be told what to do with their body, especially when it has negative healthcare consequences. So why should we ban homeopathy? First and foremost, when people are misinformed we think they make poor decisions that impact their health. Just because homeopathy has no scientific basis to show that it works doesn't mean that people don't believe that it does. And while people may be afraid of traditional medicine, when they think the comparisons between traditional medicine, which may work but is also scary and they don't understand it, and homeopathy which is supported by voodoo science, where people think there are no negative side effects and it's an entirely natural and something that your body is more easily able to take in, but also effective, we think that they're making a choice between two false options. Things that are drastically not correct and that can't be properly weighed for the individual in making their decision. Furthermore, it's important to recognize that when homeopathy is allowed and allowed to be credited as something that people can do to treat themselves, this has impacts on what parents can do for their children. For example, the parents believe that it's bad for you to take traditional medicine but that homeopathy works well, children can be exposed to a lack of vaccinations and other medications that can be crucial for their health. And children don't have a meaningful choice over whether or not they're going to do this nor do they have a choice of whether or not they're going to be inculcated into this false belief. Which means that in this particular relationship when you allow homeopathy, not only does it mean that health of the child is harmed in the short run, and possibly in the long run if major steps aren't taken to prevent really dangerous diseases like cancer and other things that can be life threatening, but it also means that if that child survives and is able to continue on in their life, it's going to be much more difficult for them to learn that homeopathy is not effective and to make decisions moving forward that would be the most healthy for them. So, those are ways in which individuals both on their own level and in their relations with others use homeopathy to harm themselves and those around them even if they may not be doing it intentionally. The other reason why we should ban homeopathy is because when people do get sick because they choose not to get actual medication, and rather choose to use homeopathy, those medical costs still accrue and people are still forced to pay those medical costs. It's just that the people that are sick don't pay these medical costs themselves, those costs get passed on to the public. So when someone is ill in the united states and they go to the hospital or in many other developed countries, and they can't pay those bills because they don't have insurance, or because they waited too long and the decease got too powerful for them to to get a simple cure to, those costs get passed on to the taxpayer and the taxpayer then, through programs like medicare and medicaid and other and other sorts of subsidies, are forced to pay those costs moving forward. So we think that from a simple economics base it's important to ban homeopathy. Because we think there would be a massive reduction in costs in the medical service, in the medical program that are borne by the public in general, and given that when someone is making a choice that they often don't realize is a bad choice or they're not informed enough to make meaningful choice, we don't think that stripping them them off that autonomy in that way, especially when they're broader societal and beneficial social impacts that come from banning homeopathy as well as economic impacts, we don't think it's stripping them from a meaningful use of their bodily autonomy, and because of that we think that we should ban homeopathy.
We should abolish the american jobs act because at the end of the day it doesn't do nearly enough to actually fix the problems that are excedent society and it's just a waste of political capital and it takes away from the ability to actually pass more effective legislation. So let's break all these kinds of things down. It's important to keep in mind that in order to pass some kind of broad legislation, especially one in which a lot of money is going to be spent, it's very very difficult to do so. By and large there is an overwhelming political resistance, whether it's by republicans or wealthier interests like wealthy people in the society who are worried that they're going to have to be taxed more. There's an overwhelming uphill battle when it comes to large public spending especially on things that aren't the military which the americans job backs is. So what this results in is that passing any kind of legislation at all on the matter is already going to waste a lot of your political capital and it's going to mean that it's not able to actually fix all that much. So that's important because it means that if you're going to be passing legislation at all in this matter you should be making sure that it's one that effectively actually solves the problem. I don't think that the american jobs act does nearly enough. Keep in mind that we exist in the nation with absolutely abysmal crumbling infrastructure old public old acts like old and outdated things like public utilities and energy grids, roads are in disrepair, railroads are by and large ineffective means of travel and things like that. Public education is not all that great, pay and wages are strongly contrasted in things like that. And all of these things are incredibly important because when you're talking about legislation that is supposed to actually help with employment in america in terms of a crisis, these are problems that you have to solve and make sure you're actually solving them. So this means that things that should have happened are more money should have been spent on infrastructure projects, it should have been done so in a more expansive way, more money should have been spent on things like worker protections, worker wage protections, unemployment protections, things like that. Things that would actually help improve the lives of american workers and the like. And I think that it is by doing those things you would actually see more tangible positive impacts that policy. You would first see a whole lot more people actually getting employed, a whole lot more people actually being benefiting from these things and not just on the individual level, but you will also see society benefit a whole lot more because you would actually be doing these things to a great enough degree that they would be doing more than just a drop in the bucket. They would actually be causing substantive change. And that's key because that's I think that the best way in which you actually make sure that the changes that you're passing are long lasting. And it is for all those reasons that we should abolish the american jobs act.
Bombing of hiroshima nagasaki were justified. So, we think that, what's important in this debate is to look at it in a comparative context, because obviously, it's sad and tragic that, thousands of innocent people died in order to prevent the continuation of a war, but, it's also important to recognize that, japan even though it was losing, was not at a point where it was likely to surrender. Military leadership have been warned about the possibility of such bombings, and still chose not to surrender. The hierarchy of japanese society didn't allow such surrender to happen. So, we think that, what is very likely is that these bombings hadn't had happened, the war would have gone on longer, more tragic things would have occurred, and while like, the counter factual is very difficult to conceptualize, we think that there are a few reasons under it why it's preferable that the bombings happened, and why, in that sense, they're justified. So, let's look at some of the tactics that were done in the war. Things like firebombing of japanese land that also killed innocent civilians, though didn't do it in the same kind of massive scale, we think that these things would've continue to happen, in a land invasion. We also think that, a land invasion of japan, rather than the bombings, would have led to the deaths of thousands of united of US soldiers, and as the united states, as the allied powers, we think that you have a foremost obligation to protect those soldiers, those people that, whether drafted of volunteered, are being forced to put their lives on the line, put their lives at risk in order to protect us from an obvious threat. So, why do we what are the reasons that we think make this a justice case? Firstly, the US needed the US needs to care for its own. The united states has an obligation, as a society, as a state, to protect the civilians that compose that state. While it's true that, there may be obligations to people outside of that state, your foremost obligation is to those within your state. That's, the tautology of your existence is to protect those of your own state. And given that this is the case, we think that it's preferable to do the thing that, on the calculus of war, insures that fewer of your soldiers die, even if it may mean to some civilians dying in japan. Secondly, we think that the calculus is one that means that, either way even with civilian deaths, this was a justified calculation, because the fire bombings would've continued, because the war of world war two was not some pretty thing, in which individual civilian rights were respected, but rather we think that a land invasion would've resulted in many US soldiers committing horrible crimes against the individuals of of japan, especially because there's an intense anger towards japan, because it had attacked the united states first. This is one of the few instances, in which US aggression is wholly justified, in the nature of self defense. So, given that in the long run, it's likely that, more japanese civilians would have died due to either, US soldiers actions, or the strategic planning of firebombing cities, in order to make it impossible for for japan to fight back, we think that this strategy is the one that led to the fewest on net deaths, and it also ensured that, the war was able to come to an end quickly, it ensured that the the japan wasn't completely taken out, which means it was capable of being rebuilt, and as we've seen, japan has been able to become a a massive power on the world stage. Finally, we want to recognize that, the united states gave warnings about what was going to happen. This wasn't a blind attack on japanese soil, but rather they dropped pamphlets unto the unto to the cities, in which civilians may have been targeted, they gave opportunity for people to leave. Yes, we recognize that this was a hard task to do, but on the net, on on the whole, we think that it's just clear that, these bombings allowed for fewer civilians to die, and allowed for the war, a war that was justified because of japanese aggression, to come to an end quicker. And for those reasons, we believe the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were justified.
We think that people have a right to the internet. In which we mean, we think the internet should be treated as a public good, the same way transportation is treated as a public good, the same way education is treated as a public good. The meaning of this is that the government needs to ensure internet access to everyone, other than of course exceptions like criminals behind bars et cetera. Most of the time, this will be done just by enabling a free market, some of the time it means intervention in the market either to prevent monopolies or to create a market where the free market is unable to do so due to profitability, this means the government would have to subsidize it, lastly it means, attempting at least to ensure it internationally, such as google's attempts to insure internet access globally. Two arguments we're gonna make. One is what is the criteria for a public good, and two, are, why and what rights require the internet in this day and age. So first, what is our criteria for public good? We think public good is a term that defines things that are necessary in order to facilitate basic human rights. So for example, you have a basic human right for safety, a public good in the form of police or military are then created in order to facilitate that safety, a government is responsible to maintain that police in order to maintain the security of the individuals. Transportation for example, you have a right for freedom of movement in an ever globalizing economy in which things are no longer walking distance from your home, that right is facilitated necessarily by the ability for motorized transportation and, as such, public transportation becomes a public good, where in, governments need to subsidize things like buses in order to enable people to act upon their basic rights. What do we think are the rights that require internet to be seen as a public good? The first, is freedom of speech. It used to be the case where the most basic form of speech, was going out into the street, standing on, you know, soapbox or whatever, and talking to people face to face. And the government wouldn't be allowed to limit that and in fact would need to facilitate that if that were ever necessary. However today's day and age, most public discourse happens over the internet. Political arguments happen not in the streets, but on facebook, and through email and various internet forums. In order to enable participation in the most basic form of freedom of speech, you need the internet, this means, that expression on the internet is not an uplifted version of expression, but rather, the bread and butter of expression at the point at which most public discourse happens there. So we think for freedom of speech, you require the internet as a public good. Secondly, we think equality of opportunity requires the internet as a public good. A, by education, in the fact that most education is better available, or uniquely available on the internet. You can get books on the internet, you can get wikipedia on the internet, and in fact a world of education is open to you. Crucially, equality of opportunity means that, since this is open to many people, it is crucial to make sure that it's open to all people. Secondly, in the aspect of business. Not only do many jobs require you have internet access in order to work, but in order to find a job in the first place, most companies now publicize their wanted ad only on the internet. So in order to gain equality of opportunity both in education and in business, internet is necessary in order to facilitate this. So because internet meets the criteria for a public good, it is about time governments start seeing it as such. Please propose.
We should close the guantanamo bay detention camp, but we're going to go even beyond that and say that the US should leave guantanamo bay and give the entire naval base back to cuba. So, a few reasons why this is true. First: guantanamo bay rightfully belongs to cuba and the united states stole it from them wrongfully in the twentieth century. We see that, ultimately, the cuban government never consented to having our naval base there and that the US has maintained this through the use of force, not anything actually legitimate. We think that this is pretty clearly just theft from the people of cuba. We've taken over this territory and refused to give it back, even though we acquired it through legal colonial enterprise. We think that we need to close the base because, ultimately, it's unjust for the united states to take advantage of other countries just because they're weak. Ultimately, we're able to hold on to gitmo because the cubans can't make us leave, but we think that this is unjust, that the weak shouldn't have to fear the strong, and that it's wrong for the US to take advantage of our power over cuba. But as a second sort of sub-argument to this, I'll point out that cuba today is not what it was fifty years ago. The country is increasingly liberalizing and opening itself up to the rest of the world. We've seen that it's normalized trade with the US, for instance, and we think that we should reward this good behavior by returning the naval base. We think that maybe there was a case to be made for holding on to it when cuba was one of our enemies fifty years ago, but that's simply not the case anymore, and there's no reason to keep this territory. Secondly, we think that we need to close down guantanamo bay in order to end the torture camp that's been run there for decades now. It's illegal to hold and torture people in the united states proper which is why it's being done at this naval base in cuba. So we think that by closing the base, you make it more difficult for the CIA torture program and other torture programs to continue, you take away the legal fiction that made it possible for them to claim they weren't doing anything wrong. And obviously, the torture camp needs to be closed. Tormenting people is contrary to the US values of human dignity and human rights and on top of that, it's ineffective. Torturing people leads them to tell you what you want to hear, it doesn't actually give you good information. So this program needs to end and for that reason, we should close guantanamo bay. But our last argument is about optics. We think that the US needs to consider its image abroad. Right now, much of our soft power as a country is derived from being the leader of the so-called free world. But when you run what amounts to a giant prison camp in cuba and the cubans tell everyone all around the world about how awful it is, we think that that really undermines your ability to drive soft power from that claim. So look, even if you don't buy the other claims in this round about how the land really belongs to cuba or about how the torture program doesn't work, this is still enough for us to win. Because if you think it's important that the US is able to spread democracy globally, that the US is able to exert itself through soft power rather than hard power, then you should want to close guantanamo bay, because hypocrisy only empowers the people who want to see you fail. The existence of gitmo gives people like vladimir putin ammunition to talk about how the US only cares about human rights when it suits us. If we really want to spread human rights globally, if we really want to spread democracy, then we need to walk the walk as well as talk the talk. That means closing down guantanamo bay. And on top of that, things like the US ability to provide trade, to invest in other countries, are also influenced by our soft power. If we become less ideologically appealing than other countries because we're seen to be lying or doing whatever we want regardless of what the right thing is, then ultimately we're going to lose out on trade deals, lose out on allies, and that does tremendous harm to our ability to do business abroad. So for these reasons, we should close the guantanamo bay detention camp. Thank you.
We should subsidize journalism, because journalism, the process of of purveying this accurate accurate quality information is absolutely vital to a functioning democracy, and such journalism of good quality is dying out. So, those are going to be the things I'm going to discuss. But first, let's talk a little bit about the model, about what exactly subsidizing journalists going to look like. The way, in which I foresee this being played out, is the government is essentially going to give out grants to am journalist companies am, so could be like, examples could be something like the sun sentinel in florida, am probably not the washington post or the new york times maybe, because I foresee this being used primarily as need based grants, for more local industries or state industries, that are struggling or struggling meet ends meet arm more so. That's where I think the money should be going. So let's first start by talking about why journalism is dying out, and then talking about why this death is such a big problem, and about why the subsidies are going to be very good and important. So, obviously, am it's incredibly difficult for journalists companies to make money these days, and journalists in general to make money these days, and the reason for that is because you can access most things on the internet for free, even if you try to instead of pay having to pay a subscription, you could still have things like an ad blocker, so you can't really profit as a journalist company that way anyway, and it's also often times more convenient for customers and consumers, because instead of having to pay a blanket prescription for all subscription for all the content, you can be more selective and only read the things he wants read online. So, this is obviously particularly bad for local news, and am not nationalist news in nature. But, this presents a very big problem as far as the way in which it's being replaced, and how it does for journalism. So, obviously the media and journalism are incredibly important to democracy. There's a reason why freedom of press is a protected first amendment right in the US constitution, because ultimately, everything that's involved in our decisions is reliant on information: when we're deciding on conclusions, when we're deciding on our beliefs, all of these things can, all of our values, and all the things that we think can only be generated based on the experiences we have in the world, and this this could include both our lived experiences, but in a lot of cases, this is based on the things that we read, or the things that we here about, or have as an academic source of discussion, or official source of discussion. So, this is very important because, in order for there for you to have actually truly like educated beliefs, it's necessary for you to be looking at sources that are of good quality. Am and that's not good, because when you have traditional journalism, the journalism that is now dying out, it meets this bar in most cases, maybe not fox news, but most cases you have extensive vetting in editing, you have integrity to make sure that it is actually factually true, am, more limited misrepresentation of facts, things like that. But, the problem is that when you see the the void, that we see being filled out, is overwhelmingly things like fake news that is being pushed out on facebook, am things like that. For example, like hillary clinton has killed like eight people, and was laughing about it afterwards, nonsense like that can get ten million clicks on facebook, because of the way those algorithms work. And this is the kind of news it's replacing. And it's replacing it effectively, because it's much more sensationalist in nature. But, this creates a society in which you're having much less discourse much less founded in fact, so this is how you get such extreme positions on the right wing , positions that are such like unfounded in education or fact, or reality. So, this is something that's very bad, and this is also particularly bad not just for the national level, based on those kinds of phenomenons I talked about, but it also limits engagement with the local level, and it makes it so that it's harder to have am good and accurate quality news reporting, on things that happen on the local level, which is quite bad, given that a whole lot of governing, that impacts your day to day life, happens on a local level. So, for all those reasons we should subsidize journalism.
I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion, that we should abolish affirmative action. I think the definition of affirmative action is pretty straightforward, in that this is programs that, either in universities or corporations or whatever, promote people who are of historically oppressed classes in the united states. Maybe this is like affirmative action program for like women in hiring, for like african americans, so on so forth, in generally, most like racial minorities this will probably apply to. So, three independent points on this. First, that there are often places people who are unqualified for the position, in a way that hurts both the institution at which they hired, and the person who is being the recipient of the affirmative action. Second, that it distracts from more politically salient solutions to systemic inequality, and thirdly, the backlash that it generates. On the first independent point, regarding lack of qualifications. So we think that, generally speaking, these are going to be people who are put into these positions, that are comparatively less qualified than others, this is almost inherently true, given that if they were equally qualified, or more qualified, they would probably be higher to the traditional process. I think there instances of hiring discrimination, that might like chew away the edges of this for them, but for the most part, like blatant hiring discrimination is something that can be legally prosecuted. So, how does this harm individuals involved in the process then? So first, at the corporate or university level, it harms them insofar as they have applicants at their doors, that are just like less qualified, less capable of doing their jobs. That creates inefficiencies within the corporation. But secondly, it harms the beneficiary three ways: first, on campus discrimination. Things like hate crimes are more frequent for people that are beneficiaries of affirmative action, insofar as the narrative surrounding their acceptance is that they did not deserve it. That in turn leads to a lot of discrimination, that would not occur in the world where they did not receive that affirmative action, and in return, means more suffering. Second is the financial burden it places on these individuals, that, again when we're talking about universities, tuition is often quite high at the more prestigious universities, that affirmative action would generally have to apply to, because generally speaking, like state, universities don't have to worry about meeting these types of quotas. And third, the high dropout rate, or firing rate in terms of corporations, means that generally the so called benefits of these programs aren't even actualized, right? Like a lot of like, like a recipients of affirmative action are disproportionately more likely to drop out, specifically because they did not receive like the quality of early education, that was necessary to make them capable of the course load and the work burden, that is intrinsic to the place that they end up going. So, as a result of that that they are much more likely to drop out. So, second independent point is that it distracts from reforming primary school education, from like a political standpoint. So in america, the black white testing gap, that is like the testing gap that exists between like african americans and white children, is something that originates around second grade, that is to say in like kindergarten and first grade generally, when you test people, there is like no statistically significant difference based on race. As you get older however, that gap begins to widen, because a disproportionate accesses to access to resources like tutors, and other things that are generally financially motivated, but also somewhat intrinsic to like the way in which like we value like schools in like historically black neighborhoods, and things like that. That's a problem that is a that is like actually possible to tackle, right? Because when we just sort of take these children, who are historically disadvantaged by their primary education, and shove them into colleges expecting that to be the fix all, that doesn't work right? Like we need to address these things in the most basic level, and when you have affirmative action programs that are satiating the liberals who support them, you generally don't get the more important reform at the basic level, that actually creates the problem in the first place. Third independent point is backlash, that generally this is a galvanizing issue for like, far right groups, and like especially groups that are motivated by racial hatred. We think that, generally, this is a bad thing, because this is something that is extremely easy to demonize, and so far it is like externally just like looks like an unfair thing to do, and as a result of that, we think there are like exogenous harms that come from this, as a result of the fact that you are driving people to engage in hateful politics, because you are giving them like, this easy thing to straw man. Proud to propose.
Immigration to the united states brings more good than harm for two big reasons: first, it brings a lot of good to americans and this, from a self interested perspective, it's good for our economy in that it's good for jobs, it's good for the economy. And secondarily, it's good because it's the moral thing to do. It's just the right thing to do as a liberal society, a democratic society in which we just have more, are fortunate enough to have more. So, let's start by talking about self interest. And I think this one is pretty clear. Immigration is incredibly good for the US economy it provides a boost to the amount of people in the workforce, it provides a boost to consumption. This is why a lot of like economists are oftentimes very concerned with population growth. Because it's something that's just important to the like healthy maintenance of an economy and this is something that is important to all americans. It's important to all americans to make sure that the economy stays strong. Additionally I think that they're also helpful in that in the jobs that they are able to provide. I think that they're helpful in the fact that they often do jobs that americans don't wanna do and that this means that these jobs, which are still important, are getting done. And the final, the third and final reason why I think that it's good for americans though is that I think it's good from a cultural perspective. I think that when you have like a diversity of people that you're encountering on a day to day basis when you're experiencing different cultures whether it's through food or friendships or celebrations, I think that in a lot of ways this leads to a more like enriching understanding of the world and a more enriching life in general, and more enjoyable one too at that. So now that now going on to the second argument: the argument about how this is simply just the moral thing to do. So, it's important to understand that immigration is something that is incredibly difficult to do. It's difficult in that it's oftentimes just financially difficult it's difficult to get the money to do that, to just pack up and go somewhere else, try to get a new life. It's difficult emotionally, you're oftentimes leaving down what you've been most comfortable with your whole life, you could be leaving behind family members, close friendships, to go somewhere possibly very far away and finally it's also bad just logistically. It's difficult to make the move, it's difficult to maybe learn a new language, learn a new culture. It's very difficult to be an immigrant. So, all of this should be taken into consideration when we want to ask this question. If it's so hard why do people do it? And I think the reason people do it is because they feel a need to do that. Whether it's a security need in some circumstances, people come from countries that are ravaged by war or violence and they fleet to places like united states for safety and security. There is also the possibility of them fleeting from poverty and trying to get more economic prosperity in somewhere like america. Whatever their reasons may be, given how hard it is to emigrate, we should recognize that people don't do this just on a whim and that people are trying to come out of oftentimes very bad situations. And when somebody is trying to come to america, if we're a country that wants to actually just help people, if we're a country that wants to do the right thing, and we should bring allow immigrants to come in. So for all those reasons very proud to propose this motion.
Slum tourism does more harm than good, because at the end of the day, it doesn't help anything, but it makes people think they're helping, which means they're less likely to do things that are actually helpful. So, let's break that down. First, by why slum tourism doesn't actually help anything. The first reason for this is an obvious one: just visiting a slum, or touring a slum, doesn't actually help ameliorate the obvious hardships that exists there. Being aware of a problem doesn't actually mean that you're taking action to help that problem. If you make things like donations, maybe that would be one thing, but oftentimes, just being aware of a problem, or simply going to a problem, that doesn't really have any actual impact on it. But, additionally, there's oftentimes only limited efficacy that comes from these kinds of things anyway. So, even if you go there, and you do you basic volunteer work, or basic donations, that doesn't actually make any kind of meaningful dent in the much more structural problems, that are the reason why slums exist in the first place. But, the additional thing I want to talk about this, is about this is oftentimes can be quite demeaning to people, because in a lot of ways it's essentially almost, putting up the hardships and struggles that people face as, like, this tourist attraction. It's, in a lot of ways, almost strikes as zoo-like, and it's it's incredibly messed up in a whole lot of ways, because it essentially commodified, it allows people to, it allows like corporate corporations and tourism industry to profit off of that. People who make the like tacky souvenirs to ' prof ' off these kinds of things, ' prof ' off the legitimate struggles those people are facing. That's something that's incredibly messed up, and I often don't think that the slum tourism industry actually helps the people, that are suffering all of that anywhere near the amount that it should. The next reason, why slum tourism does more harm than good though, is because it results in an illusion of solvency. So, when people think that they are doing good, there's a very natural response, un and that natural response is to first, not really push for change in policies, because if you think that you're already doing good, then you're not necessarily going to be, as likely to be, an ardent defender of things like, problematic trade policies, or economically are like, our hard imperialist policies, like the way in which the war on drugs has ravaged the whole lot of places in south america, or or diamond trades, or like valuable mineral trades in places in africa. All of these kinds of things, or oil in other parts of the world, like all of these are examples of the fact that, there's oftentimes incredibly problematic policies that exist, or government irresponsibility, like the US government propping up dictators if they're advantageous to them. All of these are oftentimes, like, structural reasons why slums exists in the first place, and, if you think that you're doing good in your own way that's not actually all that helpful, you're not supporting ways that, are going to be a whole lot more helpful, to actually ameliorating those problems. So, that's, it makes you more close minded, which is incredibly bad, but, the additional thing is that, I think that ultimately this is just a cover, and it's a cover to deflect the blame that you feel on yourself, for the daily immoralities that you put up, or the contributions that you make, to the reason why these people are in slums in the first place. Whether it's the clothes that you're probably wearing, or the phones that you're probably using, or the coffee that you're probably drinking, all of those can likely be source to rather unhealthy, unsafe, and unsavory working conditions, and this is a big problem, because, in a lot of ways, the fact that we're willing to accept these things of in the name of like, these products, in the name of like cheap labor, we're oftentimes only contributing to the problems that exist there, and it's for all of those reasons that, slum tourism does more harm.
We should further exploit natural gas. So by this we mean to say that western countries should prioritize adopting natural gas to replace coal and oil based power plants and the developing countries should build natural gas power plants rather than coal plants. So we think that whenever there's a trade off between natural gas and another fossil fuel or traditional fuel source, that we ought prioritize natural gas. Were agnostic about whether this would trade off with things like nuclear power, we're really more focused here on coal and oil. Our first argument is that this is a stepping stone to a cleaner world. Natural gas has many fewer harmful emissions than coal in particular, but also oil as well. We think that not only should natural gas be used to things power plants for cities, but that other countries should follow india's lead and widely adopt liquid natural gas as a way to power cars, buses and other vehicles. In new delhi for instance all of the public buses run on liquid natural gas which releases much less pollution and smog than corresponding amounts of gasoline would. Lately some american cities like los angeles have begun to adopt the same principle in order to fight smog. We think that anything that we can do that will cut down on emissions of fossil or other of greenhouse gases, pardon me, would ultimately be good for the environment and reduce climate change. But it's also good for the people who live in these cities. Los angeles is famous for its smog for instance but it's already been cut back significantly, in part by efforts to adopt natural gas in place of traditional petroleum. And in new delhi I'm told that it's made a very large difference as well since there are so many public buses on the street. Ultimately, while natural gas isn't perfect and it would be nice if everyone could use nuclear power instead, the technology to adopt it is very cheap and already extent and that makes it more accessible than other types of energy, for developing countries in particular, and more palatable to voters and politicians in developed countries. So we think that this is an excellent alternative to jumping straight to renewable energies. Our second argument is that we think that the use of natural gas will promote trade and stability. One of the most important reasons why there hasn't been another major global conflict since world war two is because the entire world is caught up in trade with one another and everyone's economy depends on everyone else's. Keeping this international system stable requires keeping russia as an important player in the international system. Unfortunately, russia is a petrol state. Its main exports are oil and natural gas. Oil use is declining in many western countries and ultimately is going to peak in the next hundred years or so. We worry that in the future russia will be less committed to international peace if its major export is no longer a source of stability for the country, but rather a potential harm. If we rely on natural gas instead though then russia will build more pipelines to its neighbors and be more connected to europe, china and other countries than it is right now. We think that this is likely to lead to greater peace in the long term between other countries and russia. And not to put all the blame on them either. We think that if european countries are dependent on russian natural gas, that they'll have to behave in a more respectful and appropriate way towards russia. Moreover, we think that for many middle eastern countries, whose economies are going to collapse once oil goes away, natural gas is a stepping stone to a more sustainable economy. This gives these countries a second opportunity to have massive energy exports that they can invest into sovereign wealth funds or diversifying their economies so that once the natural gas and oil are gone their people won't be returned to the destitution that existed in countries like the emirates work fossil fuels were discovered. So because it's a stepping stone to a cleaner earth and because it promotes trade and stability we should further exploit natural gas. Thank you.
We should ban racial profiling. Racial profiling is the process of policing, in which individuals are either arrested, primarily because, or as a certain factor, because of the race that they are. , so, we think that this is blatantly discriminatory, and that it is ultimately ineffective in doing the job of policing, and because of that, we should ban racial profiling. So, firstly, why it's discriminatory? We think that, law exists to judge people on individual cases, that law in the trial process in democracies exists to ensure that people had their fair chance at freedom, and to ensure that they have a presumption of innocence when they go into a courtroom. We think, in order for this presumption of innocence to have any merit at all, in the way that, police choose to observe and to act around people within the polity, there needs to be a presumption of innocence there as well, that there needs to be a certain level of respect and dignity given to all people within our society, and that even when someone isn't in the courtroom, you should always have a presumption of innocence, as a public official, and certainly as a police officer. Racial profiling skews that dramatically. It means that you're going to use statistics to say that, this person is less likely to be innocent than someone of a different race. And in doing so, you strip them of that presumption of innocence, and their basic human decency, when they're walking around in our society, when they're participating in our society . And furthermore, this doesn't have any sort of effect on criminality. Race does not genuinely, through the fact that it is race, dictate criminality. There's nothing about being of a certain race that makes you propensity eh that gives you a higher propensity to commit crimes, even if statistics show that there are certain clusters in certain races, that per capita are more likely to be incarcerated, but I'll get to this in a second. So, why does racial profiling cause tangible harms in the communities that are being policed? Well, one: it makes these communities feel otherise. When this process is used systemically within police departments, it it sends of passage from public officials, from the law, it sends the message, that we believe that you are a criminal race, or you are a more likely to be criminal person, and we this make people feel like victims in their own communities. When they feel like victims in their own communities, there's more likely to be tension between police, which means that police efforts between police and communities, which means that, the effort of policing in the first place becomes dramatically more difficult, it's less likely to get community involvement in activity, in participation, in solving crimes, in reporting crimes, in taking care of one's own, and in this sense we think that racial profiling only serves to undermine the purpose of policing. But secondly, we think that racial profiling is also just ineffective. Racial profiling and crime statistics come out of a history of racial discrimination. In a time in which which laws were modeled in order to directly target people of a particular race, such as in the united states, when the war on drugs started, as a nixon administrator, and the nixon administration said: it was the criminalization of certain drugs was done, directly to harm minorities, to harm people of color, to ensure they were incarcerated. Directly after the end of colonialism, systems were put in place by colonial powers to ensure that they still had the labor, that they previously had from the colonial system, through laws and policing that targeted minority groups. That's why statistics exist in the way they do, and these things have a compounding effect. When parents are taken away from children, put in jail, and aren't able to earn money, children are dramatically more likely to end up in those cycles, if for no other reason than they have nowhere to turn, but the desperation of committing crimes, or because they grow up in an environment where that becomes normalized. But, it's not because of who they are, and we don't think that the statistics mean that people are more criminal, it's just a sign of the hardship that they go through in society. And because of this, we don't think that these statistics are any meaningful should have any meaningful impact on how we police. If anything, it should have a meaningful impact in how we choose to give social goods, and social needs, to to specific communities of people. And because of this, we believe that we should ban racial profiling.
We should further exploit wind power. What we mean by furthering the exploiting wind power is firstly, we think we should have government subsidize the production and signs behind developing the technologies for wind power. Secondly, we would provide incentives for the average corporation or the average person to invest in wind power, to get power through wind power corporations and thirdly, we would like to have a world in which the norm is that in which wind power is more prominent. So we don't we're not gonna be talking specifically about policy but generally about the benefits of wind power in a comparative sense with fossil fuels and other types of clean energy. So firstly, we think in any sort of debate about clean energy the most important thing at stake is global warming. Recognize that we are at a point in which we've done so much damage to our environment through the industrialization of the globe, that we are a tipping point where global temperatures will rise by two to four degrees celsius annually over the course of over the course of several hundred of the course about a hundred years in a way that will cause global global ice caps to melt, will cause higher sea temperatures which will lead to increased natural disasters and increased veracity of those natural disasters such as more hurricanes, stronger hurricanes, things like that. It leads to droughts which make people, especially those that are the most vulnerable with least food security, incredibly likely to starve because they simply cannot continue to have the same planting patterns that they have had for hundreds of years but rather they have to develop entirely new planting patterns or the rain simply will not come in the way it needs to for these people to be fed and we're also at a point at which it's almost going to be irreversible soon. Scientists say that if we don't have drastic change in the next five years in the very near future we will be at a point in which all the changes because of the greenhouse effect and all the changes that have been caused by trapping more carbon dioxide and more heat our atmosphere, if we don't do something now we are going to be at a point which the chain reactions of our actions in the last hundred years are not going to be reversed and at the and at that that point we're creating harm not just for ourselves but for our children, our grandchildren, the people that will have no choice about coming into this world but through our own desires will come into existence, through our own choices, and we are dooming them into a world in which they will have to lead harder lives in which the globe will not be livable at the same way that it is now, in which we will ruin the natural environment that our ancestors for hundreds of years passed down on to us and allowed us to live and thrive. We think we have an obligation to those people to change the way that we are behaving now. So with all that in mind, why wind power? Well firstly, wind power is clean and it is renewable. You can't run out of the wind from having things like wind farms in the middle of the sea in which wind production is pretty much constant and also there's no outlying negative harms. Your not having any sort of a mission or pollution that comes from this which means wind power is almost entirely a clean energy. We also think that it's at a point in which the costs are still higher than fossil fuels and so things like further exploiting it are likely to drive down those cost. Things like subsidizing the use and production of technologies are likely to drive down the costs of wind power in the future. We also think that compared to other clean energy resources wind power is more versatile than things like solar because it's not there's no time of day when wind power simply isn't going to work and it's more versatile than things like nuclear because it simply safer and we have a better understanding of how it can be used and how it can be exploited. So because global warming is so crucial and wind power as a common sense solution is a clean energy that will be useful, we think we should further exploit wind power.
We should ban alternative medicine. So by alternative medicine, I wanna be really clear what we are talking about. These are practices that people claim are able to cure illnesses but that are either disproven or unproven or impossible to prove that they actually have these effects. So, many alternative medicines are going to be things like traditional folk remedies, etcetera, but some of them are more exotic, things like homeopathy or crystals or cupping, that don't actually have any positive effect but that people still spend lots of money on. So we have three arguments for you today. The first is about why the state ought step in and intervene to prevent people from consuming alternative medicines. The first point is that there are third-party harms to people choosing to use third-party alternative medicine. If you, for instance, choose to use crystal magic to treat your pneumonia rather than using actual medicines prescribed by a doctor, then you're much more likely to spread that illness. We see that while infectious disease may not be a tremendous concern for the types of healthy young people who probably do a lot of debating in college, that is a real concern for young children and the elderly. These are groups which need our consideration when we think about these communicable illnesses because it's much more serious for an eighty-year-old or a three-year-old to get pneumonia than you or I. We might be in bed for a few days. They could die. So we need to take this very seriously. We think that that point that there is a clear third-party harm to people choosing to use alternative medicine because they spread these illness. And we think that these are the type of diseases that people are most likely to use alternative medicine for, things that are fairly serious, like the flu or pneumonia, but not so serious that they would put people in the hospital at which point, presumably, they would receive real treatment. The second time when the state should intervene, and this is very clear for our side, is when there's an asymmetry of information. What do we mean by this? The big businesses that produce these alternative drugs, because don't let the other team tell you that it's grandma in her kitchen whipping up some old traditional remedies, this is a big industry. These big companies know full well that their remedies don't work. If they did work, then these companies would file patents and make a lot more money selling them to health insurance companies or national health, etcetera. They don't work, and they know they don't work, but they're selling them to people anyway and, basically, lying to tell them that they do work. We think that at this point the government, which has access to the information that it doesn't work, should intervene to protect the common consumers, who aren't educated enough to make this decision for themselves because they're not doctors, they're not attorneys, they don't know whether or not these drugs actually work or whether these companies are lying. So at the end of the day, we think that the state should intervene. Our second argument is about public health. We think that if people went to their family doctor and got real medicine, instead of relying on these alternative remedies, that they would be sick less often. This would mean that they spread fewer illnesses, remember what I said earlier, but also that they would miss less work, miss less school, ultimately be more productive members of society. We also think that because people tend to get more sick if they don't receive treatment that more people probably go to the hospital or consume a lot of expensive resources that take up national health money when they use this alternative medicine to begin with. Our third argument is that this would stop poaching. This might seem a little strange, but remember that the one big reason why tigers, rhinos and other elephants elephants and other animals are being poached is because traditional medicine in some countries requires body parts from these animals for the cures. So rhino horn, for instance, might be seen as a cure for impotence in some cultures. If we shut down this market, it's already true that poaching is illegal. But if we prevented people from even purchasing alternative medicines, then we think more people would stop believing in alternative medicine, since we could run education campaigns, etcetera to build support for the government action, and this would reduce demand for poached animals, which would ultimately lead to less poaching. So for these three reasons, we think that we should ban alternative medicine. Thank you.
We should not subsidize agriculture. So, in the status quo in many countries such as the united states, the government gives huge amounts of money to farms and other agricultural businesses to subsidize their production of food. We have two big arguments why we think this shouldn't go on. The first is that it encourages over production. So, recognize that if you are paid to produce, whether or not anyone is consuming your products, then ultimately, your incentives are completely divorced from the market. So right now, dairy farmers in the united states, for instance, produce far more milk than anybody is able to drink before it spoils. So we see that there's lots of milk going to waste, but farmers continue to produce it anyway. The net effect of these subsidies, is that the federal government is buying milk to pour down the drain. We just don't think this makes any sense to use of limited government funds, to use it to support people producing milk that nobody wants. And this is the outcome of subsidies, they create inefficiencies in the market that would be solved otherwise, because without subsidies, there would be fewer dairy farmers and there will be less milk produced and that milk would be more, like, similar to the actual demand for milk in around the world. But we also tell you that this harms other farmers abroad. In particular, if a country with a huge agricultural base like the united states or china has agricultural subsidies, then they flood global markets with really cheap goods and farmers elsewhere can't compete. The reason why people in a lot of sub saharan african countries are eating american corn instead of grain grown in their own country, is that the US taxpayers are heavily subsidizing corn production in the united states, so it's so much cheaper than corn produced and sold according to an actual free market in other countries, that they can never compete, and domestic farmers in those countries are greatly harmed by this, and can't support themselves and can't continue their business. We think that this is harmful because, since many countries promote free trade, broadly speaking we think that subsidies undermine that, and make it more difficult to have free trade across borders. Our second argument is that we think this is an abuse of government power. So basically what happens when you have agricultural subsidies, is you take tax money from low income people, and give it to very wealthy farmers. Recognize that farming today is not mom and pop on some farm out in the midwest growing a little bit of corn. It's huge multi billion dollar industry with massive companies that actually control huge swathes of farmland. So we think that this is basically transferring money from low income people to the very wealthy people who actually own those companies and are taking all of the profits. We think that that's also really harmful because, when things go bad because these companies are mismanaged, they can get away with it from subsidies, so the profits are all private and the risk is all public. We think that that's fundamentally unfair to the americans who can't keep that money for themselves to spend it on their own needs, or to invest it as they see fit. We also think that it's unfair for the government to pick favorites. Basically, we think it's unjust that agricultural businesses get subsidies and other businesses don't. Now, farmers might say that they're the most important people in society, but I bet doctors say that too, so why do we subsidize agriculture and not other industries more heavily, or why do we subsidize agriculture and expect certain other industries like the automotive industry to function in a more free market? We think that you're effectively picking winners and losers here, and all companies are in a certain amount of direct competition because, if they're publicly owned they're all competing for people to buy their stocks, and to raise capital, so we think that there are real harms to other companies, because we have these heavy agricultural subsidies. But the last point that I'd like to make, is that I think that it forces individuals to buy products that they might not want to support. This is especially true because the agricultural industry is so controversial. If you think about how many people around the world choose not to eat meat because they think it's unethical, we think that that's a huge amount of people, but subsidies force them to support the meat industry because if something goes wrong in the industry, the difference is made up for by the government stepping in with subsidies, so you're basically making people purchase a good that they think is unethical against their will, and we don't think that should be the role of government. So we should not subsidize agriculture because it encourages market inefficiency and because it's a misuse of government power. Thank you.
We should subsidize distance education because it ensures more access to education and that's incredibly important. So the first way in which it ensures more access is just by making the literal act of going to school a whole lot easier which is great. It makes it a whole lot easier because first right now there's oftentimes a real concentration of schools in specific locations that may not be accessible for a whole lot of people. Like let's say that you live in a developing country you're probably not going to be able to go to some college in the united states and maybe it's not possible for you to go to the couple of colleges that exist in like a big cities or things like that. Additionally but it's oftentimes easier to get access it's oftentimes pretty comparatively easy to get access to say the internet. But this is even true in other kinds of contexts like for example schools tend to concentrate in america a most of the elite schools tend to concentrate in the like northeast area. So it's increased costs of going to college there if you don't already live near the area. Additionally there's a time problem. A lot of people have jobs a lot of people have other kinds of obligations maybe people have to take care of family members and they can't really leave home there's a whole other kind there's a whole slew of reasons why people may not have the time to get involved in a traditional education setting. Maybe not even go consistently to night school. Distance learning allows you to learn at your own pace oftentimes it allows you to learn in a more customized fashion which is incredibly good. But it also increases access in terms of money in terms of financial costs and this is obvious. College is incredibly expensive. You can spend tens of thousands of dollars on tuition in a ton of colleges a lot of this ends up happening going to student loans which is pretty bad for a whole lot of people. A lot of people may not have the credit to afford it to get access to student loans. A lot of people may not be able to afford the interest rates. A lot of people don't think they're going to realistically make enough money post graduation to pay off student loans. A lot of people are just freaked out of the about the idea of borrowing like tens and tens of thousands of dollars before they even start their life off. Those are pretty reasonable things and reasons why it ultimately discourages people from getting an education. And ultimately that's the worst outcome and it's the worst outcome because a less less education means that you're probably going to have lower career earnings it means that the workforce is less educated and your workers are less skilled. There's less innovation and creation. There's less economic growth there's a whole lot of reasons why you want to encourage economic why you want to encourage education. But additionally distance learning is also something that can be uniquely helped by subsidies. And it can be helped by subsidies because right now there's already a a large like demand that's being met for traditional colleges like there's no real shortage of traditional colleges. But there is a real shortage of quality alternative options. Obviously there's some alternate in the status quo like there's coursera there's like harvard open course and things like that. But these things are oftentimes limited and they're going to stay limited because there's less of a demand for them and less economies of scale for them and all these things can be corrected if you have more subsidies so for all those reasons you should subsidize distance education.
We should fight urbanization. By this we mean that countries, particularly developing countries, should introduce policies which discourage people from leaving rural areas to move to urban ones. Three arguments for why we think this is the case. The first is that we think that urbanization undermines traditional cultures. Many people's religion, language, culture, and way of life are tied to the place that they live. If they uproot themselves and move to the capital or another large city, we think that they're likely to lose that culture. In other words, urbanization undermines the little differences that provide diversity to a country and force people to assimilate to one urban culture in order to succeed. If you think about the philippines, there are many indigenous languages to this country. It has a lot of diversity in that way. But almost everybody who moves to major cities, like manila, ends up speaking tagalog, the national language. So we see that other minority languages are going extinct, that people aren't continuing to practice their ancient customs, and that ultimately these ways of life are probably going to go away. We think those things probably have aesthetic value and that diversity is a good in and of itself, but also we think it's unfortunate that the cultures that are being pushed on to people are often those that were put into place in urban areas by colonists, and that you see a continuing instance of more dominant cultures replacing subservient cultures, due to colonial relations. Our second argument is about why we think the type of organization that's largely going on today is not desirable. Most people moving to cities today are not moving to new york city or london. They're moving to cities like karachi or jakarta. And they're not living in the city center or the part that you see when we go visit from our nice western countries, they're moving into massive slums. So these people move into areas that don't have a lot of social services, the quality of the housing is very poor and often unsafe. There's no access to things like schools or public transit because these slums are often semi-illegal, because oftentimes people are discouraged from urbanizing and choose to move anyway, and therefore go into these slums. So, we think that what ultimately this does is put people into a situation that's much worse than the one that they came from. People think that they're going to move to the city and make it big and start a business but, ultimately, when they get there, they find out that that's impossible because the only place they can live are these slums. So people are being lied to and ending up in terrible living conditions. Some of the worst in the world are in cities like karachi or dhaka, where people just live in abject poverty, and there are no social services available to them. Our last point is that we think that this leads to poor development. So this is a big concern for developing countries, that if you have lots of urbanization, then it's very tempting to focus all of your wealth on making urban centers better, while letting rural centers lag behind. We see that to some extent, this is a problem in india. India, for instance, has separate minimum wages for urban and rural areas. But what this means is that there is an increasing gap between people in urban areas, who have primary and some secondary education, and people out in the villages in what are sometimes called tribal areas, who have basically no education and no access to services. And as the rate of urbanization increases, those rural people get left behind even more. We tell you that ultimately this is unacceptable because even if those people in rural areas are a smaller proportion of the population, we're still talking about millions of people who are being left behind by development, who aren't reaping the benefits of society. And we think that those people deserve an equal opportunity to benefit from society, that they're being denied if you have this organization, because all the development is going to end up concentrated in those cities. So in order to prevent the entire world from looking like the gap between mumbai and the poorest regions of inner india, we should fight urbanization. Thank you.
The motion for today's debate is that we should adopt teacher tenure reform. So a quick model. Currently teacher tenure occurs after three years of observation it makes it very difficult to fire that teacher and it provides them with like with essentially what is supposed to be more free reign in the classroom. So I think instead of these kinds of situation we would prefer to lengthen the probationary period of observation would make it easier to fire those with tenure and there'd be a better rating system and like regular job reviews regardless of your state of tenure. Moreover what matters most in this round is obviously going to be the impact on the children because the purpose of school is to educate children and if you're not being successful or reaching your full potential in that task then you are clearly not meeting your stated goal and there needs to be some kind of reform. Three main areas of clash. First on why current tenure creates complacency among teachers. Tenure makes it incredibly difficult to fire someone and if you're not going to have any kind of threat of losing your job or you don't or you feel overly secure in your job you no longer have an incentive to exert yourself more than you have to especially like people get very busy they start to have families and lives and at a certain point you're going to start sacrificing something. On our side of the house we think that sacrifice cannot beat your job given that influences so many small lives that are still developing. So we would prefer that teachers continue to have a professional reason to prove themselves and especially given that a lot of the time when you get tenure you are significantly older and you already occupy a position that potential younger and more enthusiastic teachers could fill. So you think that you actually have to justify your position to a point and if you're making it so that kids get a sub par education because you are complacent no longer feel the need to prove yourself to the board that is to announce your tenure then you need to be out of there and someone who is willing to put in that effort needs to be begin. Our second area of clash has to do with why tenure makes it very very unnecessarily difficult to remove incompetent teachers which hinders our school systems. So tender guarantees a level of security and it's incredibly difficult to breach that level it's hard to prove that there's a reasonable reason to fire them after they're tenured and it also becomes incredibly expensive given that you have to now negotiate with teachers' unions you have to get yourself a lawyer you oftentimes have to like cobble your parents into a situation and it means that most schools don't even bother doing so because if your choice is between a lengthy lawsuit over one teacher versus spending that money to fund other school activities or to pad the pockets of your of your board then you're not going to choose that lengthy difficult lawsuit especially since it often comes with a lot of bad publicity for your school in the eyes of the media. And you can be very easy to spin the school as a villain. So once we recognize that it's ridiculously difficult to fire a current member like was tenured we then have to discuss how this can be fixed and we think that reducing that barrier a little bit and allowing it to become easier to fire teachers creates a world in which we can actually get rid of those who are no longer making our school systems better and we don't think that it's going to be over used because it's always going to be difficult to start initiating firing someone. And there are a lot of protections that unions put in place regardless of tenure's existence and it's really difficult to get around those. Our third area of clash has to do with how tenure makes seniority the main deciding point when dismissing teachers on hard times. Especially recently we've seen that schools often find themselves economically strapped. They have to make cuts. The problem with tenure is that it changes the order in which we cut our teachers. It basically says that those who have been around for longer and have tenure are going to be cut last. This is incredibly problematic because those who need those jobs most and those who are likely to put the most effort in their jobs are actually people who are significantly younger and so we think that if we were able to switch this order it would be much better for children especially in situations in which your school is making a lot of cuts during economic hard times. For these reasons proud to propose.
The queen of england has the power to wage war, sign treaties, dissolve parliament, form governments, create lords. The royal family is above the law. In matters as trivial is the queen not needing a passport to travel, or not needing a license to drive a car, to matters far more serious such as the royal family being exempt for freedom of information requests. The system of monarchy is archaic and it's counter to our democratic values and that is why we we should abolish the monarchy. Let's talk about three main issues. First is the dangers of the line of succession and how that threatens democracy. Talk about the high cost of of the monarchy. We're gonna talk about the main question of what's the point of a monarchy? Why should we keep it around? So let's go back to the issue of the dangers of the line of of succession and the threat to democracy that exists. Queen elizabeth is quite a benevolent queen. She pays taxes although she is exempt officially as queen from doing so. She hasn't dissolved parliaments just for giggles. She seems to not unduly try to influence politics. But the nature of a monarchy is that we have no choice in who comes next. We know that there's a line of succession the cannot be tempered with. Charles is next in line and when queen elizabeth dies, no one can change that other than charles himself by abdicating. What if prince charles is not as benevolent a king and queen elizabeth was a queen? What if he decides to stop paying taxes? What if he decides to interfere more heavily in politics which he can do not only in britain, by the way, but in other countries like australia where he can dissolve parliament in the other countries where he is influence over politics. We think it's dangerous when you have a public figure who has so many powers even if they traditionally don't use them today, they have that power and when you have no when the people have no say in who comes next in line, they have no say in who is the next holder of these powers, we think that is a danger and a threat to democracy. We think that it doubles that threat to democracy when they are exempt from so many laws and they are exempt from very serious things like the freedom of information act. There is no transparency when it comes to the monarchy. There's no transparency in the way they deal with their money, with taxpayer money. There's no transparency in the way that they deal with things and they're above the law and exempt from the law and we think that that is dangerous to our democracy. It's simply incompatible with our way of life today, one that puts the people in charge. Second of all, we have the issue of the high cost of the royal family. There's a huge amount of money being spent on the royal family including salaries to the larger family not just the queen, to staff, official events, security, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Reforming the costs is extremely tricky because parliament is dependent on the good will of the royal family of the queen. Asking your boss to cut her own salary, or the salary of her family's, or her staff, or the number of events that she goes to, or her security, is not a particularly easy task for them to do. And there we have the question what's the point of the monarchy today? Yes it's a whimsical tradition but what's really the point? Why should we have a ceremonial head of state who isn't chosen by the people, who doesn't cost hundreds of millions of pounds to upkeep? There is no justification for it. Coupled with the high cost financially and the high cost to our democracy, we simply have to answer the question of what's the point with there is none anymore. There is no point to having a queen or a king who has powers that they're not supposed to be using too much, who hold extreme amounts by huge amounts of power for parliament in the in the united kingdom and yet they're not supposed to use it. We think that there's a big problem when you have this contradiction. We think that there's no point to keeping the monarchy around.
I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish the social security tax. Models pretty straightforward. We would just get rid of the social security system in general. I think we would faze this out. Obviously we wouldn't do it all overnight. So basically we would slowly decrease the tax and decrease the payouts until the system just sort of weaned off. So three independent points. First, the system is regressive. Right now payouts are tied to the previous income that you had over the course of your life. It's like you're average income or something like that. That's a problem because even in theory, that just means that people will get back what they paid into it. That basically rich people who had high incomes were taxed more and they get a bigger payout. But the problem is that the trajectory of this country over the last couple decades really has been widening inequality. That means that in practice, people pay the amount that they made over time but that gap over time widens. So what really happens then is that the money from poorer individuals trickles up into the richer individuals who get bigger cash outs later in their lives. Basically you were paying tax rates that were closer to each other at the beginning so in the comparative poor people were shouldering a larger part of the burden then they wound up getting out again in the comparative at the end of the cycle. That's a problem and it's fundamentally opposed to what the purpose of a tax system should be, especially one that is designed to support people who don't have a means of supporting themselves. Our second independent point is that the system is unsustainable and as a result doesn't meaningfully solve for the lack of older people to actually support themselves financially. Population growth over time means that there's never enough money in the system. Basically a group of young people is paying into the or rather sorry not population growth like boom and bust cycles so like a large amount of baby boomers and things like that following the smaller population sizes, means that there is irregularity. So that means that generally speaking, you're going to have time periods when there is a large amount of people trying to withdraw from the system and not a lot of people paying into it. That leads to insolvency and that's a serious problem for your ability to actually have a fiscally responsible government system that is capable of giving people money when they need it. Our third independent point, and this is what I think is the most important, is that it actively harms economic growth. So recognize that the comparative to a social security system is one wherein people plan for their own retirement, so they take that money and they invest it into something where the value of that money increases. Here's the problem, right now that money just goes into tax offers. It doesn't invest into anything. Doesn't really grow in any meaningful sense. It just stays there and then it gets put to somebody else. So this is economically inefficient for two reasons. First is that the comparative again is like investment in things that actually grow your wealth and grow the economy at large because there's like more activity going on so multiplier effects things like. But secondly, you don't account for inflation when it's just sitting in a coffer there. Like when it's just like sitting in whatever social security office like the money is literally worth less when you pay it back out. Like this is a just horribly inefficient system and just a ridiculous way of trying to allocate for people's retirements. Like even if you buy that some people are just going to be bad at paying for their retirements, it makes so much more sense to let the people who actually are capable of planning for their retirements to invest the money, have those investments taxed, and use that money to pay for social welfare programs for the people that couldn't get retirement stuff together in the short term. Like this is just the most ridiculous way of paying for people and actually ensuring a good quality of life for seniors and it just makes infinitely more sense to allow people to make their own decisions with their retirement funds and then tax those good decisions to pay for the people that made bad decisions. Proud to propose.
Marriage is outdated for two overarching reasons. First, because I think that marriage is just an outdated institution that suppresses general human nature as with regards to sexuality and human pleasure in life, and secondarily, marriage is outdated because it enforces archaic social norms that ultimately just oppress gender minorities like LGBTQ people, or it oppresses women more broadly as an institution. So those are the reasons why I think marriage is going to be bad. But before I get into those reasons, I want to I want to clarify what this is a debate is actually about, because I don't think that this is a debate about whether long term monogamous relationships can be good or can make some people happy. I think that that's something that is probably true, but I think that when we're talking about marriage, we're much more talking about the actual political, legal, religious institutions that enshrined such a way of life. And this is very important, because I think that as a result of these legal legal, political and institutions and the like, what this does is it creates this as the predominant way of having to live your life. So it means that what it does is it creates an environment of less choice, and it necessarily coerces or pressures people into living their life in a certain way. As a result and as a result of this, this really brings me into my first argument, which is about how this lessens human pleasure as a result of sexual interactions. And I think this is like an incredibly important thing, because like billions of people like in our world billions of people are going to fall in love, billions of people are going to have relationships, and like tons and billions of people are going to get married. So, whether or not these people are actually happy with their marriages, happy with their relationships and the like is incredibly important, and I think that that this is clearly not true, there's a reason why divorce rates are at all time highs, there's a reason why infidelity is at an all time high, and there's a reason why increasingly younger and younger people aren't even bothering to get married at all. It's because what I think that it does is marriage suppresses basic human emotions, and that is whether and that is that you want to oftentimes not just be tied down to one person, you want to have different relationships with different people at different stages of your life. What you may be interested in in in a partner is going to be very different when you're twenty than when you're thirty or when you're sixty or any other age. And this is important, because you're going to value different things, you're going to value different ways that you connect to people, because you're in a different point in your life emotionally at these different stages in your life. Sometimes you're going to value attractiveness more than security, you're going to value maybe like intellect, like there's all different ways in which people value different ways, and these things are never constant because people just change over time. And this is very important, because the human desire for excitement, the human desire for love, all of these things aren't just things that exist when you're in your twenties, which is when you're supposed to get married in a in like contemporary societies or things like not more like historical societies. These are things that are experienced throughout human life. So, I think that being forced down to one partner throughout most of your adult life is definitely going to take away a valuable part of human experience and pleasure and happiness. But I also think that this is oppressive socially. I think that it's quite obvious that the institution of marriage, even if we're getting a little bit better about this, albeit with much resistance, is incredibly exclusionary for a lot of gender minorities, people who are gay, people and the like. It's difficult for them to access the same political protections or legal protections that come as a result of marriage. But I think that secondarily, marriages has inherently sexist roots. The root of marriage is this idea of division of labor in that women should you should have marriage, that way men can be the breadwinners of the family unit, and that women should be the ones who are doing the light household work. And that's really what the point of marriage was, and that's where its religious roots come from. It was designed to make sure that women would not be able to access a lot of the privileges and benefits that men have, because it would set up society in a way which structurally disadvantages their ability to succeed in the workplace, to succeed in other walks of life, because it creates social expectations that they're going to do a predominance of housework and things like that. I think that without the institution of marriage, these things become a lot less prevalent. So, for all those reasons, incredibly proud to propose.
We should abolish the US electoral college. So for those who don't know, the american president is not elected by the american people. Instead, the american people vote for representatives to go from their state to a group called the electoral college, who then select the president amongst themselves. We have a few reasons why we think this practice should be abolished and replaced with a nationwide popular vote. First, we tell you that the electoral college is fundamentally undemocratic. Why is this so? The way that seats are allocated in the electoral college is that every state gets one seat according to the number of representatives and senators they have. This is a problem because every state gets two senators, and because the smaller states are still guaranteed at least one representative. What that means is that each electoral college person in california represents hundreds of thousands of people whereas in wyoming, they likely only represent a couple tens of thousands of people. Some people's votes count as much as five or six times more than other people's votes, and we think that this is fundamentally antithetical to the idea of liberal democracy. We think that people in california deserve the same representation by the president as people in wyoming. And recognize that because of the way the system is set up, people don't even campaign in many of the most populous states, like new york, texas and california. Ultimately, they ignore those voters to instead focus on people who are disproportionately powerful because of the electoral college, like voters in iowa and ohio. So those people have a huge amount of say and control over the president's policies and the future of the country relative to the vast majority of people, who live in safe states like california, that will always go to one particular party. Our second argument is that we think the electoral college causes unnecessary conflict and degradation of democracy in the united states. If you'll recall, in the two thousand election, george bush and al gore sued each other and ultimately, the new president was selected by the supreme court rather than any elected body. The reason why this is so was that the electoral college is vague and its proceedings don't make any sense. States allocate their electors according to a winner-takes-all principle, which means that a difference of two hundred votes in florida, which is a rounding error in a state of twenty million people, ultimately decided the presidential election. At that point, it's up to courts to recount votes if they're challenged by the candidates and ultimately, you lead to months-long, very expensive recount processes that wouldn't need to take place in the event of a popular vote, because no president has ever won the national popular vote by two hundred votes, but that often happens in given states. But not only does it create conflict in that sense, it also creates conflict in the sense that many people living in larger states are resentful and are more willing to back politicians in other sectors, such as the senate and house of representatives, who will represent their interests at the expense of the nation, because they don't feel represented by the president. So we think this undermines cooperation and also the perception of fairness in american democracy, and that this is very likely one reason why the US has chronically low voter turnout. The final reason we should abolish the electoral college, and this seems so obvious that I'm shocked that such intelligent men as james madison let the system go into effect, is that it allows for ties. Right now, if the electoral college is tied, then the senate, I believe, breaks the vote, not important who, someone in the legislature. But why would you have a system for choosing the president that allows for ties? You don't allow even numbers of people on corporate boards, you don't have an even number of judges on things like american idol. It just seems tremendously foolish to allow such an ineffective metric for choosing the president. And the other team may say that ties are unlikely, but they're certainly not impossible, especially given that some states always vote in a particular direction. We think that this shortcoming alone should be enough reason to get rid of the electoral college. For these reasons, it should be abolished. Thank you.
We should limit the right to self-defense. Right now in many jurisdictions, such as all common law countries, people have the right to reasonable self-defense. So, if some maniac is running at you with a knife in the US or britain, you would have the right to attack that person to keep them from trying to harm you. We think that this right should be severely curtailed in most instances. Our first argument is that violence begets violence. We think that ultimately when you allow this so-called right to self-defense, what you actually end up with is a more violent society overall. People are very bad at making these decisions, as I'll explain in just a moment, but because of that, you lead to a feedback loop where everyone thinks that they are acting in self-defense, even if actually they're being completely unreasonable. To use a perhaps not so recent but quite famous example, george zimmerman was a man in florida who murdered a young black man named trayvon martin, who was just walking down the street. Zimmerman was a virulent racist and self-appointed community watch figure who felt that his neighborhood was being threatened by trayvon martin's presence, even though he was just a high school boy walking down the street, and zimmerman killed him. Many people in his community thought that zimmerman was acting with reasonable self-defense, and many in the legal community argued that although he made a poor choice, because he believed he was acting in self-defense, that he should be able to take advantage of a legal protection called imperfect self-defense, which is basically when a person's state of mind changes the sentence that they receive. We think that this is ridiculous, that it becomes an umbrella for people to be racist, to be bigoted, to attack others and be violent, and then to get away with it because, " oh, they thought they were protecting themselves, " or " oh, they were acting in self-defense. " We think that this leads to more violence overall than in a society in which all violence is very heavily stigmatized and punished. We would prefer the latter to the former. Our second argument is about why it's okay for the government to intervene in this instance to take away someone's right to self-defense. We acknowledge that in some sort of state of nature that people would have a right to defend themselves. If you lived out in the wilderness, for instance, you would be able to protect yourself from a stranger. But in a society, we think that it's perfectly okay for the government to limit this, because people make bad decisions when they are afraid. We think that in the same way that we don't make let people make important decisions if they're drunk, we shouldn't let them make important decisions if they're terrified because similarly, they will not come to good conclusions. So ultimately, because of the risk of hurting innocent people, we think that the state should intervene and drastically limit this right to self-defense. We think that in this way you can protect innocent third parties from being harmed by other groups who think that they're acting in good faith. Our third and final point is that ultimately the right to self-defense is a false freedom or a privilege for some groups that doesn't equally apply to everyone. Consider, for instance, that if you are a big, burly man who served in the marines, that you're very likely to be able to defend yourself from any attacker. But if you're a one hundred pound woman, it's much less likely that you'll be able to take advantage of this. We can see that in many ways it's a very gendered right that only applies to men, and not even to all men. Because we see that if you have an ethnic minority or a minority religion person defend themselves from a member of the majority group, oftentimes they'll be seen as an aggressor even if you when you were reverse the races, they would be seen as a person conducting self-defense. So ultimately this is a so-called right that only accrues to men from the most privileged groups racially or religiously in a society. So we don't think that this right should be granted to those people when it can't be given fairly to everyone. So for all of these reasons, we should limit the right to self-defense. Thank you.
We should abolish the american jobs act. So what we mean by this is that we think the american jobs act was a poor policy that should not be implemented. Two arguments for this. The first one is about the opportunity costs of the american jobs act and we're going to break this down in a few different ways. First, let's talk about the opportunity cost in terms of money. Recognize that all federal spending is fungible, except for things like social security. So any money spent on this jobs act could have been spent in other ways instead. We tell you that back in twenty eleven, when this was proposed, the federal government could borrow at basically zero percent interest rates. It was the best time ever for the american people to borrow money. But at the same time there was a limit to how much the american people were willing to borrow to add to the deficit. We think that that was the perfect time to invest in infrastructure. I live in boston, the federal government originally offered to pay for a new subway line that ran very close to my house, conveniently. Using the money that would be borrowed against the deficit. But because of programs like the jobs act, ultimately support for infrastructure spending fell through. We think infrastructure would have been a better investment than this jobs act for a few reasons. One, jobs are going to come about anyway as a result of infrastructure spending. It's not necessary to have a separate bill here. Two, infrastructure has large returns over time. Many of the subway lines in boston have been in use for a hundred years. There's no reason to assume this one wouldn't have been as well. And the same is true for many bridges and other infrastructure projects around the country. So borrowing a bit of money now to pay for new infrastructure could have large returns for the next hundred years or even longer. And three, we tell you that ultimately, infrastructure spending is has more political support and that people are more willing to pay for something concrete then something abstract. So ultimately we think that because of the opportunity cost and the trade off with infrastructure spending, that the jobs act was poorly timed and not a very good use of our money. But the second sense in which this has a huge opportunity cost, is in terms of political will. In order for barack obama to get this policy put into place, he would have to rely on the support of democrats in congress and certain moderate republicans quite likely. There's a limited number of times that obama can offer people favors to support his policies, especially when many of these spending for the job act would not have helped people in every constituency. So it's less likely that we would have seen things like healthcare reform if this act had been put into place because there would have been a trade off in obama's ability to get legislators to follow his agenda. At that point we think that there are better uses of the president's political power, things like further healthcare reforms that would actually saves lives and also save trillions of dollars in the long term on government healthcare spending. So with that in mind, we don't think this was the best use of the political will and the ability to whip votes that the president has. Our second major argument is about why we think that this is risky spending though. It's true that deficits were low but at the same time this is the kind of spending that ultimately was very unpopular with republicans. Spending on abstract ends like job creation and funding it with tax cuts that were actually smaller than the expected spending. So what that means is we think that this would likely feed into a narrative of obama spending recklessly. This jeopardized the ability of the president to be reelected in twenty twelve and we think also contributed to severe democratic defeats in the house and senate in two thousand ten and twenty twelve. But moreover we think there's a greater risk of government shut down with this kind of spending. The american government, if you didn't know, hasn't had a budget in a long time. Instead it kind of runs based on these short term spending bills. And people are less willing to vote for them if they think the president is spending money unwisely. So for all these reasons we should abolish the american jobs act. Thank you.
We should abolish open primaries in the united states. It's important to recognize what a primary actually is and what the purpose of that primary is in the first place. Primaries are the part of an election process where parties themselves are able to directly interact with their constituents, with the base of support that has brought the party to national prominence, that has allowed the party to flourish and win elections at local and state levels. It's the opportunity for the party to interact with the people that volunteer, the people that donate, and the people that make the party possible in the form that it exists. It's a time for the party to communicate with its constituents rather than lobbyists and other special interest groups. This is why we believe that open primaries in the united states need to be abolished, because open primaries dilute the ability for the party to interact with its base. An open primary allows any individual within the united states, any member within the state to go and vote in a primary, even if they are not a registered member of that political party, or even if they're a registered member of the opposing political party. We think that this is problematic because firstly, the base is the most important structure that allows a party to survive. Party candidates are able to moderate after they become after they move through in the general election, but the base needs to support that candidate in their primary and foundational beliefs if the party is going to win elections and ultimately support that base that has given to them so much in the past. We think that it's more likely the case that when you have an open primary, results get skewed in such a way that individuals that have more moderate use, that don't actually represent what your base believes in, are going to be nominated nominated for office. This is a problem because firstly, it means that your base is less enthusiastic about the candidate and less likely to turn out, which means that at a party level, you're just less likely to get that candidate nominated. But secondly, it's a massive waste of an opportunity for the party to actually get an understanding of what their base wants. When you don't allow the base to be the exclusive messenger of what the party primary is stating, of the the main determining factor, the only determining factor in who the primary ultimately yields, it means that the party understands and has misinformation about what the base is looking for. For example, if you're a person in the democratic primary and you're running under a much more liberal much more liberal banner, but you allow for conservatives and an open primaries to take place and a more moderate candidate gets promoted, it means the democratic party isn't able to see the contention and the desire for a more progressive wing within the party. This is problematic because it ultimately leads to people becoming disenfranchised with that party and with the political process in general, because they never see their candidates making it to the general election. Yes, it is important for moderate candidates to make it to the general election, but over the entire history of presidential and and gubernatorial politics, people have moderated once they've gotten the nomination. We don't think that it's a major issue for candidates, and especially in the current time when persons like when people like donald trump can be elected and theresa may can be elected in the united kingdom, it's not especially important that moderation happened for the party to survive but simply that the base is heard, that people feel like they have a say in the party that they give their money and time to. We think that open primaries massively dilute that process. And it's not like individuals cannot choose to become a member of that party if they feel so deeply about it. You can still switch affiliation between political cycles if you feel so strongly about voting. We don't think that open primaries are the only way for participation to occur, but open primaries certainly avoid the potential for parties to learn from their base, communicate with their base, and yield a candidate that their base, the people that they exist to represent, want to have. For those reasons, we should abolish open primaries in the united states.
We should ban factory farming. Factory farming is inherently a corrupt practice which disregards the rights of animals simply to increase the profit of corporations. It takes the act of farming and attempts to remove as much space as possible, as much time as possible, and as many health standards as possible simply because corporations want to increase their bottom line. Because we think this is inherently corrupt we would support the following model: that all states ban factory farming requiring that the cultivation of animals be given a decent amount of space to move around in and banning acts like pumping them full of hormones simply to make them grow larger in a small amount of time. I have two arguments in today's debate. First off on how factory farming is inherently cruel and second on how it is actually dangerous for the general population. Factory farming is cruel on two levels, first to humans and secondly to animals. Individuals who are work in factory farms are typically paid incredibly low wages, they are largely immigrants who do not have the political impetus or the political ability to get another job due to stigma, and as such they have very little ability to hold their corporations accountable. As such, most factory farms have incredibly poor health standards and work their workers to the bone. This is incredibly dangerous as there are a variety of workplace incidents which occur at factory farms but we would also say it is psychologically damning working this much time with animals who are constantly suffering. Additionally, factory farming is cruel because it puts animals in tiny, tiny spaces. These spaces are essentially where they spend their entire lives, a cage which is six inches by six inches can be the entire space which a chicken gets to be for the entirety of its life. Although we would say that animals do not have as many rights as humans, having them suffer profoundly, have non -working legs, be unable to ever fully extend their wings simply because a corporation wants to draw profit clearly violates their rights. Animals clearly have sentience and refusing them the ability to even move around and express their sentience and autonomy is essentially treating them as non living beings and being unnecessarily cruel. It is clear that corporations can sacrifice some of their profit to expand their the animals living spaces and provide them with greater rights. Now my second argument is about how factory farming is dangerous for the general population. A lot of the time factory farms pump their animals full of dangerous hormones. These kind these particular kinds of hormones can be dangerous for children who eat them and can cause long term health harms for individuals who consume large quantities of meat. Similarly, the health standards at these factory farms are not up to par. All if you compare factory farms to largely open air farms you will actually find more dangerous bacteria more illnesses in these animals then animals in open air. This means things like salmonella and e. Coli are going to be far more prevalent in meat which comes from factory farms rather than meat which comes from open air farms. It is the obligation of government to keep the citizens safe. It is impossible for someone to know before they open a package and eat something if it is tainted or otherwise dangerous to consume. The only actor which can protect the people is the government and as such we have an obligation to ban factory farming.
The right to self defense is absolute. So by this we mean to say that in countries that constitutionally guarantee their citizens rights, we think that there should be no limitation on the right to self defense. So three broad arguments to this. The first is about facilitation of rights, the second is about the idea of proportional response, and the last is about where this right arises. So with regards to facilitating other rights. We think that it is necessary to defend one's own life in order to access any other right. So whatever constitutional guarantees you may have, whether that be the right to vote, the right to be on a jury, the right to bear arms etcetera. All of these depend on your own continued well being. So we think that at that point, if any other right that you have is absolute, then your right to self defense must be as well in order to defend that right. It's almost an extension of the other right that is absolute. And we tell you that there is probably an absolute right to life in most countries. No one is allowed to kill you, the state can't kill you in most countries. So this is an absolute right. And at that point we think it's therefore necessary, at least in those countries, that your right to self defense also be absolute in order to facilitate that other right. Our second argument is about the types of limitations that we tend to see on one's right to self defense. In many countries courts would like to see some idea of proportionate response when you respond to a threat against your own life. So for instance, they wouldn't allow you to justify killing someone because somebody hit you, for instance, because you probably wouldn't have died from being hit again. But it's impossible to know someone else's intentions. If someone behaves in a violent or threatening way towards you, such that you fear for your own life, we think that that is legitimate and that you need to act upon it. We think that people have a good sense of their own safety, and furthermore that no one else who was in that not in that situation can accurately gauge what it was like to be in that situation. So at that point we think that we ought defer to allowing people to take whatever action they think is necessary when their own life is under threat. And we already use a similar metric for separating different crimes in the status quo, such as intent for first and second degree murder in the united states. So we think that at that point courts are already involved in the sort of thinking and ought apply it more broadly. What's more. When situations unfold quickly as they often do when violence is in play, we don't think that one can afford to sit back and think, hmm, can I disable this person in a non-lethal way, or can I respond with a lesser amount of force. People act as quickly as they can and often don't have the ability to think through all of their options clearly. Lastly we think that the idea of proportionality is probably arbitrary. We don't see why one person hitting another should proportionately be responded to only by hitting if one is much stronger than the other person or something like that. We just don't think that it's ever possible to be fair about this type of proportionality, we think it will always be arbitrary. So our last argument is about why we think that this right arises from nature. So consider that in the state of nature, so if we imagine way back to the dawn of time when people didn't live in states, everyone could defend themselves from others and this was seen as something that was acceptable. The big divide between whether or not something is just or unjust seems to be whether it is responsive or aggressive. So attacking another person in the state of nature is probably still wrong and that's one reason why people form states, but defending oneself is almost certainly not wrong. And you can see this extended into the fact that every society around the world allows people to defend themselves from a hostile attack. So we think that at that point this right ought be absolute, because it is a human universal that arises from nature that human beings are allowed to defend themselves from other human beings if their life is under threat, or if they feel unsafe in their person. Now look, we're not defending people abusing this right, like we saw with the trayvon martin case in florida a few years back, but we think that it's entirely possible for courts to arbitrate which instances of self defense are legitimate and which are not, and then to decide that in legitimate cases the right to self defense is absolute. So for these reasons we think that that right ought be considered fundamentally absolute. Thank you.
The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish double jeopardy. Two main areas of clash, the first on the nature of our system of justice. We think that a crime doesn't change, just because time has passed. If I murdered someone fifty years ago, they are still murdered now, and the law remains the same, and the victim was still harmed, and the person is still dead. We think that at the point, that new evidence comes out, maybe the jury was stacked, and we have reason to believe that there was an unfair acquittal, maybe there was a confession, or even the hundreds of years of new technology that we have acquired allows us to do things like DNA testing, and blood testing. We think that the justice system needs to represent a need to adjust, to maintain what the original spirit is. We think we have to acknowledge, that sometimes the trial system is imperfect, and the only way to solve this is by allowing something like double jeopardy to solve for these situations. Because currently, the problem is that people, after getting acquitted once, and just setting up the right system of circumstances, hiring an expensive enough lawyer, any of these kinds of things. Like, silencing enough witnesses means they get away scot free. We think it is always a larger rights violation, to let someone go free than to put someone who is innocent through the trial process twice, because, in the end, if you are innocent, you are likely to be found so twice. But, if you are guilty, you get to go free all forever after you're after you're tried once, under double jeopardy. We think the impact of this is that, if if our justice system cannot be trusted, or is inconsistent, or allows people who are guilty to go free, due to things like the lack of double jeopardy, we think people are okay with flaunting the law, and losing trust in the system. Things like OJ simpson getting away without any punishment, and then writing the book, if I did it, describing the crime and being like: yeah, I totally did it, are exactly the problem with our current society. Criminals are okay with afterwards basically yelling to the world: look at the crime that I've committed, because they know they cannot answer it. We think this decreases the general public's trust in the system, and decreases the efficiency overall. Our secondary of clash has to do with victims' rights. Because we think that when we're evaluating the justice system, we're working in a system of rights violations, and trying to compromise on who gets to be justified where. And we think, the most important person in these situations is often the victim, because if someone has perpetrated something against a victim, they have violated their rights, and now owes a debt to them, and we because of what has been taken to them. We think that a violation we have we think that it is important to be certain that that , that you are that the person, who you're letting go, is truly innocent, in order to fulfill your obligation to the victim and their rights. We think, more than this though, that it is unlikely to be a system that is abused. We think oftentimes resources are limited, and retrying the same person, over and over, is not only taxing to all those involved, but also incredibly monetarily consuming, and we just don't think that state legislatures have that ability. Like, even if someone is incredibly racist, if they don't have the funds to amplify that racism, they're not going to retry the same person seventy million times. More than this, we don't think that victims are going to push for this either. At the point that someone has been found innocent once or twice, either they run out of money, or they ran out of the energy to do so. We think it is important to recognize that, if a victim once closure, a second acquittal will oftentimes be enough. But the problem, with allowing someone to not have to enter that second process in the first place, is that you are lacking the potentiality of closure at all. We always think that the larger rights violation is on the side of having double jeopardy, we think that the only people who it protects are those who are guilty, and therefore it ought be abolished. For these reasons proud to propose.
The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce universal health care. Two main areas of clash. The first, on health care being a right. Most societies and countries recognize a fundamental right to life for all individuals that applies regardless of your economic standing, race, religion, or other or other arbitrary differences. We see this when we balk at human rights abuses, because even when it is someone who is incredibly poor, someone who is homosexual, we are still unhappy that they are having these rights violated, because your rights don't come from your immutable characteristics, but rather from some deeper level of personhood that everybody share, it is shared in the way that we suffer in the same ways, in the way that we interact with the world. But also, I think it's important to establish exactly how arbitrary the lottery of birth is, and why it can never be a factor in deciding where rights lie. We think at the point the course of an entire life can be changed based on who your parents are, whether you are born into a rich or a poor family, defines whether you can access higher education, defines whether when hard times come, you are able to have a pillow to lean back on. At the point that such arbitrary differences and like background set aside our entire life like in the long term, we don't think that you can meaningfully affect the way that you distribute rights based on this, insofar as anybody could have had this situation. Let's talk about health care specifically though. Because we think that the right to life is only accessible if you also have access to healthcare, which makes healthcare a facilitative right. If I cannot live a fully self-actualized life, because I don't have my daily dosage of medication because I cannot afford it, we don't think you're actually meaningfully accessing the right to life. But more than this, we tell you the government already recognizes these kinds of rights, when it does things like redistribute wealth through taxes and supports welfare. We think this is already a message on the part of the government that says, in order to fulfill the right to life, we must first fulfill some basic needs at the beginning. We also think that is the government's responsibility to do things like this. Insofar as the government exists in order to protect the rights that individuals cannot protect themselves, then the right to healthcare and the right to health lays under this. I myself cannot administer the needed medical attention that I might need in order to survive, and it becomes the job of the government to make sure that I have access to that, because of the rights that I give up in exchange. More than this, we think that the message that the government sends when they don't provide health care is one that is incredibly pernicious. Because it says that the amount that we make dictates whether we live or die. And we think that this necessarily undercuts the equality of every individual, because it evaluates people based on the amount of money that they make and not on the fact that they are human. Our second area of clash has to do with why it's good for society. We think that people themselves are individually more productive when they are not sick or struggling with illnesses. But more on a deeper level than that. We think that oftentimes preventative care, that people who don't have insurance just don't have access to, is incredibly important in preserving longevity. If I can't go to the hospital and get regular breast cancer checkups, I will not know that I have breast cancer until it is far too late to do anything about it, and my life is cut short by many years by comparison to other people around me. We think this is incredibly pernicious, because what this means is that people who don't have access to to healthcare oftentimes end up living much shorter lives that are often much more dangerous, because when you're living with chronic pain or chronic illness, you're also not able to like keep up with your workload, you're going to be taking more sick days, and you're going to oftentimes be much more likely to end up fired or lose your job. Finally though, I think that a lot of the time the effects this has on youth are also very important. We think that a lot of the time, youth are expected to drop out of school and take care of sick sick people, and they just wouldn't have this burden if those people had access to insurance. Basically what this means, is that if my sick mother had insurance when she when she got cancer, I wouldn't have to drop out of school in order to take care of her, and my life would then be much much different, and probably better. For these reasons, proud to propose.
We should disband the united nations. So what we're defending in this debate is for member countries in the UN to voluntarily leave until eventually the organization no longer exists. And we acknowledge that this would be unlikely but when we say we should, we mean that we think this would be a better world than the one that we live in right now. We're fine with other international organizations like the world trade organization, the IMF or the world bank continuing to exist. We think that the problems that we have with the UN are unique to that organization. We also think, before we get into our three arguments, that it's likely that groups like unesco would be able to continue to exist as independent organizations even if the main united nations were broken up. So with that in mind, three arguments for why we think it would be a better world without the UN. First, the united nations is fundamentally undemocratic. If you think about the structure of the united nations, it gives five countries total control over what the others are allowed to vote on. The security council, which was set up after world war two and hasn't been adjusted since, has a an effective veto over any policy that the united nations is allowed to take. At that point we see that countries like the US can hold the rest of the voting body hostage. We see that for instance almost every other country around the world wants to censure israel for their treatment of the palestinians but the united states is able to intervene and prevent any action from being taken. Similarly, russia has been able to get away with their actions in the ukraine because they can veto any UN action that would put a stop to the invasion of crimea. But second under this, is that the UN is fundamentally a dictator's club. Remember that people like saddam hussein and muammar gaddafi used to sit on the UN panel for human rights. We see that because the UN general body is majority vote that ultimately countries with no interest in human rights or democracy are able to dominate the united nations. Dictators are regularly the appointed to oversee human rights, countries which pollute the environment are appointed to oversee clean development, etcetera. Everyone has an incentive to vote for other countries like themselves and since only a minority of countries are liberal democracies this means that illiberal or undemocratic countries will always control the UN. Now obviously they can't do anything too important because of the security council, but remember that two of the members of the security council are also illiberal countries. You have russia, which is semi-democratic and china, which is an open dictatorship. Our second argument is that the united nations is ultimately ineffective. So if you consider the conflicts in the world since world war two, many of them have been quite large. Think about the iran iraq war. This had huge tank battles, chemical weapons, child soldiers, everything that you would expect to see in on a front in world war two or in world war one. But this happened while the UN was around. Why? The united nations is actually powerless to stop its member nations from going to war. The UN was sold to member countries as a way to prevent conflict, but it has ultimately failed to do so. Powerful countries like the united states can invade weaker countries like iraq or vietnam at will. Pariah countries like iran can attack their neighbors like iraq whenever they ultimately wish to. In places like rwanda, where the UN doesn't have a clearly staked interest, UN soldiers stood by and watched a genocide happened and actually did nothing. There were canadian and european soldiers for the UN in rwanda who did nothing to stop the genocide. So we see that the united nations cost a great deal of money and doesn't actually do anything particularly useful. The other team might say that the UN sponsors good organizations like unesco, but why not just have those organizations and separate it from this dictator's club that ultimately has failed in its primary purpose? Namely to implement world peace. For these two reasons I think it's clear that we should disband the united nations. Thank you.
Water fluoridation so in this debate we think that there are two main arguments that we want to make. The first is about popularity in government legitimacy and the second is about how there's really little unique benefit that is provided by water fluoridation and why especially given the first point, this means that we should end it. So on that first point, popularity in government legitimacy. We would say that a government can only be legitimate if it rules with the popular consent of the people. This doesn't just apply to leaders in charge that they are chosen through the popular consent of the people, but we would say it also applies to the actions that those leaders take. It's both the policy and the leaders that must have popular legitimacy. Fluoride in the water is well known to be a very unpopular government policy. There are many people that fear its side effects. There are many people that are afraid that can do long term damage to one's health and there are many people that are just skeptical of the idea of the government choosing what goes into their body and making decisions about what chemicals are going to enter their body and there are very few people, which is this is important recognize too, there are very few people that are adamantly in favor of it. There are very few people that are very that think it's critical to their health, that think it's important, that think that it's something that you can only get through putting fluoride in the water for the masses. All these things given that this is the case, fluoridation is not furthermore fluoridation just isn't a life or death situation. Not having fluoride in your water is not going to cause any sort of real bodily harm to anyone that's being stripped of it and because of this, we think that in order for the government to be legitimate, it should defer to the popular will of the people. So even if water fluoridation doesn't cause harm to people, there's no scientific evidence that it causes damage to people because the people do not want this to be the case, we think that we should bend to the popular will of the people. Maybe it would be the case that if it showed to do demonstrably and excessively good things for individual health and there were tons of people that are adamantly in favor for of it this would be a different discussion but as it stands in the status quo, fluoridation also does not do that much benefit for people. So water fluoridation the only effect that has been scientifically proven is that it improves teeth health. It improves your gums and makes it a little better for your teeth and it makes it less likely that your teeth are going to decay and this is something that can be improved if people want to take those actions on their own and this is what is also important recognize. Even though water fluoridation does some good, this is all good that you could get from regular dental checkups, through brushing your teeth and flossing, and taking very easy steps that individuals can make decisions about for themselves. This trade-off is incredibly small especially given that. That if I want to have all the benefits of water fluoridation even if the government cancels water fluoridation in putting fluoride in the water, I can still get them with very little cost to myself and have the same quality of what I would have gotten if the government had been doing it. When the trade-off is this small it's especially important to defer to the popular will of the people. So given that water fluoridation is both not very popular and not very impactful, not incredibly uniquely positively impactful on the lives of the people, we believe that we should end water fluoridation.
The retirement age that, we have in the status quo, is an ancient relic that might have been more suitable, a hundred years ago when it was set, but in no way is it still relevant today. What we suggest to do, is to raise the age of retirement from sixty five to at least seventy. Two arguments here: why this is a crucial step in order to prevent a financial disaster, and, second argument, who is getting hurt here, and why are we okay with that. First argument: so, the second that a man retires, he deserves some benefits from the state, namely pensions. In most states we can see, that funding those paid pensions amounts to the single largest expense in the in the countries' budget. We are talking astronomical sums, so the retirement age marks the point, in which a man stops being a productive citizen, that is like contributing to the state's budget, and is starting to be a source of expenditure for this country. What we must understand, is that obviously there is no one objective age, in which we can determine that this is like the right retirement age, and that. So, eventually we have to set an age in a, somewhat like random fashion, in which it is clear that some individual cases are going to be like, this age is going to be too low for them, or too high for them, so how do we still make a decision? And the answer is, we have to do like a calculation of some average, that is based on the empirical data that we have in the market, and eventually reach a number that is going to be optimal, in terms of people's abilities, and the country's ability, to fund these retirement funds. The data that affects this decision, is mainly life expectancy, the size of the population, and physical ableness of people to actually work. We say that these empirical data, have changed drastically along the years, the recent couple of decades, and they are expected to continue changing rapidly in the future. So, today an average person lives to to see a much older age, at least like ten years from a few decades ago, he stays healthy to a much older age, and be as like since that is the case, then surely the outcome of this formula also needs to change. That is because, today most countries, most western countries, experience a decrease in the size of the population, and aging, which means that less young people are required to fund more old people, for longer periods of time. This is unsustainable, and the inevitable outcome is going to be a collapse, and a bankruptcy of the entire social security system, which means that an entire generation of people, that have paid social security and pension funds their entire lives, are going to be left without nothing and going to pay the price for this. So, second argument who is getting hurt here? Firstly, it is important to explain that in a long term, there is no actual harm, because for many young people that haven't start started thinking even about their retirement, they will already planned out their career, based on the new situation, therefore, they will have no reason to complain. So clearly who does get hurt hurt here, from this act of raising the age of retirement, are the people that are today approaching this age, and I've already planned out their paths, or their career, in in like, based on the on the status quo, and are now going to be forced to work several more years. Why can we live with that? We say simply because, this damage, and and like we do accept that it's unfair to an extent but, to an extent, but this damage isn't nearly close to the amount of unfairness in damage, that's expected to an entire generation that is going to pay the price as soon as the country, as all economic like all economic experts basically agree on, can no longer withhold its promises. Please propose.
We should introduce compulsory voting. So what we're going to argue for you this evening is that countries like the united states or canada which do not have compulsory voting right now, should adopt a system similar to what they have in australia, whereby people have to go to the polls on election day and turn in a ballot. People are free to turn in a blank ballot, or write gandolf or darth vader on their ballot if they want to, but everyone has to go to the polls and vote on election day. So three reasons why we think this policy should be implemented in countries that don't have it yet. First we think this changes the incentives of political parties in a very positive way. Right now, there's a huge incentive for political parties to appeal to the populations that actually go out and vote. After all it doesn't matter if you command a huge lead with people who don't go to the polls on election day. What does this look like? It means that older people and wealthier people who are more likely to be able to go to the polls or to choose to go vote, are much more likely to have political parties cater to them. So the interests of wealthy elderly people, particularly white people in countries like the US and canada, are disproportionately influential in our democracy. We think that if you introduced compulsory voting, parties would now have more of an incentive to appeal to other groups in society as well. In other words, suddenly it matters what young black people in chicago think because they're out at the polls in as great a numbers as old white people. At the end of the day, we think that this is important because it means that parties want to appeal to more people so they will implement policies that actually help a broader portion of society than what we see right now when they try to appeal only to a narrow section of society who actually go out to vote. Our second argument is that this would lead to better participatory democracy. So what we mean by this is that right now there is a tremendous amount of apathy in many western countries. In the united states' midterm elections, ones between presidential elections that is to say, often have voter turnout well below fifty percent. In britain, voter turnout is rarely over sixty. On the other hand in brazil or australia, obviously voter turnout is close to one hundred percent. What this means is that there is a greater culture in those countries of participating in elections. Many people in america or similar countries, never vote in their lives. They don't feel any connection to their country's democracy. This means that they're less likely to try to stay informed about the issues, less likely to know who their politicians and leaders are, and generally less likely to participate in civic society. We think that for democracy to be successful, people must have an incentive to participate and that compulsory voting is the best possible incentive. And our third argument is that we would have a more representative government. Right now we see that governments as I mentioned earlier reflect the interests of a relatively narrow scope of people. But now I want to talk about what it actually looks like when you have a government that represents everyone. I think it is much more likely that governments would focus on social policy, on helping low income people, on helping immigrant families and the like, if we had compulsory voting. This is true because right now the government actually doesn't represent the american, canadian, british, whatever country you choose, doesn't represent their people. It represents the voting population. But when you make it so that everyone is the voting population, suddenly the state must actually care about what is good for everyone. At that point we think it's much more likely that you get policies which are tailored to the general interest than those which are tailored to certain special interest groups which vote disproportionately. So for these reasons, we should implement compulsory voting in countries that do not already do so. Thank you.
Year round schooling will bring more good than harm. So by year round schooling we mean a system where students go to school for several weeks, and then have a short break. As opposed to a system where students go for months at a time and then have a very long break. So perhaps on our side we're defending a world where students go to school for eight weeks and have two weeks off, and on the other side they're defending a system where students go to school for eight months and then have three months off. So, our first argument is that students will learn better with year round schooling. Students forget a great deal of material over the summer, which then has to be re-learned at the beginning of the next school year. For instance, many students forget advanced mathematical concepts and have a more difficult time adjusting when they get back to school. This means that valuable instruction time is spent not on new material or on the kind of helpful review that we do every day, but rather on re-teaching material that students have forgotten. And since no two students are the same, it seems likely that some will remember what the others have forgotten, and ultimately he will not use class time as effectively. We also tell you that there are some skills, like second language, that need to be practiced every day or they will be lost. So for instance if you're teaching english as a second language at your school, those students will likely forget a great deal of vocabulary and lose speaking proficiency, if they aren't practicing every day during a several months of long break. We also tell you that we can probably have students go to school for a longer period of time every year using this system. Burnout is a real phenomenon. It is true that students couldn't go to school every single day. Children, especially younger children, simply don't have the capacity to focus day in and day out the way that adults do. But we tell you that we could better fight burnout by having a short break every few weeks, rather than having one very long break. For instance, american students tend to go to school for less than two hundred days a year because they have such a long break, in order to avoid burnout. But finnish and japanese students often go to school well over two hundred and forty days a year, so they actually get more contact hours. It's unsurprising then that countries like finland or south korea or japan, which have year round schooling, also have the best schools and the best students. We tell you that these students are doing better than their peers in the US or britain, simply because they have more contact hours. It's difficult for students to learn if they're not around their teacher for months on end, and if they're wasting all their time reviewing. So we think that it's clear that students would learn better and learn more with year round schooling, and that alone is enough of a reason for us to implement it, because obviously the purpose of schools in the first place is to educate students. But on top of that, our second argument is that we think this is better for parents, especially low income parents. So right now, having your children home for a very long break in the summer means spending a lot of money on daycare. If you have children who are under say, thirteen, and can't be home for a long period of time on their own, and if you don't have a lot of people in your community who can look after them, then you have to spend money on daycare, which is very expensive in many parts of the world for low income families. We also tell you that in many places where schools provide breakfast or lunch to students, families are under more food distress during the summer break, because they have to provide more meals for their children. This often means that children get worse nutrition during the summer. I'm reminded of the community where I grew up where churches would send food home with kids during the summer, because otherwise they just wouldn't have anything to eat, it's quite sad. And we tell you that you can reduce this by having children be in school more often so that we know that they're being fed properly, because they're eating two good meals a day at school. So we think that this would be better and take some burden off of parents. And lastly we think it would be easier to plan family travel if you didn't have everyone in the country trying to travel in december, but rather spread out throughout the year. So we think that year round schooling will bring more good than harm, because it's better for children and better for their parents. Thank you.
We should further exploit small modular reactors. So in order to make sure this is a clean debate, we want to say that when we mean further exploit we think that this refers to building factories to produce these small modular reactors and encouraging their adoption around the globe. So we're not talking about something marginal. We want to see wide scale adoption of these small modular reactors and just as a bit of background, these are basically small nuclear fission reactors which are produced in a factory and then can be sent anywhere in the globe and be installed and start producing energy. Kind of like the use of oil based generator power plants right now in some isolated locations but nuclear. So with that in mind, we have two big contentions. The first is about how do we spread green energy? There are many locations that in the status quo don't have access to alternative forms of energy. Some forms like solar power require that you be in a certain part of the globe so that you get enough sunlight. Others like geothermal power rely on you having access to volcanoes and other similar sources of geothermal energy. So we see that lots of forms of green energy aren't practical everywhere in the world, but people living everywhere still need power. So how do we get power to them? We think that because you can deploy these small modular reactors pretty much anywhere in the globe, that you can install any power plant, that they can replace these dirty forms of energy like oil based power plants in many rural areas of the globe and many isolated areas of the globe and recognize that right now these are some of the dirtiest places on earth. Think about greenland for instance, basically all of their electricity is produced by oil burning power plants. So it's the equivalent of running hundreds and hundreds of cars all day in order to produce enough electricity for tens of thousands of people who live in greenland. Now you might say oh greenland doesn't have that many people, it's not that big a concern, but ultimately, the harm of burning that much oil is much greater than the harm of using traditional power production methods in a place like new york where we have economies of scale. We think it's important that in these places the ones which are the dirtiest per capita that we can replace fossil fuels with something cleaner. Now why do we get that on our side? We tell you that fundamentally these small modular reactors are the first form of alternative energy that can be applied here and that even if it's expensive it will be worth it for the international community to subsidize these reactors in order to reduce the dirtiest types of energy production around the globe. The ones that do the most outsized amount of damage to our common environment. In particular under this I'd like to talk about how this would affect developing nations. Consider that many countries the problem isn't energy production its energy distribution. In a country like pakistan that's very mountainous with lots of disparate communities spread across a large geographic area, we think that it's very difficult to provide electricity much less clean electricity, but these small modular reactors are an easy solution. If we can install them near a group of villages then it would be easy to one, improve people's quality of life by providing them with clean energy and two, to do so without having to connect them to the larger electrical grid which would reduce the cost of providing the electricity to them. So at the end of the day, we think that these will be particularly useful in the developing world and for that reason that we should further exploit them. Our second contention is about why green energy is a necessity? So you've all heard on TV about peak oil and global warming. Basically we can't keep doing the same thing and expecting different results in the future. Burning oil and coal and natural gas are not long term solutions to our energy problems and as more and more people expect a higher quality of life as their countries develop, we're only going to need more and more energy. This is just going to create a feedback loop where the earth heats up more and more as more people's countries develop and ultimately more people will be put at risk because of this increased energy consumption. It is therefore extremely urgent that we provide clean energy around the globe to people outside of the global north who don't have access to clean energy right now if we're going to have a safe earth in the future. So for these reasons we should further exploit small modular reactors. Thank you.
Organ donation should be mandatory. When there are thousands of people on waiting lists simply dying in hospital beds because they cannot get an organ, it is illogical that we do not make organ donation mandatory. Simply put, forcing individuals to donate their organs upon death will save tens of thousands of lives, depoliticize the issue of organ donation, and simply put, increase the rights of all individuals who currently want organs and who will need organs in the future because their organs fail. With this in mind, we would support the following model. That all states with the resources to do so should force individuals to give their organs upon death. It's unlikely that individuals will attempt to hide their organs or otherwise make it impossible for the state to get them. So we won't need to punish dead individuals for not donating their organs. We would say there'll probably be fines or other punishments for individuals who want to stop the government from getting organs after their family members die, but we don't think that will be a major issue. With that in mind, two arguments. First off is about rights. We would say that individuals do not have a right to their body or honestly, any property upon death. My opponents might come up and discuss the idea of inheritance. That we allow individuals to allocate resources upon their death. The only reason that we allow inheritance to exist is because of the utility of the issue. We think that's more effective for people to decide and define what they where they want their resources to go so they'll continue to save their money in later life and continue to work for money as their life goes on. This is a completely different issue with organs. There's no incentive to destroy your organs upon death because that would simply be a greedy move that would be stigmatized by the whole of society and as such, there's no utility to be gained by allowing individual to have property rights upon their death over their organs. At this point, we don't think there's any affirmative right your body. Once you are no longer a moral actor and you do not have the ability to define those rights. Similarly, we don't think this right would even belong to families. Even if you think some individuals ought inherit these rights simply put, because family members cannot gain any true utility from using these organs effectively unlike things like property and money which would be effective for inheritance. Another rights claim that's important in this debate is the idea of inequality. In the status quo, poor individuals cannot get organs because they die on the waiting list. If they can't pay for things like dialysis or expensive drugs they die because they can not get organs. The idea of making organ donation mandatory will likely equilibrate the system and make it so poor individuals are likely to access organs because the list will be far shorter and far faster once you get on it. Without any other analysis but the number of lives saved, we think that when rights are truly unequal based on money, the system is being oppressive. We would say that solving impressive system by equilibrating it and allowing all individuals to benefit from it, is a moral good in and of itself. Now my second argument is simply put that organ donation saves lives. When you make organ donation mandatory the number of organs that hospitals and other organizations have increases massively. As such, individuals are able to get an organ and save their lives. We think that this means that individuals will live longer lives, more fruitful lives, be more efficient overall, making individuals happier. Individuals who experience loss less often are less likely to feel depressed or otherwise unable to contribute to society meaningfully. Additionally, we think that there'll be fewer stipulations on individuals who get organs. We think that in the status quo, it is necessary to be incredibly selective. People who get new lungs can't smoke at all, can't even be around smoky products. Individuals with new livers can't drink at all even in moderation. We would say that removing these massive restrictions on individuals, removing the ability for them to have autonomy is a good in and of itself. Making organ donation mandatory and having a plethora of organs with which to give individuals will likely remove these policies and allow individuals to do what they want even after an organ donation. As such, organ donation should be mandatory.
We should ban organic food for a simple reason. It is less safe than conventionally produced foods. So in order to establish why this is true, when I first talk about how this about how organic food is because of the fact that it doesn't use industrial pesticides, and because of the fact that it lacks additives, it's going to make you more likely to be sick. The reasons why this is true is for a few reasons. First and foremost, the importance of pesticides. Pesticides are incredibly important for controlling diseases, whether it's e coli or salmonella or other kinds of naturally food borne diseases. This is the reason why you saw the recent disease outbreaks at chipotles across the united states of america that led to numerous health problems for people. The reason this is true is because due to the lack of industrial strength pesticides, it's more likely that diseases are going to be able to be kept. But furthermore, because of the variant methods it's also more likely that the diseases that the variant methods of manufacturing for these foods in a very growing methods for these foods, it's also more likely that these diseases are going to prop up in different parts of production facilities and are less likely going to be able to be controlled for. But additionally we also think that the presence of additives in food is important to you because it reduces spoilage, and while spoilage is obviously important for making sure that food can be consumed for a longer period of time, spoilage is also important because spoiled food simply isn't safe to eat, and unsafe food to eat could be quite bad for people. So the reason why we think that food safety is obviously incredibly important to consider as an issue is because we don't want people to be getting sick. That obviously can lead to strain on public health resources or the individual health resources of people, it leads to less productivity in the workforce, and it's just something that it seems like the government should have an obligation to help people with. So why do we think that therefore this risk of organic food being less safe is an unnecessary risk. Because theoretically this risk could be outweighed or if it was shown that there were actually long term benefits of consuming organic food, long term benefits like you're less likely to get cancer maybe from these pesticides, you are less likely to get other kinds of long term illnesses that could come from using these manufactured goods. So we actually don't think this is very likely though, because while there is rock solid evidence and there is truth to the fact that these pesticides make sure that the food is is more safe in that you're going to be getting less diseases, the science behind the benefits of organic food is quite flimsy. There isn't really any clear scientific consensus that there's actually any benefits to organic food. So there's no real point to deferring to that logic. But even if you don't believe that, even if you do think that there is still benefits to organic food, we don't actually think that the average consumer is going to experience these benefits. And the reason for that is because this is dependent on the way in which that food is actually produced, first of all at facilities. And this is a problem, because oftentimes facilities will be using varied production means, there's not going to be a unified system like with industrialized farming that is going to ensure quality control for these foods. So this means that you're not necessarily going to even get the greater nutritional values or health attractions, because you can't actually confirm that you're going to be getting the organic food that experiences these benefits, even if some organic food does. But finally this is also dependent on health regulatory agencies. And the problem with this is that health regulatory agencies are oftentimes able to operate outside of the public eye and outside of public scrutiny. But the scrutiny that they do not operate away from though is the scrutiny of people, of lobbyists, and the scrutiny of the corporation that they're supposed to regulate. Throughout the entire world, especially in developed countries, you see revolving doors of politics, you see people who are former members of the industries become regulators of industries. This is a problem, because it means that it essentially creates a system in which people are misled to buy organic food under the assumption it is healthier for them, and that that in reality it is less safe for them and just cost more money. And it is for those reasons we should ban organic food.
We should further exploit sustainable energies. Sustainable energies are those which are consumed at such a low rate during their use that effectively they could be used forever. A good example of this would be wind power. You can put up lots of turbines but that doesn't stop the wind from blowing. Similarly, building solar panels doesn't stop the sun from shining. By comparison, burning natural gas means that that natural gas is gone forever and can't be used by future generations. And by further exploit, we mean that we should come up with new and innovative ways to take advantage of these sustainable energies and that we should use them to the exclusion of non-sustainable energies, like fossil fuels. Our three arguments this evening are about climate change, energy independence and technological advancement. So, about climate change: sustainable energies, by and large, are much greener than non-sustainable energies. This is because the main unsustainable energy that we use, fossil fuels, releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, whereas the leading sustainable energies, like solar power, don't release these kind of pollutants. Climate change poses a huge risk to the global population. Millions of people are going to lose their homes as the sea rises over the next few decades, especially people in low-lying countries like bangladesh that might be submerged for much of their territory. Moreover, there's going to be a risk of great disease, of crops failing, effectively a biblical plague almost as a result of climate change. So anything we can do to slow climate change, we ought to do, and adopting sustainable energy will let us delay climate change or minimize climate change by reducing the output of these carbon emissions. Our second argument is about energy independence. Basically, a handful of countries right now control all of the energy production in the world. Countries with lots of oil, like venezuela, russia, and the united states, are able to dictate how and when other countries can provide oil. Remember the opec embargo against the US back in the nineteen seventies and how badly that affected normal life here. Now, today, the US produces oil, but many countries can't do that. France, for instance, could never become an oil-producing country because there's no oil there. But what a country like france can do to achieve energy independence is to build sustainable energy sources. So, in france, they have lots of nuclear power plants, and they take a lot of advantage of hydropower as well. And as a result, something like eighty percent of their energy is produced in the country, and they export a lot of electricity to the rest of europe. What this means is that no foreign country could ever affect france's industry and economy by limiting their access to power, it all comes domestically, whereas a country like britain that imports lots of natural gas could be cut off from that natural gas by an opponent such as russia, and then their economy would be tanked by the lack of energy. And our third and final point is about technological advancement. In the past, major investments in new technologies have led to secondary benefits in the form of other technologies. The space race is the classic example of this. In their efforts to covertly develop intercontinental ballistic missiles, the US and the soviet union spent billions of dollars sending people to space, to the moon, to space stations, and so on. Ultimately, we got huge amounts of technology that's used today on earth from these missions, like new materials and medical technologies. Investment in sustainable energies on a huge scale is likely to lead to similar new technologies that emerge as just a side effect of all of this research becoming available. So for all these reasons, we should further exploit sustainable energies. Thank you.
Sustainable forest management brings more good than harm. So in this debate we're talking about not just you know general good governance of forest, but a particular set of guidelines that has been set up by international agreements, by groups like the united nations conference on environment and development, in order to set up general principles for forestry. So with that in mind we have three arguments. First, protecting the environment. One of the main goals of sustainable forest management is to protect the environment. We see that in many parts of the world, like brazil, very important ecosystems that can never be replaced are being destroyed at an alarming rate because of four manage poor management of forests and forest resources. The net result is that species are going extinct and ultimately we will never be able to reclaim the type of biological diversity that once existed. Once you make a species go extinct you can never recover it and in many instances once you cut down a rain forest you can never return it to that region. We've seen that in places like brazil the soil is permanently destroyed after you deforest a region and the trees and plants that once grew there will never be returned. What this means is that deforestation is a problem that will remain a problem forever. You can never undo the damage. We think that you should, in principle, never do something damaging that cannot be undone because you don't know about the future risks. In practice that might not be practical but we think that at the very least it can be mitigated in the short term by implementing sustainable forest management. Our second argument is about protecting communities. So we tell you that millions of people are dependent on forest resources around the world as their primary way of life, and we think that you need to balance the interests of these different groups. Again to return to brazil, there are native people whose ancestors have lived in these forests for thousands of years who are dependent on it for their traditional way of life from medicine, and food, and other resources, but there are also working class brazilians who are dependent on jobs in the forest industry, things like logging and harvesting certain rare plants et cetera. We think that you need to balance the interest of both of these communities and that sustainable forest management is a tool to do so that we can preserve tracts of forest for the people who rely on them for their way of life and also allow some limited harvesting of forest resources to help the economy of these regions. If in fact the other team gets up here and tells you that there are shortcomings and this will hurt halt economic development in countries like brazil, we tell you that in this much as there is already land that has been deforested, that land can be planted with other types of trees besides rain forest trees in order to promote a logging industry that is more sustainable, or more money in research can be put into reforestation that would allow the establishment of plantations and things like that rather than harvesting wild trees and that this would ultimately be the best for all the communities involved. Our third point is about the duty to posterity. The environment doesn't just belong to people who are alive right now. The environment belongs to everybody. We tell you that people who are going to be born in nine months have an equal claim to the rain forest and to other forest resources as you or I, but it doesn't stop there. We think it's arbitrary to say that people who are alive right now have more right to the rain forest than people who will be alive in two hundred years or even two thousand years. We think that the best thing you can do in order to ensure fair use of resources is to use them in a sustainable, moderate way so that future people will be able to access them the way that we've been able to access them. Many times there are resources that we wish still existed today. Things like the great barrier reef that have been heavily damaged by the actions of past generations and that can never be restored and we are filled with regret. We shouldn't pass that on to future generations in the same way. We need to be responsible in how we manage our forest resources and sustainable forest management is the best way to do that. So for these three reasons sustainable forest management brings more good than harm.
We should absolutely increase gun control because first, guns are responsible for hordes of deaths, guns kill and they're incredibly bad. Second, because guns are absolutely unnecessary, and third because you don't have any kind of right to a gun whatsoever, you shouldn't have any kind of right to a gun and guns are awful. So first, why do I think that guns are just like incredibly bad for society? I think that the data and the scientific studies on this like, and the research on this shows that guns clearly lead to more deaths in society when they're more widely available. The reason why like a lot of violence is a lot less extreme in places that have stricter gun controls around the world is because when you have a lot of access to guns, first you're just obviously going to have more people who shouldn't have guns being able to find guns so this gives people who may be like unstable or this could lead to people who are just like bad people being more likely to get a gun, which means that they can just do more damage they can kill more people and that's going to be bad. But I think that additionally, when there's more of a social acceptance of gun when there's more of a social norm of guns existing, and just more people in society have guns, you're going to be more likely seeing people be trigger happy. So you're going to be seeing everyone from like police officers being more likely to shoot people because they're going to be worried about getting shot themselves. There's all other kinds of factors that stem from a proliferation of guns in society. It means that guns are just going to be more likely to be used because guns have more of an acceptance and that people have more of a fear of guns if they don't like use guns themselves. These are like basic things that are reasons why there's so many documented gun deaths in places like the united states. , but there's also like a lot of tragedies like like less are on the broad level and more on the more micro level. There's a lot of specific tragedies or associated with guns as well and this is because on the like more like specific policy level, the way in which gun control like would work is that you can try try to regulate guns to some extent, but whenever someone like has a gun they're able to kill possibly a lot of people very quickly and it can be difficult to respond to that. Because you can't watch everyone, you can't guard everywhere this is just, I mean that's impossible. So it makes it so much easier. When guns are around it makes it so much easier for people to do harm to other people. But the next thing I wanna talk about is about why guns are just simply unnecessary. So, like like there's two reasons why people think guns are important. First because of sports and second because of self defense. So first sport: I think sport is literally a ridiculous excuse. If guns just like cause a lot of harm to people. If they cause a whole lot of people to die in society then that's like a good enough reason to to like ban a sport. That's like, This is ridiculous. So, self defense: maybe a bit more legitimate, it's a shame that it doesn't actually have any kind of semblance of like coherent value whatsoever, and the first reason for that is because you're more likely to like hurt yourself if you have a gun for self defense, you're more likely going to use it in an accident when you should have, or maybe your child is going to use it as in an accident because they get into your gun, or your more likely to like shoot yourself with your gun or things like that, because you may not be able to use it properly, or someone else at your house, there's like a lot of data that shows that you're morally we're going to have like a gun being the source of an accident than actually save anyone. But additionally I also think that like most guns you don't even need for self defense. Like, a lot of guns that you can get, like hunting rifles or like to like likes or like sniper rifles, or like machine guns or even a semi automatic weapon, any of these kinds of guns that like have high capacity magazines that can kill people from far distances or or a lot of people in a concentrated area at once. Like unless you're getting invaded by like a unless your home is getting invaded by a small army, you don't actually need these things for self defense. So, there's also just like this over like hype like this is like this way overpowering of guns that are being allowed to be accessed by people so for all these reasons we should definitely increase gun control.
The insanity plea puts in the hands of a jury a decision that should be in the hands of a trained psychiatrist. What are we talking about in this debate? We do not think that these people should go untreated and unpunished. We think that they should be either treated or punished. We think this decision, however, should not be in the hands of a jury. What do we mean? The court should be making a decision on whether or not this individual is guilty or not guilty, as in did this individual commit or not commit the act attributed to this individual. At a second stage, this individual can appeal to a psychiatrist, at which point the psychiatrist can determine whether or not this individual is psychiatrically responsible for for his actions. At this point, the psychiatrist makes the decision as to whether this person is sent to prison to be punished for their actions, because they do not need psychiatric attention, or to a psychiatric facility to be treated for their condition, because they need assistance. Now we'll make two arguments. A, why not guilty is not an option, and b, who should decide regarding prison verses institutionalize. So first, let's talk about why not guilty is not an option. To be clear, we do not claim that all of these people are guilty, as far as, let's call it, criminally liable. However, we think set free should not be an option, assuming the individual committed the act. What does this mean? Not guilty, in most scenarios, means this person gets to go home. Now, assume for a moment the fact that the individuals we're talking about are those who fact finding determined did in fact commit the act attributed to them, which is usually when you use the insanity plea anyway. Two reasons why these people should not get to go home. A, one of the main jobs of prison is protecting society from people likely to commit a crime again, regardless of if this person is mentally insane in a constant state, or can be driven to mental insanity based on extraneous circumstances, either way, an individual who has committed a crime based on a mental state is likely, more likely than most, to commit that crime again. This means that in order to protect external society, this individual needs to be watched over. Secondly, rehabilitation. One of the main causes for the prison system is to attempt to rehabilitate individuals, so they do not commit crimes again. Now, to be sure, mentally insane people need to be rehabilitated differently than mentally able people. However, they still, and possibly more so, need to be rehabilitated in the form of a mental institution that checks if a, they need psychological help, and b, they need psychiatric help in the form of pills, etcetera. All of this means that when an individual has committed a violent act, a crime, even if they were not cognitively responsible for that act, they need to be treated, they need to be sent to a facility, and going home is not an option. Now the question moves on to be, who should make this decision. Should it be the court the the jury's or should it be psychiatric professionals. At this point we say mental state is substantially more difficult to determine than than guilt versus non-guilt. Why? A, it is internal to the individual, which means that it cannot be based on external facts, the same way criminality can be. B, as are most things medical, it is complicated in such a way that it is determined much better by medical professionals. Imagine if I sat you in front of twelve of your peers and asked them whether or not you had cancer. It is unlikely you would trust their decision making abilities. The same is true for dementia, the same is true for clinical depression. This is a decision that should be made by a mental health professional, and leaving it up to the jury is detrimental both to society and to the individual who is now more likely to go untreated. For all these reasons, abandon the insanity plea.
We should cancel social security tax. Our intention is not to disenable people from opting into social security, it's simply to stop forcing them to do so. Our mechanism is as follows. Things remain quite similar to as they are now. This means that the government regulates social security plans, it means it creates such plans which are advantageous for people who want to spend now in order to save for the future and have money to collect in the future, it means that it incentivizes people to do so by for example, matching whatever it is that you put into social security up to fifteen percent for example, etcetera. The difference is it is an opt in system. It is one which you are not forced to take part in. Three arguments. One, on where the right to taxation comes from and why social security doesn't fall under that governmental right. Two, on individual need to prioritize spending, and three, on a system need for an opt out of that system. So first, let's talk about whether or not this is actually a legitimate tax. Taxation is a form of armed robbery. The state uses its monopoly on power in order to force individuals to pay into the state. That armed robbery needs to be justified in order to be okay. We say is justified for purposes of redistribution, which is to say the state recognizes a need of specific individuals within the state, and therefore forces other individuals to pay for those people in order for them to be able to sustain themselves. Crucially, this is legitimate because the state as an over arching actor is able to recognize needs needs in others where the people who can pay wouldn't be able to do so. We think this logic breaks down at the point at which you're recognizing a need in that same person, which is to say the state may know what is best for the state as a whole better than any individual, but it is far from knowing what is better for every individual better than that same individual. Given that, we think it delegitimizes the state and means that they're not allowed to force such attacks. But even if they were allowed to do so, we think it's a bad idea on two levels. One, we think for the individual there's often a need to prioritize. This is to say oten it is financially wise to spend and risk more now, at the expense of later in order to have more money later. You see this, for example, in starting a business. Is if a person is forced to put away part of the profit from his new business into social security, it means that business is more likely to fail because it has less money less money coming in and less of an economic flow, and that means that person is, of course, doomed to need that social security more, because it failed his business in the first place. We say it is at the individual person's level to decide whether it is more financially wise for him to play it safe or to risk the money now in order to reap gains later, and the government is less predisposed and able to make that decision for him, because he is in the unique situation of knowing both how much he needs that money now, and being responsible for the outcome of the results later if it fails. So for the individual person, he has the right and is better off making that prioritization. Lastly, we say for the system as a whole it is beneficial to have an opt out. The problem with social security is that it's losing money because people are living longer and longer and more and more people are part of the social security system. It cannot afford to sustain itself. We say the more the solve for this is to enable those people who do not need the system to opt out of the system. At the point at which social security doesn't need to pay as many people, we think it can more easily pay into the people who really need it the most. For all these reasons, please propose the motion.
We should raise the corporate tax. So, in the status quo, we're not gonna like argue about numbers exactly, but we would substantially raise the corporate tax rates that currently exist across developed countries. So we don't want to argue, like I said, about that number, but we think that this would be a substantial raise, one that would probably be something like fifty percent to a hundred percent higher than the current rates. All right. So, two main arguments: the first is that we think we need to correct for the wealth disparity that currently exists. In the status quo, a disproportionate amount of wealth has been accumulated by the richest of the rich, while poor and average families have suffered. While productivity has increased tremendously over the last number of decades, median earnings have remained stagnant since approximately the nineteen eighties. This in turn is coupled with a cost of living that is going up, especially in urban centers where jobs are most prevalent. We think that the average worker's simply entitled to a higher take-home of the profits that come into the corporation, but job scarcity and the corporatizing of industry, the fact that one corporation can own any number of different firms and different businesses, has made it easier to drive down wages. The c-level executive a company does not put a hundred times more labor into the day-to-day operations of a business than the average employee does, and the c-level executive is further dependent on those below to create value and actually produce the product that they're going to make money off of. We think that corporate taxes allow for wealth to be redistributed, and this hurts the pockets of the wealthiest far more than it hurts the average worker, because their salary isn't dependent on corporate profits, their take-home bonus isn't dependent on corporate profits, and they are the lifeblood of the corporation, which means it's much easier to cut salaries of, say, a c-level executive who's already making millions upon millions of dollars than it is to cut the salary of every employee across the company in order to pay these higher taxes. We think that you can use that money to create kickbacks for the american worker that can do a tremendous amount of good. First, you can improve infrastructure and provide opportunities at public employment, which means that you can get better jobs and create a more competitive job market. But also with an with additional infrastructure, we think you make innovation and more entrepreneurial entrepreneurship more easily accessible to the average person. You can also increase education to help future generations to ensure that the economic divide does not remain at the level that it is today. And finally, you can just provide lower income tax rates or provide more tax rebates for the average american worker. You don't need to increase the total net sum of taxation and taxable money that's coming in, which means you can put money directly into the pockets of people that are currently being shortchanged in their wages. Secondly, we think it's important for these companies to internalize the harms of their production, and the corporate tax rate does this. In the status quo, corporations rarely have to internalize the full harm of their production. There are two areas where this is most dramatic: environmental damage and pollution is the first. These companies can dump, produce emissions, do all types of things that harm the environment but because those things those prices aren't internalized by them, they're internalized by the the world and the country writ large, they can pass products on to consumers without having any hit to their bottom line, which corporate which raising corporate taxes would do a number would would help reduce the amount that that corporations are currently able to skid by. Second secondarily, corporations in the status quo take short-term risks to please shareholders. They do things like speculate on current economic productivity, and this ultimately leads to economic shocks that affect us all. The reason for the housing crash and the two thousand eight recession was because of corporate speculation and poor corporate practice, yet the dramatic amount of harm that came from that was almost all internalized by the average person, not by the wealthiest off. We think it's we think that raising corporate taxes force companies to internalize those costs ahead of time before that recession happens and secondly, prepares funds for the state for the recession and the recovery spending that is ultimately necessary because of corporate action. For these reasons, we should raise the corporate tax rate.
We should end daylight savings time. So daylight savings time is a practice where during the summer we advance clocks by one hour so that what would normally be nine o'clock in, say, new york city is now ten o'clock. The idea behind it is that it's better to give people more daylight in the afternoon so that they can play sport outside or better take advantage of their free time after work. We think though that this policy should be ended, the policy of having a different time in the summer and winter. Two arguments. The first is that this undermines the purpose of time zones. The foundational idea between having these big time zones is that it ought to be easy to calculate the time difference between any two points. So recognize that two cities in the same time zone. Like say new york city and boston, don't actually have the sun rise at the same time, because boston is further north and further east. But we recognize that it's useful to pretend that they're at the same time in these two cities because they're close together and it makes it easier to do business. And even if you had to cities like say san francisco and new york, that are in different time zones, it's easier to calculate the difference in time between a large time zone on the east coast and one on the west coast of the united states than it would be to say, ' well, in new york city at seven o three and in san francisco it's eight fifteen. So we see that daylight savings time actually makes it harder to calculate this time because not every city and state observes daylight savings time, the rules for its application are inconsistent around the world, and even within some countries like the US and canada. So this actually undermines the idea that it should be easy to calculate time differences. Moreover, daylight savings time is complete the arbitrary, it's not tied to your physical location in the world in the same way that a time zone is, so we think that, yes while it's true that time zones aren't perfect, they would be better without introducing the arbitrary shift of daylight savings, some of the year and not other times, which makes it more difficult to call the entire system sensible. Last thing, we think it makes it more difficult to do business if you change your relative hours compared to other people. So for instance, new york city and singapore are normally twelve hours apart, but if part of the earth are thirteen hours apart, then that makes it so that people are not in the office at the same times relative to one another in say july and november, which probably makes it more difficult to organize long term projects and things like that across international borders, particularly over long distances. And we think that as the world becomes more and more inter connected, this will only be a greater and greater problem. So our advocacy then, our second big point is that it would be better to make it always daylight savings time, at least in most of the world. So first of all, this would solve the idea of uncertainty. We think that if it was always one hour further ahead, then everyone would think of that as the normal, time rather than in an adjusted time, but you would still access all of the benefits of longer days. I think it's probably true that most people, particularly the farther north you move, appreciate having the sun up later. Where I live in boston, the sun goes down at like four PM in december because there's no daylight savings time, and ultimately people will be better able to make use of their free time and travel to and from work if it was always one hour closer. So I think that the issue with daylight savings time is that it is addressing the real problem. It's addressing the idea that the sun and the clock are disconnected in many parts of the world, particularly very far north cities, but the solution to that isn't to have daylight savings just to adjust the time zones so that they actually make sense for these cities this would also end the problem of no inconsistency within countries. Right now, some american states have daylight savings and some don't, so your time relative to say arizona or new mexico might be different during different parts of the year. But if we always knew that boston was half an hour ahead of new york, then you would never have to make any adjustments based on time of year, you would just know it the same way that you know current time zones. So at the end of the day, we think that it would clearly be preferable to just make daylight savings permanent in the sense of having one time zone that's farther ahead, rather than to have it change throughout the year and then have all of the harms of not having daylight savings the rest of the time. So for these reasons, we propose
We should ban genetically modified crops. Genetically modified crops, or GMOs, are largely misunderstood and incredibly problematic tool for feeding our population. Each GMO is, at its most basic level, controlled by a corporation. This has been proven time and time again through legal precedent and through simple domination through the market by large corporations. But even worse than that, we think that feeding our population with tools that are largely misunderstood or science which is largely unproven is incredibly problematic. To that end, we would propose the following model: that in the united states, GMOs should be banned. We're only talking about crops, agriculture, in this debate. We would further say that really simple techniques, such as grafting, are fine, but when you start to get into the million dollar projects, when you start to enter the lab, these kinds of GMOs will be banned. Our first argument is about unproven and unverified science. The vast majority of consumer goods require huge amounts of understanding before they can go to market. We see this with pharmaceuticals. The FDA requires that pharmaceuticals go through multiple rounds of rigorous testing to understand their effects on humans. Unfortunately, GMOs do not have this same kind of rigor. GMOs require incredibly little scientific testing and verification to ensure that there are not side effects on humans. We think that this is incredibly rash and irresponsible. In order to protect our population, is essential that we test GMOs more effectively, but there are a few reasons that this really will not happen. First, we think that there's corporate capture in regulatory agencies. Agricultural organizations and agricultural lobbies in the united states have incredible amounts of power and can prevent things like the FDA from effectively understanding and testing their GMOs. Furthermore, we think that politicians are unlikely to support this kind of bill because individuals will see an increase in price in their food and, as such, they are unlikely to want to put greater tests on these kinds of GMOs in fear that it might affect their election chances. To this end, we think that the only way to truly protect our populace, without having to depend on inherently partisan politicians, is to outright ban genetically modified crops. Now my second argument is about corporate domination. We see this with companies like monsanto all the time. When large corporations patent genetically modified crops, farmers are unable to replant their seeds, they're unable to cultivate their own breeds and their own strains for resale and, largely, they lose a massive amount of autonomy that they enjoyed before. This is incredibly problematic as it, first, increases the cost of our foods which we think is always reflected on the ultimate price that goes onto the consumer, but second, destroys farmer autonomy. One of the reasons that agriculture has boomed over the last millennia is because we've been able to cultivate the best crops possible. Putting this into the hands of a corporation creates a monopoly, and creates incredibly little incentive for them to meaningfully change. My third and final argument is about pesticides and harmful chemicals. Genetically modified crops are largely based on avoiding the harms of pesticides. It allows us to spray horrific chemicals on our crops without them dying. We think that many individuals do not wash their crops, do not understand the implications of what happens when the crops are sprayed with these chemicals and, as such, suffer as a result. For this reason, we should ban genetically modified crops.
We should prohibit tower blocs. Although tower blocks seem like a good choice for lower income families their poor upkeep and their shoddy make makes them very very dangerous. The grenfell tower demonstrates that tower blocks will always be a problematic choice for lower income families. However given that they live under the constant threat of running out of money they will regularly take the choice putting them and their family at risk. Because of this we support the following model that tower blocks around the world be removed that individuals be given one year to vacate them and then they should be destroyed for other use in the community. Two arguments to support this model and motion. First tower blocks are dangerous tower blocks are usually poorly made government contracts go out to the the cheapest contractor and when individuals know that these departments have to cater to low income families there's little incentive to make them as nice as possible. The reason that there's this cost ceiling which exists is because living in such tight quarters with a variety of other families means that wealthier individuals or and will never pay a high cost for the rooms. This means that contractors can get away with making the rooms very poorly and making the building unsafe as a whole. Additionally though they're unlikely to have good upkeep. Rent controls used on these apartments and when landlords know that individuals will be forced to take the apartment regardless of the quality it will not spend money to on upkeep meaning that people who live in the house will have a poor quality of life and will incur a variety of the cost upon themselves in order to make the apartment livable in the long term making it more expensive than what wealthier people could find another neighborhood. Additionally though escape is incredibly difficult from tower blocks. If a fire does occur it's very difficult to climb from say the thirty fifth bill tower of a building particularly when fire escapes are simply not made to go that low. The poor upkeep the poor make the difficulty of escape makes them a death trap for individuals who move in. When poor individuals are the only individuals who take these rooms we are violating a reciprocal obligation to keep these people safe. Poor individuals are largely poor because of societal factors. It's because a history of oppression from wealthy individuals and a history of poor financial maintenance from individual's families. This means that the harms put upon them by tower blocks are no way their own fault and as such the government has an obligation to protect these individuals. The second argument we'd like to make though is that this leads to an unhealthy urban density. This over strains the location and makes it far more difficult for people to live effectively. Things like hospitals in the area will be pushed to the max to their maximum capacity by these tower blocks in the area things like roads things like a police officer things like schools will be full to the brim due to these tower blocks. There's a huge incentive to build multiple tower blocks very close to one another because once an area has already been made lower income due to these tower blocs you can build more in the area for cheap. This puts even further strain on public resources making it difficult for people to live effectively. Government has an obligation to maintain these public resources and as such cannot allow tower blocks to remain. Additionally though broken windows theory shows this that tower blocks lead toward crime. In areas that are perceived as lower income that are perceived as having worse upkeep crime is far more likely simply from a societal perspective. Individuals see the area as less safe and will understand that they can commit crime more easily. As such more crime will occur against lower income families if they live in a tower block. Because they're unjust and because they represent a costly choice we should prohibit tower blocks.
We should introduce a smoking ban. By this we mean that we should ban smoking completely in our cities. We think that there are many reasons why this is the case but primarily it has to do with the obligation of the government to protect its citizens. So in this speech I'm going to talk a lot about paternalism and why it applies in this instance. So first of all, let's talk about secondhand smoke. We think that the most important time for the government to limit individual's freedom is when an individual is harming a third party. So it's one thing to let people destroy their own lives, although we'll talk about that in just a minute, but secondhand smoke can actually give people who don't smoke themselves lung cancer and this has been an increasingly large problem in the past especially with children growing up around parents that smoke. We think it's clear that the government needs to step in when an individual's freedom is being violated and given that we assume people have a right to bodily autonomy and to good health, it's clear that the rights of someone who gets cancer from secondhand smoke or gets ill from secondhand smoke are being violated by the person who is smoking their cigarettes. A useful metaphor to think about here is that your right to swing your fist ends where another person's face begins. Well here your right to choose what you put in consume in your body ultimately ends when what you consumer or what you put in your body harms other people. Now the other side might say that people can smoke in their apartment or in their house and not hurt anyone else, but the fact of the matter remains that nobody actually smokes in that way. Everyone who goes out and goes to bars or has a job is going to have to smoke away from their house and that means that cigarette smoke is going to be exposed to people who don't smoke and who don't want to get cancer but are being affected by it through no fault of their own. We think that this is a pretty compelling case for why the government needs to get involved to ban smoking and our second argument is about why the government should limit what individuals are allowed to do for their own sake. We posit that no rational individual would choose to smoke in other words, if someone just sat down and tried to make a decision no one would ever choose to smoke. People only begin because of outside pressure or because they're not able to make a good decision. I think this is why if you ask people when did you start smoking a lot of people that I know and probably that you know as well say they started smoking because they were drinking and they started smoking whenever they would drink and then gradually they started smoking more and more when they weren't drinking until eventually they became a smoker and what we can take away from this is that one of the most common pathways for someone to become a smoker is to be unable to make a good decision because they're drunk and then to be put in an environment where lots of people are smoking like a bar. We think that the government needs to intervene to protect people from themselves when they can't make a good decision. In the same way that we don't let drunk people enter into contracts or make permanent decisions that affect their lives, we also probably shouldn't let them make a decision that affects their lives forever like becoming addicted to nicotine and the other side might say well plenty of people smoke who don't drink but those people probably live in cultures where cigarette smoking is normal and where there's a cultural pressure on them to smoke. So even though smoking is very common in egypt and relatively few people drink for religious reasons, it's also a culture that encourages people to smoke that doesn't exist as much in the united states. But we still think that that's coercive, right? That if people are being pressured by their family and their friends to do something unhealthy, that they're not really able to make an unbiased decision but rather an emotional one. So we think that people are being coerced or are being put into a position where they can't freely choose and therefore that it's justified for the government to get involved and to limit individual's freedom. So for these two reasons, we should introduce a smoking ban because of the harms to individuals and to third parties. Thank you.
Single-sex schools bring more harm than good because they're an incredibly valuable resource for empowering women. They empower women, firstly, by creating academic role models, symbolic role models and just generally being icons of the achievements of women. And secondarily, they also work more directly in empowering women in society and in their classrooms. So, before we get into those arguments, let's talk about how we actually look at this context thing. Obviously we're going to defend that single-sex schools bring more good than harm. However, this does not necessarily mean that this should be exclusively one system or the other. We think that it's important to have a hybrid of both systems and that individual women should choose to go to have the ability to choose to go to single-sex schools if they feel that that is a a better fit for them. So, first let's talk about symbols and role models. It's obvious that oftentimes when you look at a single-sex school, schools like wellesley or smith or mount holyoke, you look at schools that produce powerful female role models. For example, hillary clinton was is an alumni of of wellesley. And this is very important because when you have a powerful female academic, powerful female businesspeople, lawyers, politicians, that are able to thrive as a result of these environments they came from, this is very important for inspiring and encouraging women to actually get involved in certain things. Because oftentimes women are told by society that certain occupations are not necessarily for them, that they should be pushed away from certain things, whether it's like stem research or or politics or things like that. It's very important to make sure you have female role models so that women feel more comfortable and empowered so they can go into these fields. But additionally, it's also important that you look at what these school what single-sex schools produce us as academic work. Because when you look at feminism as an ideology, a whole lot of the contributions to the field, scholarly contributions to the field and also practical contributions to the field, such as like organizing people who are involved in organizing, people who are involved in like fundraising or operations or outreach, things like that, a lot of these people oftentimes come from single-sex schools, and a lot of work for advancing feminism comes out of single-sex schools. So it's very important to make sure that we're that we are empowering this progress to continue because feminism is quite an important thing that we need to make sure that we keep defending. This is also additionally important this entire symbolic context, because symbols are incredibly important in society. When you think about the confederate flag in the united states, for example. As a symbol it doesn't harm any it doesn't exactly cause like physical harm to people. But as a symbol it's important because it's a representation of the continued oppression of african americans in society. This is in many ways similar for single-sex schools because while even if we're not able to show that they achieve like a practical or tangible support, although I already think that we have done so, they're immensely important for the symbolic aspects of the way in which they empower women. So, next, let's talk about some of the ways in which single-sex schools directly empower women. There is a concept that's oftentimes called the confidence gap, in which women feel less confident or comfortable expressing a lot of their opinions, particularly when they're in the presence of men who are often times much more comfortable expressing their opinions. So in order to combat this, single-sex schools can oftentimes be a very good solution to this problem. Because in single-sex classrooms, when you have all women, you're going to have women that are going to be feeling more comfortable contributing in class, contributing work, and all of those kinds of things are gonna be good. But additionally, it's also important to recognize that single-sex classrooms and schools are more likely to be less biased against women because when you look at women's academic achievements and performance in comparison to women, especially when it can come to like presentations or speaking or competitive spots on a team or things like that, oftentimes women are more likely to get their contributions are more likely to get undervalued, and this is something that's less likely to happen when they come from a single-sex school. And all of this in turn makes it more likely that women will be high-achieving and therefore more likely to achieve later in life, which ultimately corrects a lot of systemic imbalance in society. So for all of those reasons, single-sex schools do more harm than good.
Patriotism definitely does more harm than good, for two big reasons: first, because patriotism as an ideology leads to people enacting far more oppressive, and worse off, policies, and secondarily, because patriotism makes it more difficult to even critique the validity, or benefits, or cost of these policies itself. So let's break all that down. First, let's talk about the policies themselves, and why I think that patriotism fosters a lot of that policies. The reason why it does this is because patriotism creates almost an idea of in group supremacy, it creates like this pathological support for your own nation, for your own government, it puts the values that you try like uniquely possess on a pedestal, and it necessarily oftentimes portrays this in contrast to other cultures, or other nations, or other values, and it also necessarily creates a system, where there's an us versus them dichotomy. So, I think that this is really important, because what it does is it creates things like more animosity towards like say, free trade, or more animosity towards immigration policy, or more of a willingness to declare war. All of these things are obviously very bad for different reasons. But I also think that it also has, in addition to those more like international impacts, like the way in which you can harm other people, by discriminating against like hispanics because of immigration, or things like that. It also has a problematic domestic nature as well, and I think that the reason for that is because patriotism results in a skew of spending priorities. What it does is, instead of seeing spending on, maybe, things like healthcare being prioritized, you're more likely to see, because of a patriotic ideology, more likely to see government money going towards things like the military, or war, or like crime prevention, or any of the other kinds of things, that are more traditionally associated with patriotism, or with like like american ideology, and that's very important, because this hurts a lot of people, it hurts a lot of people when we're willing to spend more money on war, than on things like healthcare or education. But the second area of debate I want to discuss is that, patriotism makes it harder to critique policy itself, and it makes it harder to critique policy, because, what it lets you do is it lets you dismiss the complaints that people bring up about your policies as simply anti american. What it does, is it creates a way for you to use scare tactics, or anti american sentiment, in order to just eliminate dissent. So, what would be like an example of this illustrate the principle of this? You could be saying that like, if you're like anti war, because you think the war is unjust, or because like you're hurting other people, or things like that, it's very easy for someone to say like: you're soft on war, you're soft on defense, you're soft on this or that, or even more perniciously: do you want the russians to get an advantage? Do you want mexico to get an advantage? Or china or whatever x country is, that's like very very bad, because what it does is it diminishes the value of the concerns on face. It doesn't let you actually discuss: you know what? Maybe we shouldn't be doing this thing, this money could be better spent elsewhere, things like that. It diminishes the actual value of the discussion in the discourse, and essentially makes it like this like impossible discussion, about who's more american, who's better in line with these arbitrary values. So, I think that that's also like very very bad. And, that means they are less likely going to actually get the better policies being enacted. So for all those reasons, because patriotism leads to worse policies, and because patriotism means you're going to be less likely to try to critique those policies, very proud to propose that, it does more harm than good.
The motion for today's debate is that we should and water fluoridation. I think an important overview here is to recognize that people are going to be able to get fluoride regardless of whether or not it is within our water. Because the majority of like name brand toothpastes, and those that are most recommended by dentists, are those that have fluoride in them. This means that we don't have to defend a world in which fluoride is never taken up by an individual and never does anything beneficial. We just have to defend a world in which water specifically is not used as the mechanism by which individuals end up using fluoride. Two main areas of clash: first on being risk averse. Recognize that for something that is so widely spread water fluoridation has been surprisingly under researched. Fluoride as a like molecule is potentially dangerous given that it is a halogen which is highly reactive and very like known for heavy metal damages. As such and also known to like act as a free radical. We have no idea what the long term breakdown of fluoride in the body might look like or how it might interact with other compounds in the human body, given that the human body is actually surprisingly reactive and has a lot of like individual chemicals in it that could be dangerous. We think that it's much safer to allow fluoride to be used through toothpaste, which doesn't get fully ingested, as opposed to water where it has to like go through your whole digestive tract and actually be internalized by the body. The problem with water is that no one actually gets to consent in or out of fluoride being there. The government just decides that it's a good thing and that imposes its will upon individuals. The problem here is that we think that people need to be able to have an opt in and opt out mechanism into things that go into their bodies. This is why we might be pro things like genetically modified food labeling. But like even to a lesser extent, I think this is why we often require things like organic food labeling. Or like specific pesticides to be labeled. Because we recognize that the body is something that is specifically sacred to individuals, specifically something that individuals have full control over, that the government ought not impede upon. And so it should be in individual's right to choose whether or not they're going to hove fluoride as part of their diet. I think the problem in the status quo is that you can always like choose non fluoridated toothpaste regardless of how much of a bad idea it is, but it is completely impossible to opt out the water that you drink insofar as it is necessary to ensure your survival. And so we think that because people never get to like choose not to do it, unless they're going to buy all of their own bottled water which is incredibly expensive, we think that you have to end water fluoridation. But our second area of clash is about cost. Because the government spends a lot of money on something that people are going to buy on their own. This makes this a frivolous expenditure that ought not be incurred. We think that literally anything could be better spent on than something like fluoridation. I think there's necessarily a like hierarchy of government obligation and of individual rights that need to be upheld upheld. And I just don't understand in what world it is so important for individuals to have fluoridated toothpaste that it would be necessary and that the government ought be fulfilling them. I think rather, is infinitely more important that individuals get things like food and get things like shelter and so we think that money would like should instead go in that direction. But I think the more important thing here is that in so far as individuals are going to be able to access fluoride either way, we don't think the government has an obligation to be providing it and certainly that it shouldn't be violating a lot of individuals' rights by never giving them a chance to opt out of that system. For these reasons proud to propose.
We should ban abortions. When we're talking about abortions in this debate we're going to keep out two exceptions in which we would not ban abortions but we think this is for principled reasons. Firstly in instances of rape. We don't think that a woman should be forced to carry the product of a crime that has been committed against her and in those instances we would allow for abortion. And secondly, in the instance of a risk to the mother's life, in that instance we again think it is not fair to force a woman to use her own body to bring about the end of her own life and in those instances we think an unreasonable expectation is placed on the woman that would force her to carry a child to term. But aside from those two instances we think that we should ban abortion. So why should we care about the fetus itself and why should we think of this thing as a life? Well, we think that the best way in which we can conceptual rights, conceptualize rights is a framework in which all human beings are included, but we think you need a principal justifications for this and the best principle justification for this is one that relies solely on the biological fact that you are a human being, that is in your DNA that you are a human. The reason for this, as opposed to other systems, is because other systems are suspect to abuse. This is because if you rely on someone's inclusion in the political community, then vast amounts of people can be excluded and harmed in a variety of ways, through either political or non political means. If you use it through the ability of someone to express their preferences or the ability of someone to express human traits, then we think that you exclude large numbers of any community as well such as infants or children or coma patients who aren't fully able to express their part in the political or social community, and in those instances we think that you can get a large amount of rights violations that occur. So we think that the best in any number of ways. So we think that the best way to conceptualize rights is one in which all human beings are given full creed and space solely on the fact that they are a human. Given that this is the case, we don't think that you should exclude fetuses from the definition of what it is to be human. The reason for this is that we think we value potentiality all the time and just because someone just because that potential is in the form of the fetus we shouldn't stop following it now. What we mean by this is when we passed laws and we set up a society, we set one up in a sense that we try to plan and protect the future of our society in the future, progeny of that society, we try to set up institutions that will last beyond our own years, we try in many instances to fight things like global warming which pose existential threats to our race and our species, and in those instances we clearly show that we value the potentiality of those people. So we don't think that we should otherwise void that potentiality once it becomes more potential in the form of a physical embodiment that could otherwise become life if not impeded. So why do we think further that we should give preference to the life of the fetus over the mother's autonomy and decision to make a choice? Because we think that the fetus in this instance has no ability to advocate for itself. It is no it has made no decision that brought it into the place in which it could be aborted or could be alive and because it is not able to fully advocate for itself, we think that we should, because we overwhelmingly value life in the status quo as a measurement of good and utility we think that we should then defer to that in this instance as well in which, because the disutility to the mother of having to carry a child may be incredibly high, we think that we should do of wide variety of things like provide better access to contraceptives and better birth control methods and try to get better education to prevent further unwanted pregnancies, but once someone has made the free choice with the knowing risk that sexual intercourse could occur with a pregnancy and that could be something that happens, we think that given that to violate that child's, to abort that pregnancy is to violate the potentiality of that child, and put out life that otherwise we would have valued, if not for that instance. We think that because of our duty to protect our progeny, that we have fully expressed in how we construct society and because that progeny has no ability to advocate for for itself in our legal systems in our society, we should ban abortions to ensure that they are protected.
The harms and benefits of water fluoridation are clear cut. What are they? The harms are, a, the economic costs. It costs money to fluoridate the water and the government is currently paying that bill. And b potential of over fluoridation, meaning people who ensure to brush their teeth every day and get fluoride from that and other topical treatments are also drinking this water and they may be exposed to more fluoride than is recommended. The benefits are also clear. Ensured fluoride exposure to everyone. Everyone gets the amount that they need, at least. Let's compare those two. The first point of comparative is going to be on the extent of damage by lack of fluoride versus the extent of damage of too much. The second one is going to be on the financial costs and on the government's responsibility to bear them. Let's talk about the comparative harms. So not having fluoride means massive tooth problems. It means tooth decay, it means cavities, it means root canals. All of these are things that are, a, massively painful to the individuals, b, of great financial harm because they cost a lot of money to fix and c often not even repairable. So as far as how they feel or how they look they're quite bad for the individual. Compare that to over too much fluoride exposure. You get unclear harms wherein there is minor deformation of the teeth in a way that is neither noticeable visually nor painful nor problematic for the use of teeth when it comes to chewing etcetera. So it may be true that there is a limit to which fluoride is good for you and passing that limit is no longer good for you but we say it's not particularly bad for you. Certainly when compared to not having enough of it. Fluoridating the water ensures that everyone has at least enough of it and we think that is a much greater benefit to those who wouldn't otherwise have enough, then it is a harm to those who now have too much. Secondly let's talk about financial harms and covering those costs. So we think fluoride costs less than a lack thereof. Why? Take a look at the groups most likely to otherwise not have enough fluoride. Those groups are a the financially disadvantaged, those who for reasons of time, of money, or even of education, are less likely to be able to get the topical treatments on a day to day basis in the quantity necessary. And b, children. Kids who just haven't figured out yet that brushing their teeth is really important and are busy looking for ways to convince their parents that they brush their teeth even though they haven't really. Both of these are groups whose dental expenses fall largely on governments. This means that the cost needs to be compared to that of filling cavities, of doing root canals, etcetera. We think those costs are much much greater. So for all these reasons please fluoridate the water.
We should limit the right of self defense because people are incredibly bad actually evaluating real danger and making good decisions that are good for preventing death and injury and this reality gets in the way of ultimate in acting your ideals of justice as a just society making sure that due process is followed and all these kinds of things. So let's start by talking about why you need to limit the right to self defense because in the status quo in a lot of places self defense is given an incredibly wide degree of latitude. It's very easy to claim self defense to get out of a lot of crimes especially throughout america and especially throughout the american south and I think that that's very important because people aren't very good at actually evaluating threats and there's a lot of reasons for this. First and foremost of those is racism. A lot of people because people grow up in a society where you're constantly being told that like muslims are terrorists, that black people present threats to you and things like that, that you're more likely to impose threats on to other people even if they don't exist and examples of this are really obvious especially in america where you see police killing unarmed black people on a regular basis and these are trained professionals, these are police officers. Now imagine the average individual who doesn't even have police training and isn't even trained at isn't even supposed to be trained in de-escalating situations or being better able to actually identify the degree of a threat level. So I think that most people are going to assume that the threat may be higher. I think that secondarily oftentimes people are going to be very fearful and uniquely illogical in a situation where self defense may be necessary because if you think that there may be a danger to you or somebody else around you you're going to be very likely to act quickly without thinking especially if you have a weapon on you or something like that and I think that's very bad because it can lead to a rash decision making. Rash decision making that could lead to you injuring somebody who didn't deserve to be injured, leading to you injuring yourself because you escalated the situation. Maybe it was a robbery and obviously robberies are bad but a robbery is worse if the person robbing you ends up shooting you because you try to fight back or things like that. There's all kinds of reasons why I think that like limiting the right of self defense will make it so that maybe people are going to be more likely to instead of trying to fight maybe the emphasis can be on calling for help or fleeing or a duty to de-escalate. But additionally I think that the inexperience and lack of qualification is uniquely important because in addition to just like the racism point, you're talking about people who could come from like a wide range of backgrounds and qualification and things like that and most people don't have any kind of training in de-escalation, don't have any kind of training in actually understanding conflicts and threat levels. So all of that is very important because it prevents the ideals of justice in a just society from being enacted and the reason for that is because in a just society you're innocent until proven guilty and if in the act of self defense or crime if maybe like there's a robbery going on the robber gets shot, obviously that person is still committing a crime but the like punishment for robbery isn't like roadside execution by a random person society. We still have due process checks. We still believe that guilt isn't just that you commit a crime but it's going through a series of procedures to actually establish guilt and additionally there's also the principle of proportionality where it's important to make sure that the punishment is proportional to the crime. That's why we have things like laws and all these kinds of legal checks in the first place to make sure that the criminal defense system and the justice system are fair systems and those require that self defense and individual citizen actions are done in the most minimal form possible. So for all of those reasons, we should absolutely limit the right of self defense.
We should ban cosmetic surgery. We're at the very beginning we're just going to differentiate between cosmetic surgery being surgery that's done specifically and only for the enhancement of one's appearance, and reconstructive surgery which is a type of cosmetic surgery to repair scarring or other types of things that occur after someone's been injured or harmed in some particular manner. We think that we should ban cosmetic surgery specifically because its existence perpetuates and allows the continuation of bad norms. What are we talking about when we mean bad norms? We think that cosmetic surgery first perpetuates the idea that there is some sort of idealized human form that individuals should strive to achieve. Cosmetic surgery exists to do certain things to change an individual's appearance, and these types of things fall in line of very specific types of gender norms and body norms that exist in society today. For example, the idea of having your facelift so that you have fewer wrinkles, or other things done to your face to make oneself look younger, and to make oneself look as if they were as if they were more naturally gifted. What does this mean and what is the problem with that? It means that individuals who exist in the normal world where they have bodies that aren't in this idealized form, which is the vast majority of individuals, feel ostracized within their society and feel that either a, they need to do this type of thing where they spend a vast amount of money on cosmetic surgery that isn't necessary in order to appear a specific way, which we ultimately don't think is going to make individuals feel any better about themselves, because this idea of an idealized form is something that we believe is simply unachievable, that once individuals find flaws within themselves and find this nagging need to fix those small flaws that they see, individuals are going to perpetually see those flaws, and we can bet cosmetic surgery is a route by which individuals can abuse themselves by correcting flaws that are simply not flaws in the first place. We think when you ban cosmetic surgery you remove this type of idealized form, maybe not in the imaginary of individuals immediately, but we think what you do is you make it more difficult for individuals to change their appearance and more difficult for society to perpetuate this idea, especially in the higher classes of an idealized form and what that form is particularly, and we think that this is especially problematic issues for young people and for specifically young girls who already are feeling immense pressure about how their bodies need to appear through things like beauty magazines and other sorts of societal norms that are pushed on to these individuals. We think that these people are specifically prone and specifically likely to be pushed into doing these types of things and taking drastic moves to change their appearance, which we think is something that is not acceptable within our society. We think that when people at a young age are made make themselves feel as if they are lesser because of how they appear it leads to a whole sort of issues such as body dysmorphia and other eating disorders that occur when individuals think that their body is not the ideal form it leads to self harm and to depression when individuals can't feel like they're safe, or that their okay in their own skin, and we can bet cosmetic surgery, and the cult around cosmetic surgery, the social norms that surround cosmetic surgery, this idealized form that comes with it, we think that that type of problem is ultimately what leads to these things in our society and leads to a greater impact of the social norms that we have in the status quo. Finally, we think that the idea that you can simply change the way you appear leads to types of body shaming against people, firstly against overweight people who are seen as those that are too lazy to change how they feel or don't care about how they feel or don't care about how they look, and we think that this type of body shaming is increased when you have things such as cosmetic surgery to change things, to tuck your tummy, to change how fat you look, all of those types of things. We think that body shaming and these types of norms are particularly perpetuated through cosmetic surgery because it gives an avenue or a purported avenue to change the way you feel, and puts the onus on individuals to change the way they appear or to fall in line with those norms, rather than the onus on society to accept that these norms don't exist, and for these reasons, we think that you should ban cosmetic surgery.
We should legalize sex selection. At the beginning of this debate, it's important to recognize that the reasons that someone would choose to have an abortion because of the sex of their child, or would choose to, prior to being pregnant trying to select the sex of their child, the reasons for this are wide and varied, and we think that many of these are culturally dependent and built into the ways in which people have been raised over the course of their entire lives. So recognizing it at the beginning in this debate, it's incredibly difficult to change the mentality that these people have, and to change the culture that drives people to having the sort of abortions or doing the sort of procedures. So, that is crucial to recognize at the very start. Given that that is the case, we think there are two reasons that you should legalize sex selection. The first is about bodily autonomy, and the second is a bit about how the lives of these children if this isn't passed, or if this legislation or if this legalization doesn't happen, why the lives of children that are going to be born are going to be on net worse. Okay. Two things. First, bodily autonomy. We think that anyone that is pregnant has the right to abort that pregnancy at any given moment due to their claim to bodily autonomy. We think that bodily autonomy is the most important right that an individual has, because it is the prior right to the access of any other rights. What I mean by this is that in order to access your rights to freedom of speech, to mobility, to access to economic capital, any of these sorts of things, what is required prior to that is the right to bodily autonomy. And we think that, because this individual is currently able to access that right and not only access that right, but because this individual compared to the fetus, has a much higher claim to that right, because they are a cognizant of the fact that their rights exist because they're able to act upon those rights because they have been afforded those rights for sometime, and because for for many reasons the fetus up to a point of viability simply cannot be weighed in the same sense as the mother can. So we think that, for, we think that bodily autonomy is necessary to access all of these other rights and to force women to go through these births when they don't want to because of the gender of their child, is problematic. But, from there it's important to think about what happens if these abortions or if these procedures are not allowed. We think that what's likely to happen is that, two major things. First, we think this child might be abandonned, which is , a horrible fate to happen to a child. This can happen either if this child being forced into an orphanage or something like that into a state that is likely not very good, somewhere where they're unlikely to get the education and the sort of foundational building of their life that allows them to be successful in the future, but also an environment that is likely to tell them that they're unwanted. If they're not abandoned, or in some cases killed, what's likely to happen is this person is going to take this child into their house without really wanting this child, you think what comes from this is first fueling anger towards this child, the feeling that this child is to blame for the fact that they didn't get the gender of child that they want, that this child is lesser than what they otherwise could have had, and we think that putting blame and putting anger towards this child is likely going to give them a life that is problematic, that sets them down a path where they're unlikely to be happy moving into the future. Recognize how foundational parents and upbringing are to future happiness in an individual. We don't think that life is by de facto, oh claim a good thing to have. We don't think that life is always going to be enjoyable for the person experiencing that life. And we think that, a reason that this can happen, a reason that someone could have an on net disutile life, is because of those foundational things that a parent presents and raises their child believing. If a child is raised in a household where they're said they're to blame for all the agony and all the pain that the mother had to go through, if they're blamed for the fact that they are not a boy and, or rather a girl, or for any of these types of things, if they're constantly belittled because of their gender, we think that these are things that are very likely to happen when the anger that occurs in these people who are not allowed to get abortions happens, and from there we think it's very likely that these people are going to live much less utile lives than otherwise, they than otherwise an alternative child if this legislation were to pass could have had. And because of this, we think it is necessary to legalize sex selection
We should end the use of agricultural subsidies. Agricultural subsidies are simply the american taxpayer paying so that individuals in other countries can pay less. In a globalized world where we consistently compete for the lowest prices subsidies may seem good however, we compete for the lowest prices so that we can offer these goods the most efficient as possible. If we artificially decrease that price, ultimately we're simply wasting money on other people's consumption. With that in mind, I would propose the following model: that all US subsidies going to farms be removed, that we no longer subsidize corn or any other crop, and that the only subsidies that go to these individuals are ones which allow them to buy technology cheaper or otherwise allow them to install irrigation cheaper so that individuals in poverty can access them more easily rather than subsidizing individual crops. Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first, we are currently subsidizing foreign consumption. Milton friedman once said that any country which exports a good that it subsidizes is charging its own citizens to export that good. It is taxing individuals in the country to pay for foreign consumption. The reason this is is that if I pay an extra five cents for every tomato that's grown, ultimately that decreases the price for all people. If I buy tomatoes the total result will be that I really don't pay anything extra because I get that tax money off at the counter when I'm actually purchasing these goods. However, if we ship these overseas I'm simply allowing someone in a foreign country to take my tax money for no real reason. This is ultimately a terrible policy. If another country can do it more cheaply that's great. We can import their goods and we'll pay a similar amount as we pay now. But we'd also be saving the tax dollars ultimately saving the american people a massive amount of money. My second argument is that the amount of food that we produce in the status quo means that we waste incredible amounts as well. There's only so much that we can export. The vast majority of food that we produce is ultimately just thrown in the trash as it rots away and is never consumed. This is endemic of a system which is massively overproducing. In a capitalist system the major incentive to continue producing especially at a massive surplus are subsidies or massive amounts of profit. It's clear that farmers are making far too much money despite the fact that a massive amount of their products aren't even being sold. As such, we think that removing the subsidy will ultimately make it so individuals produce less and as a result we waste considerably less as well. What we can do with this now is we can a, make it so we simply produce the correct amount which means that they'll be less global warming as we won't be overproducing which causes COTwo to go into the atmosphere, it means that we'll also use so much less effort picking foods, harvesting foods that ultimately will never be consumed. The total amount of energy that we can save both in terms of global warming and in terms of individual hours worked will improve the US economy an incredible amount while also improving people's health. My third and final argument is that farmers have undue political power. The number of people in the US who are farmers numbers around two percent however, they have an incredible amount of power in terms of lobbying. The reason why is first, these subsidies give them a huge amount of money that they can pump into politics but also these subsidies give them an impetus for investing a massive amount of money into politics to ensure that these subsidies continue to exist. By getting rid of this rallying cry, by getting rid of this central organizing figure we get rid of a strong block of farmers who ultimately act undemocratically. For this reason, we should end the use of agricultural subsidies.
We should disband nasa. Although I will sing the praises of nasa throughout my entire life, their hegemony in the space industry has ended. Nasa was essential when the market could not create rockets or create other goods which would send humans into space. However, in the modern day, nasa is no longer necessary. Not only is it not necessary, but it crowds out other private investment which would otherwise improve our space system in a very substantial way. It has been proven by corporations such as space_x and mining corporations that space development is both profitable and popular in the status quo. As such, we would support the following model: that nasa is immediately disbanded, that all individuals who worked on nasa be given some sort of initial compensation, and that all data which nasa created be released to the public. There will be a subsidy for the production of goods which can be used for space travel and space development, and when individuals utilize that subsidy, they will be unable to get patents on technology which would otherwise be used to improve the quality of life of all people. With that in mind, we have two arguments: first, on market effects. We think that nasa crowds out private investment. Yes, space_x can exist. Yes, a few other private space corporations have sprung up, but we think that nasa largely depresses this industry for a few reasons. First, nasa is essentially working with no cost at all. Every single cost from nasa is internalized by the public. Every single dollar they spend is does not come out of their budget, but comes out of tax dollars put in place by congress. This means that every corporation who competes against them must spend their income on actually producing these sort of rockets, while nasa can produce them at effectively no cost. This is incredibly problematic as nasa will always be a couple steps ahead of private corporations, as these private corporations cannot get private investment. We think that they can that these private corporations can shoot ahead if the private industry is able to get involved, but no investor wants to take the risk in investing in a private corporation where the government has previously had a monopoly. We believe that if nasa pulls back, private investors can push into this market increasing the total amount of competition and increasing the amount of money that goes into this market, creating a new system where these corporations can spend money at a far greater amount than nasa has in the status quo. The second problematic market effect is simply that nasa is less effective than private corporations. They cannot get as far, they do not have as much ingenuity, they don't have the as large of a budget as much of these corporations and as such, they will never produce products that are quite as good as things like space_x. The third problem is the idea of brain drain. We think that nasa attracts some of the most intelligent people in our nation. Unfortunately, congress has given them a tiny, tiny budget and very few resources, which means that smart people are sitting around trying to make rockets out of terrible materials and necessarily decreasing the goals of our space program. We believe that if nasa dispands, these individuals can go to private corporations where they will find greater support and greater pools of money to create effective rockets and necessarily travel and development. My second argument is on the role of government. We believe that government must represent the democratic will of the people. Unfortunately, nasa is not that popular in the status quo. Yes, individuals like nasa in theory, but every time you ask should we be spending more on space exploration, they will say no. The problems in our country right now mean that the government should not be funding a program which many individuals find unpopular. As such, we believe nasa should be disbanded simply to reflect the will of the people. Refusal to do so would create make an unjust government, which is necessarily violating its democratic obligations. As such, we should disband nasa.
We should introduce goal-line technology. Goal-line technology is technology which allows us to very accurately see when a ball has gone over a line. Although this has very few applications in sports, it is incredibly valuable as it replaces the subjectivity of a ref and the angles at a ref suffers from and uses the laser-like precision of lasers and computers. It will largely increase the fairness of the game, save time on referee calls, and reduce total intervention. We believe each of these will contribute massively to a more enjoyable experience for players, for viewers, and for referees. My first argument is about fairness. We believe that the game is more valuable when it is more fair. When two individuals compete, it is a competition of their skill and natural ability. If two individuals are inherently mismatched for instance someone who's eight feet tall and versus someone who's two feet tall in basketball we think that that is not the kind of fairness that we truly care about. If someone has to play with lead shoes the entire time and someone doesn't that the mechanical unfairness the unfairness which no one consented to and no one understands is the kind that makes people angry. Particularly when that unfairness is truly random, individuals are very very unhappy. Goal-line technology increases fairness as it has no bias whatsoever. Individuals may feel that someone has been called too often are called too little or maybe just staring off into the distance when a bad play is made or when a bad call is made. This is inherently problematic as it will lead to unfair situations where a singular team or individual is targeted more or less by a ref due to no one's actions but these inherent and subconscious biases of the ref. By improving fairness we improve the quality of the game for all individuals. My second argument is that it will save huge amounts of time. When refs have to go through replays eight nine ten times simply to try to find the truth it wastes everyone's time. It is very problematic when individuals cannot play the game when there is ad after ad after ad simply because referees want to review videos that they think they can find some additional information from. Goal-line technology reduces this time wasting activity given that it can tell you without a doubt whether the ball passed a line or did not. My third argument is that it reduces referee intervention. We think that referees can decide incredibly important games or even less important games but everytime they do it reduces the value of that game. This is incredibly problematic when it occurs in a championship game, whether it's the playoffs in basketball, football, soccer. If the referee is deciding the game rather than the players, everyone is angry. The team that wins is accused of winning because of the referees, the team that loses is accused of losing because the referees and as such the teams get angrier and angrier and angrier. By reducing total intervention and by putting the entire onus on technology which cannot be biased in any way, we believe that individuals are less prone to these kinds of insults and these kinds of complaints and as such there will be less anger between teams and more camaraderie which will also improve everyone's enjoyment of the game. For this reason, we should introduce goal-line technology.
For government paternalism to be just it must meet a very high bar in terms of scrutiny. If we do not question every prohibition placed upon the people by the government with this sort of scrutiny, we will inevitably fall into fascist leanings and authoritarian policies. Because the speed limit represents a gross overstep of government obligation and government rights, we believe that we should cancel the speed limit in all western liberal democracies. Two independent arguments to support this motion: first, the speed limit is horribly inefficient. This can be seen at the grossest and simplest level in terms of simple time. If I can only go fifty miles per hour on a very long trip I lose out on a huge amount of time, potentially large amounts of money and it's bad for everyone. Even at the most surface level the inability to go fast decreases the increases costs in terms of transportation, in terms of food transported by truck and other products transported by truck, generally it makes the economy worse and wastes important time, which is the most valuable resource for the vast majority of individuals. But additionally it can largely lead to bumper to bumper traffic. The reason this sort of traffic occurs is because individuals do not have wide open spaces. When individuals are vying to get ahead of one another that is when the bumper to bumper traffic occurs. And when every single lane is going at approximately the same speed individuals are far more likely to exist in close proximity. And this is largely what happens in the status quo. Even the slow lane is going approximately the speed limit. However if we cancel the speed limit and the fast lane can go as fast as they want and the slow lane can go at perhaps a recommended speed limit, we get a far greater variety and are far less likely to face bumper to bumper traffic. Now, traffic with this sort of proximity is incredibly dangerous because this is where the vast majority of accents actually occur, as when individuals are incredibly close to one another. It leads to a huge loss of time. Honestly, each traffic jam which occurs can lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost as individuals cannot get to their jobs, or cannot deliver products on time, but it is also the least gas efficient option. When individuals have are in stop and go traffic, it takes a huge amount of their gas, it's bad for the environment and bad for their wallets as well. And very simply, when governments have the option to limit this sort of harm to their citizens they ought to so. As such, we should cancel the speed limit. Now the second independent argument is the idea of rights. We believe that the right to transportation is absolute. Although a current prohibitions exist on things like seat belts and and helmets, what the speed limit is unique insofar as it limits the mode of transportation. While helmets and seat belts do not get in the way of individuals actually traveling, speed limits do. Because the right to transportation is essential for government legitimacy - if individuals can't leave the state they cannot consent to the state - we believe that any infringement upon the right to transportation must be hugely, must be inherently important and hugely beneficial to the people. Additionally we would say that the vast majority of speed limits are fundamentally logically incoherent. We think that a fifty to sixty mile per hour speed limit, with modern technology, is wholly unnecessary. However it's unlikely that we will ever change that speed limit because no one wants to be the politician who put more children or more parents in danger by getting rid of the speed limit, which many individuals would perceive as the case. Without drastic policy individuals will continue to have their rights infringed, continue to lose money as a result of the speed limit, and as such we should cancel the speed limit.
We should subsidize embryonic stem cell research, because stem cell research is absolutely fantastic, and comes with little to no real ethical consequences. So, let's start by talking about why stem cell research is so important, and why it's so good. I think that we can break down the categories of problems, that stem cell research can solve, into two big groups: the problems of curing something, and the problems of costs of cures being inaccessible or too expensive. So, let's start by talking about the problems of cures altogether. There is a lot of things that we don't have the capacity to cure in the status quo. We don't have the capacity to cure a lot of nerve damage that can be occurred, a lot of things like paralysis, there is a lot of kinds of disfigurement, that can be permanent in a lot of ways, stem cell creates an opportunity to actually cure these, previously incurable, things, because by ever increasing and better research, we have a way that we can program stem cells, so that they can replace whatever damaged cells are. So, for example, if somebody maybe suffers brain damage, and you don't just make new brain cells, in the way that you make skin cells, you can now maybe possibly even help somebody with that brain damage, by programming these stem cells to become replacement brain cells. This is like incredible technology. This can change people's lives, people that have been living with problems for life long, can have cures for these kinds of problems. Additionally, it can also help with problems of excessive costs and unavailability. Because in the status quo, when you need to replace something, like let's say you need to replace a kidney, or like a liver, or something, like well probably not a liver, but like a kidney, or maybe a heart transplant, or something like that, when these things happen in the status quo, you need to wait for some kind of donor, or you need to like spend a whole lot of money on synthetic products, and things like that. So a lot of these things are oftentimes difficult to access to, because like organ donation not a lot of people are always on organ donation list, a lot of people don't end up giving things, a lot of organs are vital and you can't donate them, you have to worry about a person being a match to you as well, there's a whole lot of barriers in place that make it difficult, for a lot of people to get access to this. This is especially important given that, oftentimes we're talking about emergencies, you can't just wait for a heart transplant if you need one. So, stem cells create an opportunity to solve a lot these problems, because you can essentially take stem cells, they can be a perfect match for the they can to completely replace just about anything, and they can be created as like a match to the person itself that is needing a treatment. So, it can solve a lot of problems in that way too. So, finally let's talk about moral costs, and why I think that the moral costs, like ethical implications are pretty much nonsense. So, there's a couple of reasons for this, first and foremost, by and large, most most stem cells don't actually come from aborted fetuses, they come from things that would be maybe regularly discarded as a part of birth anyway, they can be stem cells that maybe are like clones, or they just come from other organs, like a lot of stem cells don't necessarily come from aborted fetuses in the first place, they just kind of exist, so there's really no reason why you shouldn't just study them. But, even if they do come from aborted fetuses, it's not like were making babies for the explicit purpose of aborting them so we got their stem cells. These are, by and large, people who are getting abortions anyway, that'll continue getting abortions anyway, and they're donating stem cells to science, which, for the life of me, I don't understand why is a problem, you can donate your body to science upon death, if you consented to doing so, it's like basically recycling, and it does good to society, there's no reason why it's a bad thing. And the great benefits, even if there are ethical implications, the massive massive health benefits this can help, the lives that this can save is simply more important. So, for those reasons subsidize stem cell research.
Open primaries in the united states are advantageous. Our mechanism for this debate is that of traditional open primaries. This means that every voter can now choose which party he's interested in voting for and then cast one vote only with the name of the candidate of his choosing. It essentially means that democrats can now choose to participate in republican primaries and vice versa. Two arguments in the speech: first, why this is justified and second, why this is also socially efficient. So firstly, why is this justified? The core principle in a democracy, if nothing else, is that every citizen can now take an active role in deciding who gets to decide. If I don't have the ability to influence who gets to to sit in the higher seats and offices, then this is no longer a democracy, but a tyranny. The second most important principle is that everyone gets the same amount of influence as anybody else. If there exists one group that gets a bigger influence on the outcome of an election, so this essentially means that we have broken the first principle because again, my voice my vote doesn't have true power. I don't really have an ability to influence and then it's no longer a democracy, but it's like an oligarchy. So where is the problem today? Let's imagine that there let's imagine like in an election campaign, where it is already well established that one party is going to win, let's simply assume that there's a substantial majority to one of the two parties over the other. This is not an absurd situation. This means that the general elections are becoming less important and the truly critical elections that are going to determine who gets to become president are the primaries of that majority party. Now assuming that over there, there's a more like a closer race between the candidates. So if this is a closed primaries, then eventually this is an event that's going to determine who gets to have power to influence my life, but I might be precluded from it. So this is simply undemocratic. This means that only the constituents of the majority party gets to effectively decide who becomes president. It would have been one thing had it been a role that influences only this these constituents. But it's totally different thing when this is a decision that gets to to influence everybody. Therefore, by principle, we think that the only justified solution would be to open up the primaries to whoever wishes to participate in shaping the government of the country. Second argument: why is this also efficient? So, we say that this principled argument gets a very practical foundation, specifically in the united states with the electoral college system that leads to millions of people that feel that their voice their votes don't actually matter. If I'm living in a country that's not a swing in the states or that's not a swing state, then it doesn't even matter if I'm if I'm in the minority or in the majority. The outcome is that many times like the outcome is many times just known up front, and there is nothing that I can do to change that, and this leads to a very small turnout in these states because people get disincentivized to actually go out and vote. And as a result, we are getting representatives that it would be very hard to say that truly represent the the will of the majority of the people. This means that the democracy just ceases to be an effective tool in terms of representing and executing the true will of the people. Once we open up the primaries and people can participate in setting the candidates of the other party, we say that more people will be interested in participating because they will feel that for the first time in their lives, their votes can actually matter and mean something. This means more motivation to show up and vote, which means a higher turnout, which means now democracy gets to be more efficient. For all these reasons, we're very proud to propose.
We should abolish the electoral college. The electoral college gives undue power to individuals who do not deserve it. It is fundamentally undemocratic and has incredibly problematic effects on our policy. With this in mind, we would propose the following model: that the united states federal government should immediately stop using the electoral college for presidential elections. Instead, they will simply use a direct vote system, where all votes are counted, and then the winner of the total number of votes becomes the president. Two arguments for why this is a good idea: first, on the principles of democracy. Democracy is about equal representation. It guarantees that all individuals get at least some say in policy and the policy discourse, because they can vote on matters of federal policy. Unfortunately, the electoral college provides certain individuals considerably more power than others. Why is this the case? First of the electoral college makes it so if you live in a rural area or an area with very few individuals, although you may not have as many electoral college seats, you still have more than the more power in comparison to the average person in a city. This is fundamentally unjust because it says that people in rural or less populated areas somehow deserve more democratic say and power than individuals in highly populated areas. Second reason why this is problematic is because the electoral college includes individuals who are not bound by the votes of individuals in their state or the state that they are representing. This is problematic because it says that certain individuals deserve just as much power as hundreds of thousands of americans combined who are all aggregated under other electoral college seats. We believe this is this distorts democracy and fundamentally undermines the ability for our country to maintain its legitimacy and has incredibly problematic practical effects, as I will discuss in my second argument. Many individuals claim that the purpose of democracy ought not be to give everyone a say but rather to maximize good outcomes. However, the only way in which we can understand good is through the common understanding of our world. The will of the populace must be reflected in our morality because the good is idiosyncratic. All individuals come together to determine a collective understanding of the good and pass that understanding on to the government. Someone does not deserve increased moral weight simply because they live hundreds of miles from their neighbor. In fact, the opposite would likely be a better system given that these individuals are the less least likely to understand the collective understanding of the good and the least likely to engage with other people to understand what they need to survive. My second argument is about the practical effects of removing the electoral college. First, we believe that you'll get better policy overall. If politicians are not worried about winning certain votes in certain underrepresented districts but rather more interested in winning the popular vote, they will campaign in more areas which would otherwise be seen as simply blue or red, because they can win marginal votes there, but additionally, they will pass policies which are good for the majority of americans rather than just good for the majority of land mass in america. Secondly, though, we believe that this will decrease controversy. It's less likely that you'll have partisan effects on the judiciary when the supreme court and other judicial bodies do not have to rule on political outcomes and elections. We saw this in when george w bush was elected, when the supreme court had to decide whether he would become president. This was a the beginning of a great schism in in our country based on partisan lines. But finally, we think that this will increase the mandate to rule because rather than depending on certain areas to rule, you'll just depend on the will of the people. For this reason, we should abolish the electoral college.
We should ban alcoholic beverages. So, by this we mean ban the sale in any given country of things like beer, wine and liquor. We think that we're only talking about usage for, you know, personal enjoyment, we're not talking about any potential medical usage or religious things like administering christian sacraments. So, with that in mind, we have two main arguments for why we should ban the sale of alcoholic beverages: the first is about why we think there's a need for the state to intervene to prevent people from buying alcohol. We think there are many third party harms, many innocent people who are harmed because of others' alcohol use. Healthcare costs are driven up dramatically by systematic and habitual use of alcohol throughout many countries. Alcohol is responsible for about four and a half percent of the global cost of healthcare every single year and we tell you that the cost is much higher per capita in certain countries where alcoholism is actually more prevalent. So, we don't think that everyone should be burdened with higher healthcare costs as society struggles to, like, basically accommodate some people's choice to use alcohol for fun. We also tell you that drunk drivers pose a huge threat to people in many countries around the world and that even in countries with strong rule of law and relatively safe roads, drunk driving is still a major issue. We tell you that there is no good solution to this problem other than to end the sale of alcohol and that this is justified because ultimately, people have to drive in order to get where they need to go, in order to work, to go to school, whereas alcohol is simply something that people enjoy using, it's clearly a lower order of concern. Our last point is that we think that alcohol feeds into many forms of abuse and other antisocial behavior here. So, we tell you that oftentimes, instances of neglect or child or spousal abuse are linked to people drinking. Many people become angry when they drink and are otherwise not able to control themselves and act in an appropriate way. So, we think that banning alcohol would actually reduce spousal abuse and other forms of abuse and make society safer for women and children and generally, everyone. So, the next reason for state intervention is the gap in information between people who produce alcohol and people who consume it. So, we tell you that first of all, alcoholism is grossly misrepresented in society. Alcoholism is a disease and it's probably genetic for many people and we tell you that most people don't understand this, that alcoholism runs in their family and that they can get it even if they try to behave as responsibly as possible. So, we think that at the point where there's no way to prevent people from being taken advantage of through alcoholism, we ought step in and regulate the sale of alcohol. Alcohol also causes cancer and many other health impacts and we think that most people are unaware of the fact that they're much more likely to get things like throat or mouth cancer because of drinking than they would if they didn't drink. So, we think that the state should intervene there. In addition, alcohol inhibits many types of health care treatment because of many drug interactions and we think that people are not adequately informed of that and never will be because it's not in the interest of the alcohol industry. So, we think that there's a need for state intervention because of the harms to a third party and also because of the lack of information for consumers. But next, we think that our second point is about principle consistency. We already ban other similar substances. There's no other psychoactive substance that is as easy to access and as widely accepted by society as alcohol, but we don't think that the law should favor one particular cultural choice or social choice over others. We don't think that it's the place of the law to say that it's acceptable to become intoxicated on alcohol and not on the herbs that have traditionally been used by the native peoples of north america or marijuana or other substances that have been used around the world. We think that that's effectively saying that one type of lifestyle is better than others even if the outcomes are often the same. We think that even if there's no way to perfectly enforce the law, principally, it ought be consistent for people of different lifestyles and different cultures, whereas allowing alcohol favors certain cultures over others when you ban the types of intoxicants that are favored by those cultures. So, we think therefore, that it's clear that principally you ought ban alcohol and also that there is a need for the state to intervene to do so. Thank you.
We should abolish congressional earmarks. So, by abolish, we think that congress should be forbidden from including earmarks in legislation and by congressional earmarks, we mean language in laws requiring spending in a specific area beyond the required level of specificity for the law to take effect. So, this might be an example of if the federal government were to build new highways, congress requiring that the highway go between town a and town b in a particular state, rather than just saying look, have the executive branch figure out where the highways ought to go. So, two big arguments here: one is that this undermines the executive branch and the second is that this is fundamentally corrupt. So, regarding the executive branch, the US constitution sets out very clear separation of powers. Among these separations is that the legislative branch, namely, congress, gets to determine what the government is going to spend their money on by passing laws that allocate funding. However, it's up to the executive branch to determine how to use this funding after it's been approved. So, the executive branch has tens and tens of thousands of professional employees whose job is to determine how best to spend the federal government's money. So, it might help to think of this as congress is the big picture. They say we want highways and the federal government has the people with the expertise to determine how these highways should be built and where and by whom. But when the legislative branch, when congress decides that they're going to include earmarks, they prevent the executive branch from doing this. It doesn't matter if experts on highway construction in the executive branch say that this road needs to be built between town c and b if congress has already included requirements in the law that it go between a and b because that's convenient for some senator who's up for reelection this year. It is inconvenient for the executive branch to have to balance all of these concerns which are often contradictory as different congress people require different earmarks and different bills and this leads to it being very difficult for them to do their jobs, to the point where they're spending more time dealing with earmarks than they are dealing with how to best actually carry out business. This ultimately also leads to much less effective spending. If congress approves the amount of money that it should take to build a road but they include requirements that make the road much more expensive to build because it has to go to lots of towns that shouldn't have been included on the highway in the first place, then ultimately, the taxpayers are going to have to borrow money rather than spend the money that they were actually allocated because congress is making it more expensive to get something done. We also think that the cycle of greed creates mistrust and resentment between the executive branch and the legislative branch which makes it more difficult for the two groups to get their business done, as the legislators know that the executives want to take away their precious earmarks and the executive branch knows that their job would be much easier if they were just allowed to get things done. So, our second argument is that this is fundamentally corrupt, which is probably pretty apparent because basically what this does is lets congress people buy reelection through what we call pork barrel spending. Basically, congress people can say look, I will get a bridge built in our town that'll employee lots of people and buy supplies from local businesses, but only if you reelect me. Otherwise, I won't get it. So, in that way, the voters know that they can basically sell their vote to the congress person to get federal money. So, what this means is leads to huge waste and redundancy. A good example is that in the US, even though we have tons of battle tanks and the army doesn't ever expect to fight another war where we use these tanks, we keep building them because there are requirements set by congress in the form of earmarks that require tank factories in certain towns because the employment that these factories create is part of how certain senators get reelected. The same thing with the US government, literally building bridges that don't go anywhere because of earmarks. And certain representatives even hold congress hostage and refused to pass things like emergency relief bills after hurricanes unless earmarks are put in that help their district up in nebraska who wasn't affected by the hurricane at all. So, what we can see is that this is tremendously corrupt and undermines the executive branch, so we should abolish congressional earmarks. Thank you.
We should have year round schooling because it'll be better for the students who will be able to better enjoy their vacations and it'll also be better for actual learning. So for starters, year round school obviously doesn't just mean that you go to school everyday of the year and you get rid of the summer. We probably should have a similar number of days off, a similar number of vacations for people but now those can be better spread out. So instead of getting just those three weeks, a spring break, and a winter break, and a couple of random holidays, now you can actually get more substantive vacation. So maybe instead of getting just thursday and friday off for thanksgiving you get the whole week off. Maybe instead of just getting instead of getting two weeks off for winter break you get a month off. Maybe you get a month in the summer instead of three months and it would basically be a redistribution of the days off. And I think that that would probably be a whole lot better for a couple of reasons. First, because I think kids will like it more. Most kids aren't going to be like losing the sacrifice of going to summer camp or something like that because most kids can't afford that and most kids, when they're going on some kind of trip or vacation, it's usually something that's a lot shorter, it's usually something that you can do within the confines of a month. You don't really need a whole summer to do that. And most of the time, the people that get affected the most are people who are just kind of sitting around all summer because they don't really have opportunities to do a whole lot of other things with their time over their summer. Their parents work, so they're kind of just sitting around and they would probably be a whole lot better served. And I think people, the students themselves would probably like this is if they were given more breaks where they can recharge their batteries. Because being a student is pretty stressful. You have a lot of things, you're taking a lot of classes, you have to do work when you get home usually you have extracurricular activities, you may have a job too, it's certainly no walk in the park being a kid especially if you're like being pushed academically or you're doing a sport or something like that. You have a lot of things that you're usually doing so getting vacation days is nice and it's nice to have more than just a couple of days a year or two big breaks a year and then summer break. It would probably be nice if those things were more spread out because people get burned out and in order to recover from the burn out you don't really need a whole summer, you only need maybe a couple of days or a week and that's something that I think from a health standpoint would be a lot better for kids. But also there's the obvious benefits of memory and learning because one of the biggest complaints that a lot of teachers have and it makes a whole lot of sense is that people forget things and you have to spend a and you have to spend like the first month or two of school just reviewing old material because when you completely because because when you spend three or more months just not studying or not really doing anything for school, you're probably going to forget those things and that's going to be pretty helpful in harmful or detrimental to your learning. But the final thing is that the idea of having a summer vacation and the winter break and things like the current system of vacation is pretty archaic. It was like designed around the harvest basically like there's no real reason why we have vacations when we do. It's just kind of something that's always existed so there's no real reason why we shouldn't try to get some reform through. So for all those reasons we should have year round school.
Prenatal diagnosis brings more good than harm. What prenatal diagnosis allows individuals to do with their caregivers, with their doctors is to see what what is happening with the fetus. So this means being able to screen not just the gender of the child but also to screen for genetic defects, for different illnesses that may arise during pregnancy, to get a better understanding of the health of the child. In this regard, we think that prenatal diagnosis does demonstrably more good than harm. So firstly, we're gonna talk about preparedness for parents and why that's so crucial, and secondly, whe're gonna talk about why information is always a net good. So firstly, on preparation. We think that there are two instances in which this can help avoid a tremendous amount of pain and difficulty both for parents and possibly for children. Firstly, in instances when children have rare genetic disorders that them to be stillborn or cause them to be terminally ill immediately after birth, we think that this gives the option for women to know that information in advance and to make a decision about whether or not she wants to choose to carry that child to birth or to term. Now we think that that choice is entirely legitimate to make, but we think that oftentimes women we think that oftentimes when children are born and are born terminal, are born stillborn, are are not able to live past their birth, we think that this is incredibly scarring for women to put your body through nine months of intense labor, pain and hardship, only to have this child that you have already grown attached to die in your own arms. We think this is a tremendous psychological and emotional harm that happens to women and to and to fathers. And we think that parents should be able to avoid this hardship. In instances in which children are going to be stillborn, are not going to be able to live because of their genetic illnesses what have you, we don't think that parents should be forced to carry those children to term and only deal with the consequences. Now in the vast majority of instances this isn't the case though. In the vast majority of instances in which genetic illnesses or defects are detected, children are not going to die after birth, and we think those are the instances that are most important. Cause we think that, information can only allow parents to make better decisions for their children. Recognize that a child that is that's born with a genetic disorder, is going to face special challenges in their life. They're going to need special assistance to make sure that they can be as successful as possible. They need to get different educational care they need different early childhood care and different attention, different and parents simply don't know all this information. The average person doesn't know what is required to take care of a child with down syndrome or a child with autism. And given that this is the case, we think that when you allow parents to have this information ahead of time, they're going to be able to do research on this on this they're going to be able to make preparations whether they need to do certain things to their house to make it safe, whether or not they need to find certain doctors ahead of time to make sure that their child will be born and will be healthy and safe moving forward, all these things are considerations that the average parent won't need to won't need to deal with, but which is crucial for a parent that is having a child that has some sort of illness that needs to be dealt with. We think that it's good both for the parents and for the child to know this information ahead of time, because planning allows for a smooth start to life for that child immediately, it doesn't mean that there needs to be some sort of in between time in which the child is not receiving the care that it needs, and secondly, it allows parents to mentally prepare for the difference between raising for the differences that they will face and the challenges, the unique challenges they will face in raising a child that has special needs. We think that this isn't a challenge that can't be overcome, we think hundreds and thousands of brave parents and really good parents do this all the time, but without that mental preparation it become so much more difficult to deal with what you need to do moving forward, and giving that mental preparation and information is crucial in both instances in which it may be needed. And because of that, we think prenatal diagnosis brings more good than harm.
We should increase immigration to the united states. So by this we mean that the US should increase the quota for immigrants. Right now there is an overall quota of about six hundred thousand people per year who are allowed to immigrate to the US. We think that that quota should be vastly increased to as many as two and a half million people, much much higher than it is today. Secondly, through out our individual country quotas, which means that it's much easier to come to this country from bhutan than it is from china, because the quota is the same for every country. We think those quotas should be abolished completely. If we have two million people who want to come here from india we say let them. So three reasons why the US should do this. First, we tell you that immigration leads to economic growth. It's simple math that when you bring people to this country and have them get to work, that your overall domestic product increases because you have more people producing. But on top of that we tell you that the kind of people who are likely to give up their life in their home country and come to america are the sort of go getters who lead to economic growth. There's a reason that so many businesses in america are founded by immigrants or by their children. We tell you that ultimately these are people with drive and initiative who are very likely to take risks to start businesses, to work harder, to put in extra hours. That ultimately these are the kind of people that we want in our country: hardworking people who will ultimately grow the economy by having a greater output of their work than what we would have otherwise. We think it's silly to cap the amount of people who are allowed to come here when it means that we cap our own economic growth. Our second argument is about the humanitarian reasons, why the US should do this. Right now there are hundreds of thousands of syrians who need a place to live and the united states is a mostly empty country. We tell you that it is inexcusable for america, which has bountiful land and enough money to settle these people, not to let them come here to live in safety. We think that it's inexcusable to let people die around the world in wars partially caused by american intervention and then not let them move to this country. In particular, for places like vietnam and iraq that have been devastated by US intervention, we think that we owe it to those people to let them start a new life here because we damaged their ability to carry out their old life there. But aside from this, at the point where people have a right to live in freedom and safety, and at the point in which the US is mostly empty, particularly much of the west, we think that we should be bringing these people in, helping them get established, and that ultimately this would be beneficial for everyone. Our third and final argument, and I think that this is critical for the debate, is that immigration is part of what makes america, america. Almost everyone here has ancestors who immigrated voluntarily. We think that in the past the US has been an international center of economic growth and innovation because of the strong tradition of immigration. I told you about why immigrants are likely to work harder than other people because they're go getters by their very nature, but on top of that every new wave of immigration to the united states re-entrenches that culture of innovation. If you think about who goes to elite universities in america today, many people would say there's lots of asian people, but that's driven by the fact that the most recent waves of immigration have largely been asian. A hundred years ago, many people were resentful that there were so many jews in american universities, but that was partly driven by the fact that there was a large wave of jewish immigration. We tell you that ultimately new waves of immigration will ensure that we have more people pushing their children to succeed in the way that immigrant families tend to do. That their children will go to harvard, yale, stanford, wherever, and ultimately continue to ensure that the US is a center of innovation. But aside from that immigrants also bring a unique perspective to the united states, a global perspective. The idea that we should care about what happens around the world, that we shouldn't just isolate ourselves and let dictators or other horrible things go on unchallenged. So ultimately we think that immigrants bring a huge amount to the united states that makes us who we are as a country. For these reasons we think that we should increase immigration to the united states. Thank you.
We should prohibit slum tourism. Slum tourism is basically when wealthy people visit a very low-income or downtrodden area in order to see what it's like there, to see the people who live there and things like that. So this might look like american tourists visiting brazil and going into the favelas, for instance. So with this in mind, we think that the countries where the slum tourism takes place should ban this practice. So in our example, it would be brazil banning it, not the united states. A few reasons why we think that this should be true: first, slum tourism is degrading to the people who live in these slums. Realize that the people who live there don't do so by choice. Most of these people came to the city for work or were misled about the economic opportunities they would have there, or their family has been there for a long time so they're forced to live in these conditions. We think that it's unfair to put these people on display like zoo animals given that this is their home, given that they don't want to be in these conditions. Ultimately, we think that it is denying these people their human dignity to allow slum tourism. When you have people coming in to gawk, people coming in and taking photos on cameras that cost more than the people who live there make in a year, we think that this is ultimately demeaning to them. Rather than offering help to these people, we're instead spending money on making them an object of entertainment for the international elite. We think that, in particular, this actually undermines any sort of empathy for these people. Recognize that the rich and powerful who are visiting don't go home and do anything to help them or at least they haven't in the past. Instead, they go home and put their pictures on instagram and maybe take a picture of themselves giving a dollar to some needy child. It lets these people feel good without actually increasing the amount of empathy that they feel for those living in these conditions. If anything, it undermines sympathy, because it makes them feel like they can leave and the problem goes away. We've often heard that the poor are a problem which is out of sight and out of mind. But even if you go and visit for a short period of time, being able to leave undermines your ability to think about this as a permanent solution because to you, it's a temporary thing completely. At this point, we think it's clear that government should ban slum tourism to protect the dignity of the people who live there and because it undermines the ability of people to have empathy for those who are worse off. But secondly, we think that slum tourism should be prohibited because it harms the traditional tourist industry. Think about what you do when you go to a slum tour. You go you go, probably on a bus or with a guide, into a unsafe neighborhood. You don't spend money at restaurants there, you're not staying in that area. Ultimately, we think it's very likely that you don't participate in the traditional tourist economy, where people visit and spend lots of money on food and housing and things like that. We think that if you prohibited slum tourism, that if people still wanted to visit these areas, they would have to partake in more traditional tourism. So they would be staying in hotels in the area, they would be eating food in the area. Now perhaps fewer people would do this, but at the point where more money on net is coming into the local economy, we still think that this is a good thing. Aside from that, even if people choose to go to other areas instead, we think that they'll probably spend more money overall, because rather than paying tour or tour companies from their home country to set this up for them, they're going to be spending money at the beaches in brazil and things like that. Lastly, we think that slum tourism is unsafe and and ultimately, has burdens for the state in that respect. If you recall, there was tremendous concern about the brazil olympics because people were worried that the athletes would be mugged. As a result, there was a huge amount of spending on police and gendarmes and other paramilitary groups to protect the olympic athletes. We see something similar in place to protect tourists in these impoverished areas. We think that this is a poor use of funds that could go to actually helping people and policing their communities rather than spending public funds to protect rich tourists. So for these reasons, we should prohibit slum tourism. Thank you.
We should ban school uniforms, because they ultimately have a good amount of good for the students, they create good in the fact that it gives students an outlet to express their creativity, their individuality and their preferences, and it creates good in that it allows students to just wear clothing that is more comfortable for them, more fitting for them, like better for them, which I also which I think makes them like better students even in a lot of ways actually. So let's start by talking about the first thing, the creativity. Because I think that it's important that when we look at students, especially given that schools aren't purely academic atmosphere, that they have social elements to them as well. Students want to be able to express themselves, they want to express their individuality, they want to express what they like, what they don't like, things like that. These are, for what it's worth and worth noting, constitutional protections that a lot of students have in places like america to express their speech in that way. And I think that there's like a true value to that, when everyone just wearing the same, when everyone just looks the same and is wearing the same things, you don't really feel like you're able to express yourselves, you feel like one of just like a mob, and that's just not something that people like, and that's a harm already. The next thing I'm going to talk about, though, is about comfort. So, I think that just oftentimes school uniforms aren't particularly comfortable, they're not the kind of clothes that maybe people are comfortable in different kinds of clothing, and I think that that's actually important to note, because a lot of people just work better or more able to focus when they're wearing things that are comfortable, like I'm much better able to work when I'm wearing pajamas than I'm wearing a suit, which I think is uncomfortable, I'm better able to focus. There's plenty of people who feel like that, a lot of students, especially when you're younger, are very likely to have focus in this way. Being comfortable is also better, you don't want to be wearing like like a thick thing if it's like bothering, shorter shorts if it's sweating if it's like hot out or you're sweating and things like that, like these are basic things and but they are nevertheless important things. So, the next thing is I want to just like weigh all of that against the fact, compare it all to the fact that there is no real positive impact for uniforms. Like first and foremost, recognize that this is about uniforms, not dress code, so obviously a lot of the more extreme harms that people could talk about on the other side are not actually all that important, it's just like hyperbole. But the final thing that I want to talk about, is about like a lot of the lies that are associated with other things, like wearing certain types of clothes is not a distraction, there's no real evidence of that, wearing certain kind of clothing doesn't make you like focus any better, or you get things like that. These are ultimately just unfounded assertions, and it shouldn't be valued very heavily. So, for all of those reasons, very proud to propose.
The motion for today's debate is that we should subsidize investigative journalism. Just some brief modeling: what we mean by subsidize investigative journalism is that we would have individual governments put more money into either grants that would encourage existing news corporations to add more to their investigative journalism departments and subsidize specifically that portion we would provide scholarships for individuals who want to enter into investigative journalism just general acceptance and encouragement of investigative journalism as a prospering field that we would want more representative, more existing. Three main areas of clash. First about promoting the free press, because I think we need to recognize that in order to have any system of democracy we first have to have a functioning free press that can work within that system. I think what's really important to recognize here as why this is true is that it is incredibly difficult to have a democracy if the people are not informed. This is because it becomes very easy for dictators or people who want power in the region to misinform the populace using their own news sources and they don't have anyone to check against them. So what investigative journalist does is it allows ordinary individuals who might not have power in other regards to be able to take that power from other individuals to make sure that they are being countable and democratic and inform the general populace that that general populace can then make decisions that can be in alignment with democracy as a general standard. And so we think it's actually promoting the free press and like creating a world in which we check our politicians through investigation is fundamental to creating a democratic state in which individuals aren't oppressed in the first place. Our second area of clash is about undercutting the tide that we have seen of rising conservative values and general fascism. Like we think we see this in many countries with the rising support for with the election of donald trump within the united states the rising support for anti-immigration and liberal policies and in like countries like germany and france and turkey we see pena nieto maintaining power in countries like mexico and we say that this is vastly because they are able to do things that control the main television lines the main newspapers and the main radio stations of those countries such as pena nieto's ability to control the only two existing television corporations within mexico and without that they wouldn't be able to do that. So we think that given that this is something that we see the world as a whole from suffering from right now we think becomes incredibly important specifically at this moment to combat it even if you don't think that generally this is something that promotes democratic values. Because we think what we do on our side of the house is we provide individuals with the ability to break out of these kinds of habits, break out of this kind of like general trend and to be able to check your politicians to recognize whether you actually want the kind of policies that they turn out to be in acting. And we think that like one of the best ways to do that is to subsidize a field such as investigative journalism where people are encouraged to go out and actually do things that can unveil large networks that are of like corrupt government officials and like inform the public to be angry about these kinds of things. We also think this is really important in terms of keeping corporations accountable eventhough we've been talking about governments a lot. Like I think one of the ways in which corporations are able to keep power in capitalist societies that might have very strong democratic regimes such as the united states is by doing a lot of things under wraps such is not reporting how many human rights abuses they have or having investors who are who like benefited off of the housing crisis and things like that so I think that the only way in which you ever to again that is through investigative journalism. But finally I think it's important to recognize that encouraging people to enter these kinds of fields is also really important. We live in a world that is becoming more and more STEM focused and although STEM fields are very important we think that we have to also encourage and show people that there are still demand for those who want to enter humanity related fields. Proud to propose.
A legal age of consent was never meant as a punishment, it was meant to protect underage children from being taken advantage of. Note, that the legitimacy in such a law, an overly protectionist law, requires that that protection be overwhelmingly necessary. A particularly high bar is set, when there is a blanket policy, telling all people of a certain age, that they must refrain from an activity, in order to protect some of those people, who may not be able to make that decision over themselves. Our mechanism in this debate is somewhat nonspecific, in that we don't think we have the exact details in order to make a specific age. Roughly we think, it should be lowered from eighteen to somewhere between fourteen and sixteen, presumably varying to some extent between cultures. Our assumption is as follows: eighteen was the correct age for consent. The correct age is based on a, a person's body being ready for sex, meaning having gone through puberty, and b, ability to understandingly consent, meaning, there's some form of cognitive grasp, of what it is that an individual is consenting to, and what they're entering into, the ability to give that proper consent we think, that in both those realms, changes have overcome society in such a way, that the ability to give that consent is now reached at a younger age. Let's talk about those two things. So firstly, regarding bodily preparedness. People in general, and girls specifically, are maturing at a younger age nowadays. The reasons for this are an overuse of products and food, which contain hormones, and those hormones in turn make puberty come earlier. So, over the past few decades, girls have been getting their periods earlier and earlier, growing breasts earlier and earlier, men's testicles have been dropping earlier and earlier. So on that end we think, as far as physically becoming adults, people are doing so at a much younger age nowadays. Secondly, let's talk about societal changes, we think there are two such changes: one, as society is becoming more sex positive, and open toward sex in general. This means, that they're discussing sex more, this means that they're displaying sex more, this means that it's no longer shunned or taboo. What this means, is that the issues of sex are more accessible to younger audiences in general. The second thing, is that specifically they're being made accessible, actively, for younger and younger people. Younger and younger, TV shows are using sex to captivate younger audiences, younger people are being used as sexual icons, I would note justin bieber being portrayed as a sexual icon, beginning at the age of thirteen for example. All of this means, that parents, and an education system, are all equipped and dealing with the issues of sexuality earlier, which enables the necessary cognitive tools and social framework, for a younger individual to opt in to sex. So, because we no longer have reasonable cause to prevent them from acting based on their urges, we beg you to propose.
We should further exploit hydroelectric dams. When it comes to debates about energy, and energy innovation, we think that there's one thing that always needs to be kept in mind, that is crucial for these debates, which is the fact that climate change, as we understand it, is moving rapidly towards a point of no return, that, if not abated by removing our fossil fuel intake, and switching to renewable energy, such as hydroelectric power, we're going to approach a point at which the CO two levels in the atmosphere are going to rise, to where we cannot to where it will be above two degrees celsius of heating, over the global temperature, and in which massive changes in the environment, massive changes in the atmosphere, are going to result that are likely going to decimate major cities, coastal areas, and even entire countries. We think that we need to avoid this, and if we don't do things like switch to hydroelectric power immediately, and with intense vigor, we're going to leave a world that is less and less habitable for our children. So, that's what we're going to talk about. When we talk about further exploiting hydroelectric dams, what we mean is increasing government state investment into this technology, increasing the usage, to developing more hydroelectric dams, probably putting some money into r and d, into try to make them more efficient, but as I'll talk about in a second, these things are already largely effective. Okay, so why is this a good source of clean energy? Firstly, it is clearly reusable, in the sense that sense hydroelectric dams operate on running water, it doesn't require any sort of input outside of developing the hydroelectric dam, in ensuring that the river, or whatever is running through these hydroelectric dams, is maintained. And this isn't incredibly difficult. While it's true that there are costs to the environment, associated with hydroelectric dams, and development that needs to take place in areas, that are usually not developed, we think that the comparative trade off between this, and the clear and massive damage that is done to the environment from fossil fuels, is one that is worth taking the risk. It also is able to be used in a wide array, wide variety of environments, essentially anywhere, where there's sufficient running water, is a place where you could put a hydroelectric dam, which means unlike things like wind power, or solar power, it's not based on the environment in the area, not based on weather, it's not based on cloud coverage, or the amount of wind, but rather it's just based on having the natural flowing water. And thirdly, what's interesting about hydroelectric dams is that they currently compose the vast majority of reusable energy that currently exists, and why this is beneficial is that in comparison to other technologies, such as solar, and wind, in which large amounts of investment money go into research and development, most of the money that would be going into hydroelectric dams, would be going purely into the creation of energy, because for the most part, we've been able to improve hydroelectric dams over a number of years. Hydroelectric dams have been in use for for for decades, and given that this is the case, we think that, given that we need to rapidly transition to clean energy, we need to rapidly make these changes occur, we should invest in technologies like hydroelectric dams, in which most of most of the research and development has already been done, and now it's just a process process of installing the infrastructure, which means with hydro electric power you're more likely to get more bang for your buck, than you are with other types of renewable energy. As we've explained, it is clearly the case that continuing our current trajectory is simply not tenable. It's not going to leave a world that is habitable for our children, or even habitable for us, twenty years down the line. We think that hydroelectric dams are technologies, that are already well understood, where the research and development has already been put in, and where public investment could lead to increases in energy usage, increases in clean energy usage, and that these things are clearly preferable to the status quo we're living in now. For these reasons, we should further exploit hydroelectric dams.
Goal-line technology brings more good than harm. So, by this we mean things like instant replay, and technology actually at the gold level in fifa matches, and we think that, by do more good than harm, that ultimately this would be good for fifa, and it's good for sport in general. So we have to arguments for you, the first is about faith and referees. So, most sports rely very heavily on perceived legitimacy of the officials, like the referees, in order for people to have faith that the outcome of the games aren't rigged or aren't heavily biased. So if people don't think that the referees are doing their job properly, then they're going to be less invested in the sport. We think that we solve for this because when you can go back and have a referee reverse the poor call by using instant replay technology, then people know that the referee is actually doing a better job, is more willing to overturn bad calls, and is actually able to make a good call when they're too far away to see something up close. All of this means that you get more viewers because people will think that the sport is more fair. One reason why people might stop watching sport or choose not to watch it, is that they think that the matches are rigged, and it's much more difficult to think that matches are rigged if it's demonstrably true that they simply aren't because we have computers that can replay exactly what's happening. But on top of that, we think referees will be more willing to change calls. Right now while it's true that referees in fifa and other sports can change a call after it's made, they have little reason to do so because they're not getting more information after they make their original call. Now we can provide them with more and better information which might reverse bad calls, and reward teams for playing well rather than for having good luck. So we think that ultimately teams will play better when the incentive is more to focus on winning the game and not gamesmanship and showmanship, as unfortunately is sometimes the case right now. Think about flopping in basketball as an example of this. Players pretend to get injured who aren't really getting injured, but with instant replays we can tell if it's legitimate or not and avoid the rest being tricked by gamesmanship. So our second argument, is about why we think it's harder to rig matches if you have instant replay technology. So we think that first of all you need accountability to prevent matches from being rigged. Recognize first of all that when a match is rigged, lots of people have to be involved in this. Many players, coaches, referees are all involved. It's very rare that it's only one person who is rigging a match, and in those instances we still think we better check by having instant replay technology. Because we think that we can prove that someone didn't play their hardest, or that a goalie allowed the ball to go in, or that a referee was calling shots unfairly for a particular team, or that a coach wouldn't make a certain play that needed to be made for his team to win the game. We think that accountability and rigging matches are really important because so many people invest a lot of money in owning and managing teams, lots of communities, economies are based around the supplying service economy that goes along with the team, so we think that this actually is very important to a lot of communities that sports are fair and that people are going out to watch matches. We think that you change the decision making process for everyone involved who might be engaged in cheating by having instant replay. If everyone knows that there's a greater risk that they'll get caught doing the wrong thing, then we think that they won't do the wrong thing as often. This seems pretty intuitive, that if you know you could lose your cushy job as a ref or as a sports player, that you're ultimately not going to cheat because you would rather keep your job rather than gamble or otherwise break the rules. But we also think that players will have more faith in one another if everyone is kept honest by this instant replay technology. I think that it's pretty likely that a lot of players who cheat right now, or officials that cheat right now, do it because they think everyone's doing it and there's a cultural problem where it's impossible to prove that other people aren't taking advantage, and you are worse off than everyone else if you aren't also take advantage. But with instant replay we can show who was actually being genuine and who isn't, so we think that people will have more faith in other people involved in the sport, and thus that there will be less of an incentive to cheat for that reason. Lastly we think that punishments will be more fair if it's more apparent what people are actually doing. Using instant replay is a bit like having DNA evidence in a court trial, instead of just relying on witness testimony. We think that you can actually be more fair in allocating punishment to players, officials, and anyone else who's involved in cheating. So for these reasons, we think that goal-line technology brings more good than harm. Thank you.
We should abolish the two party system. In the status quo americans have incredibly limited choices. When they go to the polling office, they are not voting based on the candidate they're voting based on the letter next to the name. This is incredibly problematic and as such we would support the following model: that the united states begin to subsidize the largest parties, the largest five parties to a much greater degree and decrease the bar for a party to get federal funding by a massive amount. We would like to see at least five parties competing for spots in congress, and in local spots as well. Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first on citizen choice. In the status quo we see individuals voting on problematic ideas. Instead of voting by researching the candidate and determining what is best, they vote based on their own personal identities to democrat or republican. This is incredibly problematic as local areas might not have the best politician, but they might win simply because they're a democrat or republican will always vote on the party line. This means that democracy is not being fulfilled. This means that our understanding of the good is not being applied to our political system, as people can win with incredibly little opposition simply due to the party they belong to. The second way in which citizens choices limited in the status quo is because in this, in a variety of cases individuals only have two options. If my choice is between a big corporate democrat or a big corporate republican, although they might differ on social issues, I'm ultimately going to get a very similar policy outcome either way. By having a variety of parties we allow individuals to take a variety of positions. If I don't want to vote for a big party candidate, a party can arise which generally does not support big business, or does not support problematic an oppressive systems of power in our country. This will increase citizen choice and allow them to better articulate themselves in the marketplace of ideas. My second argument is about politician choice. Because in the status quo politicians do not have options for when and where to vote effectively. Both parties have incredibly stupid ideas which they propose. Unfortunately individuals are required to vote on the party line or lose all power which they at one time had. By having a variety of parties if someone wants to vote against their party or vote against the party line they both are less likely to be punished, as that person can move to a different party and as such limit your own party's power, but secondly if they are being punished, can simply follow through with their threat. Move to a different party, start a different party, and generally be reelected on a different platform because they were at the time honest in their campaign. By increasing politician choice we inherently increase citizen choice as well and have a better system of policies. Because individuals are far far more likely to adopt the policies which are best for their area rather than just best for their party, we will generally see individuals wills represented to a far greater degree than in the status quo. My third argument is about cooperation. In the status quo there's no incentive for the two parties to cooperate. That's because there's a zero sum game in our political system. Every republican who gets a seat is a democrat who lost a seat. With a system of multiple parties coalition building is first a requirement to pass any policies, and because passing policies that the best way to get reelected, will always occur. But secondly, cooperation is no longer zero sum. If I cooperate with someone who agrees with my ideology in more regards than another party, their far more likely to win out against people from other parties they disagree with. This is important as it allows politicians to cooperate with one another, have cohesive nuanced policy positions which represent the will of the vast majority of americans, rather than simply a single group who had been put in power for a considerable amount of time simply because of their historical position. For this reason that we should abolish the two party system.
I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should protect the right to universal access to the internet. First an overview. So the main contention of this speech will be that internet access is a facilitative right. That is, that it in and of itself is key to accessing other fundamental rights that we hold dear. So the reason why facilitative rights are important is because they are as important as the rights they secure. If I cannot access my, say, right to life without say, healthcare, then healthcare is also a right because it is key to ensuring that the first thing can actually be achieved. Given that we think the internet becomes a right by virtue of the fact that it is important to accessing other things that are more intuitive rights. With that three independent points. First, that internet access is facilitative to our right to free speech. Free speech as a right matters for two reasons. First, it matters because it's key to autonomy. Humans are social beings so we have a desire to express things. Restrictions then on what we can express and the ideas that we can put forward in conversation and in public platforms are necessarily restrictions on our autonomy. I think autonomy can generally be agreed upon as the most fundamental right that in so far as we have a life and insofar as we have sentience, we want the capacity to express ourselves and act in the ways that we deem fit and deem as the best way of increasing our personal happiness. So secondly we would say that free speech is important because it yields desire fulfillment. I think a good example of this is that when you speak openly about something that you want, you put pressure on, say, governments to fulfill that desire, fulfill that want. Generally speaking free speech allows you to put pressure on whatever actor you decide to go with for the sake of argument and put pressure on them to fulfill that desire or need of yours. So the reason why the internet is facilitative to free speech rights is because it resolves asymmetries between powerful and non powerful individuals in terms of how much their speech actually achieves these things that we use free speech to attain. Powerful people, in the past and even in the status quo, have greater free speech because their platforms that they operate under they have a closer ear to public officials, their like financial capacity makes them more you know important in the eyes of many other people. We think that the internet though has the capacity to amplify people's voices and make them heard in a way that was not historically possible. So it resolves that asymmetry. The second right that we'd like to advance to you is information. So we think that there's a right to information again for two reasons. First, we think it matters because information decreases suffering. So health knowledge, for example, is key to your ability to actually access your right to good health. But secondly, it increases viewpoint diversity. I think this is important because realistically when we are looking at any individual person, there is a certain understanding that that person to come can come to that is probably ideal for that individual. That their reasoning and the experiences they have been brought up on, bring them to a logical conclusion. And we think when they have more access to information, facts, they can reach that objective end point. Like even if you don't think that there is a objective end point in what the truth is on a broader spectrum, I think it is intuitively true that there is an objective end point for the individual based on the inputs they received throughout their lives. So the internet is facilitative to this right because it decreases the capacity of elite actors to restrict access to information. We think that despots in the status quo restrict people's capacity to understand what's going on around them in the world, and the internet mitigates that by bringing the information directly to the people. Proud to propose.
We should abolish capital punishment. So we're going to argue that countries should abolish the death penalty in every instance if they haven't already done so. Many countries have already abolished the death penalty as have many US states but we think that its use is unacceptable in every jurisdiction and that it should be banned in every place. We have two main arguments for our side this evening. The first is about the risk of killing innocents. In recent years we have seen many convictions overturned by the new application of different types of forensic evidence. For instance in the late nineties and early two thousands many convictions were overturned by the new application of DNA evidence and DNA evidence continues to improve every year and new forensic techniques are being developed all the time. The take away from this is that we realize that the criminal justice system is imperfect and that new technology will probably acquit many people in the future who were convicted in good faith right now. The problem with the death penalty is that if someone is wrongfully convicted and sentenced to it after they've been executed there's nothing that we can do for that person. There's no way to undo this injustice the way that there is if someone is only imprisoned. So we think that ultimately the risk of someone being wrongfully convicted and it's a certainty that that applies to some people the risk of someone being wrongfully convicted and then executed is too great for us to continue to use the death penalty. Ultimately it's certain that some innocent people will be killed and at that point the state is acting on a moral level no better than the people who are committing murders in the first place. We think that this is unacceptable that it undermines the state's legitimacy and that it's an abuse of power which leads nicely into our next argument about how this is an abuse of the state's power. There is a huge imbalance in power between citizens and the state. The state has a monopoly on violence which gives them much more power than any citizen in terms of controlling our well being and physical status. We think that whenever there is a huge imbalance of power between two parties the party which is more powerful has an obligation to use their power responsibly and with reserve because the other party can't react so in other words when the state interacts with individuals it needs to use its power sparingly because there's such a difference in power between the state apparatus and an individual. Ultimately we think that using the death penalty is an abuse of the state power because there's no way for people to appeal there's no way for this to be undone if it's used in error ultimately we don't think it's an acceptable use of this huge imbalance of power between state and individual. But what's more I think society recognizes that this is an abuse of government power. Consider that a few hundred years ago almost every crime could be punished with the death penalty. In britain in the eighteenth century if you stole something worth ten cents you could be hung for it. So we see that over time there's been a reduction in the scope of the death penalty. What this indicates I think is that people recognize that the death penalty is an unfair punishment. They're just slow to change the way that it's applied. For instance in the united states it used to be even thirty years ago that the death penalty was used in instances of rape but now it's limited to first degree murder. We've seen the scope of things considered heinous enough to deserve the death penalty grow smaller and smaller I think as people recognize just how heinous the death penalty is. We would complete and take this to its logical conclusion by abolishing the death penalty in every instance rather than using it arbitrarily for some crimes and not others. For all these reasons we should abolish capital punishment. . Thank you
We should lower the age of consent. So by this we mean that in jurisdictions where it's not already the case we think that the age of consent should be sixteen years old for men and women and that there should be romeo and juliet laws. So these are laws which basically say that if two people are under the age of consent, then it's legal for them to have sex with one another even if it wouldn't be legal for them to have sex with an adult. And basically these laws are designed to prevent, you know, teenagers who are in a relationship from accidentally ending up on the sex offender registry for something that was completely consensual and probably shouldn't be illegal. So with that in mind we're going to present two arguments for why we think these would be good policies. The first is basically that kids will be kids. We think that ultimately no one is being harmed if two people who are not adults yet choose to engage in consensual sexual activity. We think that in many jurisdictions right now the punishments are extremely harsh. In many american states people can end up on a sex offenders list, where for the rest of their life it's going to be difficult for them to get employed. They won't be able to join the military, they won't be able to access some sorts of education, they're gonna have to tell their neighbors that they're a sex offender until the day that they die. And this is obviously a system that was designed to go after perverts and people who are doing really awful things not sixteen year olds who hooked up after prom one night. So we think that the law isn't actually serving the purpose it was intended to create. We think that it's really important that we don't let the letter of the law get in the way of protecting and helping people. So obviously we want to protect minors from being taken advantage of by adults, but we also want to recognize that people who are sixteen are probably able to consent to being in a relationship and having sexual intercourse with one another and doing that in a responsible way, particularly if we offer things like sex education in schools. So we think that at that point the best way that the law can help these people is to make it so that there is these romeo and juliet laws so that people can engage in sex with their peers while still protecting them if they're taken advantage of by someone older. And also by recognizing that sixteen year olds are probably able to make meaningful consent. Which leads nicely into my second point, which is about legal consistency. So in many american states people are able to get married at age sixteen. You can join the military with your parents consent at age sixteen. You can drive a car at age sixteen. We think that all of these are probably bigger decisions than choosing to have sex. So at that point we think that the law should be consistent. Basically, if people are being given a high amount of authority to make decisions about their own lives, we think that those decisions should be free for them to make across the board. I don't see why someone who is emotionally and physically mature enough to drive a car or serve in the nation's military shouldn't also be allowed to engage in a consensual sexual relationship. It just seems that if the government is saying that that person's judgment is good enough for one, it should clearly be good enough for the other. We think that the possibility for a third party harms or great personal risk from people choosing to have consensual sex is much lower, honestly, than driving much less getting married or serving in the military. So we think that at that point that the government should be consistent and lower the age of consent to sixteen across the board. And the other team might say well, it's only in america that people can do these things when they're so young. But we still think that it's clear that sixteen year olds in different countries around the world probably have similar levels of emotional maturity. What might be the case is that there's not enough sexual education in some parts of the world for young people to fully understand things like STDs or the risk of pregnancy and how to use contraception. But we think that in that case it would be better to facilitate access to that information and access to contraception rather than just to ban any sort of sexual activity. Because we don't think that's ever going to be effective. There's no way to stop young people from having sex and the law should take that into account. And even if it might be preferable for some people's, you know, moral or religious beliefs that young people didn't have sex at the point where they will the law should be pragmatic and acknowledge that and try to protect young people from unforeseen legal consequences like ending up on a sex offender registry and to provide information and contraceptives and things like that so that they can be safe. So for these reasons we would lower the age of consent.
We should abolish foster care. So, foster care is a system in which a minor who doesn't have legal guardians is given over to the care of some other individual. Usually, people volunteer to be foster parents. So, with that in mind, we think that this program, which is very common in the US and some other countries, as opposed to having orphanages, should be banned. Our first argument is that there are many harmful incentives underlying the foster care system that lead to pernicious abuse. Before I get into these points, the main argument I foresee the other side making against orphanages is that they are the site of widespread abuse. But actually, a large percentage of foster parents do not treat their foster children well and many foster children are also victims of abuse, but there's at the same time very little oversight because it's so decentralized. So we think that foster care actually leads to a huge amount of abuse and that it's more difficult to combat this than to combat it in centralized orphanages. Here's why: you get paid to take in foster children. What this means is that the kind of people who tend to adopt foster children are people looking for an easy paycheck rather than people who really care about the well-being of the children that they take in. Whereas it cost a fortune to be an adoptive parent, you actually profit from having foster children. So people try to spend less money than they receive from the government on their foster children so that they turn a profit, and also have an incentive to provide very low quality of life to these children in order to save money. So they do things like take in several children, too many for their home to really comfortably accommodate, and make them live in basically the same conditions that they would live in at an orphanage or even worse. They are hesitant to spend money on them for things like education or healthcare or other necessities, and ultimately these children live with a very low quality of life. Many of these foster parents are not very kind to their foster children, and we think that ultimately this is a really harmful environment for these children to be in, because there's every reason to be abusive and to mistreat these children when they're just a paycheck at the end of the day. Our second argument is that fostering is a poor use of state resources. So, any government or jurisdiction, whether it be a city or a nation, has limited funds to spend on providing for orphans. So what's the most effective way that we can provide for these children? So, first of all, we have to consider that centralizing them into group homes which are run by the state is going to have a return much greater than putting them in foster homes, because we can provide resources to more children at once. In other words, if you have a group home, then spending a few thousand dollars on a health clinic is likely to go farther than giving money for every individual foster parent to take their child to the doctor, because you can bring the doctor to them. Similarly, if you need to provide clothes or food or other services, it's easier to do that and less expensive to do that if you have more people centralized in one location. It's also easier to monitor and prevent abuse, because while it's true that the children might be at the mercy of whoever works at this group home, ultimately you can afford to do things, like regular checkups by an outside observer, at a group home at a much cheaper rate than what you could do for individual foster children who might only see their case worker very seldom. What's more, while it's true that there might be problems with the children mistreating each other at a group home, we think that with modern amenities, it should be easier to help children get along. We can afford to do things like give them smaller rooms rather than have them be in huge dorms, and it would still be cheaper than paying individuals to raise these children, who expect to make some sort of profit. So for all of these reasons, we should abolish foster care. Thank you.
We should privatize national parks. On our side, we're going to argue that national parks should be auctioned off to private operators. We're fine with setting certain restrictions on how they can use those parks, such as requiring them to operate as non-profits or to operate for the benefit of the public but, at the end of the day, we think that private groups could probably run them better than government. Our first argument, unsurprisingly, is that governments are inefficient at operating these parks. Because government bureaucracies are so large and so abstracted away from the people that they're helping, we think that, oftentimes, they don't know that much about a local area or have that much incentive to take care of any one park. This means that if we were to send them off to local administration that it's much more likely that people who really care about that park and who really care about the community around it and the nature within it would run them and, therefore, that every park would get the attention that it needs, something that's oftentimes sorely lacking right now, as national park services tend to focus only on the parks that draw lots and lots of tourists from all around the world. Our second argument is that this would increase investment in individual parks. We think that these groups that would come to run parks privately would have much more of an incentive to advertise than the park service does. If you advertise, then it's most likely that more people will go to parks in general. Right now, governments don't tend to push parks very hard, except for a few parks that are very popular, such as yellowstone in the united states, and therefore, as a result, many people don't even know about the parks that they have access to or the resources that are available to them. We think that these groups that would be advertising would then attract much more attention to the parks and, as a result, that more people would be willing to invest money, whether that be because they fall in love with the beautiful nature and want to invest in keeping it pristine and clean, or whether because local businesses see an opportunity to boost their standing in the community by becoming a sponsor of the park. The impact of all this is that we think that much more funding overall would be available for parks if they were managed privately rather than by the state. Government funds are always going to be limited because people are just unwilling to pay higher taxes, and because governments have bigger concerns than national parks, like welfare and the military. But these purpose-driven groups that only care about one thing, namely, promoting the interest of this one particular park or a small number of parks in one area, would likely do a much better job attracting investment and then using that money to actually benefit this particular park. We think that this would be good because you get a sort of virtuous cycle, where the park is improved and then more people visit, so then there's more money available and then it's improved even more, and that this could be really good for things like wildlife conservation and preservation, for educational opportunities for people to learn more about nature or to go into conservation programs, etcetera. So, ultimately, this could be something that's beneficial for these parks in many ways. But, finally, our third argument is that this would be really good for local economies as well. We already mentioned how this can draw an investment. And if you're investing a lot in a park, it's likely that you're creating jobs not only within the park, but also to serve the greater interest. If you double the number of people who visit a relatively sparsely visited park, now another hotel or lodge has to open. Now there have to be restaurants for those people to eat at. Now there's gotta be a gas station that's open twenty four hours so that people who are arriving early can get gas. So you're creating a lot of jobs in a secondary market as well as the jobs that you create directly. And think about where these parks tend to be. Oftentimes, they're in very rural areas that don't have a lot of economic opportunity. So I think this could benefit a lot of people who are really struggling in the status quo. For all these reasons, we should privatize national parks. Thank you.
The motion for today's debate is that we should end mandatory retirement. Two main reasons. The first, that we think this is age based discrimination, and thus ought be ended for protective reasons. We think that in the end, if you're a bad worker, the corporation is able to kick you out, because you are unproductive, or a nuisance in the office, or any number of other claims that they can make against you. But there is nothing inherent about your age that means that you shouldn't be doing a job. The comparative is this. We think that if a seventy year old person is being just as productive as a twenty year old in the same position, the seventy year old one shouldn't be kicked out just because they are too old, as dictated by by the corporation or the state. More than this though, we think this is comparative oftentimes to other kinds of characteristics that people get discriminated against. We think that in the same way that people cannot control their aging, people also cannot control their gender, and if we're protecting for things like race and gender discrimination in the workplace, you should also be protecting for things like age based discrimination. But on a deeper level, we think this is personally important as well. We think that in the end, you as an individual know better than any corporation what you are capable of and what is best for you. If they are doing this for reasons of you being too old, we think this is unjust paternalization, because they are making assumptions about your capabilities based purely on your age without considering other factors. We think in the same way that pregnant women are different from each other in regards to the productivity that they can do, or how hard like how hard they can work, in the same way that pregnancy affects every single person differently, age does too. Just because one seventy year old is, quote unquote, too old to work, actually cannot work anymore because of age related side effects, other seventy year olds are not the same. We think that you can evaluate when you need to step down yourself, but you can also evaluate your current monetary need better than anyone else can. We think it's incredibly problematic when corporations can dismiss people for being too old in times when those people are likely to need money most. We think that retirement plans oftentimes don't compensate people very well, and if you are dismissed from a fairly high paying job, you're always going to be seeing a decrease in standard of living as well. This is problematic, because a lot of the time people have their expenditures planned out, but also as you get older you often get sicker or have other expenditures that you also have to take care of, that younger people don't. Things like more often do you have to go to the hospital and get checkups, especially if you're a woman, things like breast cancer checkups, for men, things like prostate cancer checkups, all of these things don't start until you are much older. Second area of clash has to do with why we don't think this is going to be very bad for the like we don't think that the other side's reasons are like particularly justified, and more so, we think there are often upsides pragmatically to why this is good. We think that a lot of what the other side is going to say is oh no, but young people need to get these jobs and old people are keeping them up. Two responses. First, we think there is no reason why young people deserve that job more than you, if you have a high level of productivity and they are unlikely to outwork you. More than this though, we think that oftentimes these are in these are these are in situations where these young people are going to be able to find a different job but you are going to be stuck in retirement. What this means is that we ought value older people in these situations more than youth. More than this though, we think that in a world, especially certain states such as the united states, where the amount of old people are growing much much faster than the amount of young people replacing them, we think decreasing the number of dependents is incredibly important both for individual youth and also for the system at large. We think that a lot of the time the social security system just isn't strong enough to bear the weight of people who are getting older fairly quickly, and thus rely and thus relying on the system, not for reasons of their own incapability, but rather for reasons of why the corporation wants them out based on their age. Decreasing dependence is good because it means that there are less strains on the social security system, which means that in the future there will be more money there for those who will get older later. For these reasons, proud to propose.
The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce year round school. Or modeling this distinctly in the united states, given that we know that many other countries have already implemented this. We think this would look something like three week breaks every two months, but you would consistently have school. Like there wouldn't be a designated summer vacation that is multiple months long and so it would be as year round as possible. Two main areas of clash: the first on why it's better for students. First under this we want to talk about why students are infinitely less likely to forget things on our side of the house. Because in the status quo there's this massive issue were students leave the school for three months and they stop reviewing stuff, and they stop learning new things. And because they're not practicing they begin to forget all of the material that they've been building up through the course of the year. And as such people go back to school and get like very jarred and very like shaken back into like the rest of their lives. Right? They have to spend weeks reviewing previous material, which is like wasted essentially, they struggle to get back because they've forgotten how to study or what they're studying. And we think that a world in which we make it easier on students and reduce their stress is really good insofar as we've actually found a lot of long term studies that show that students who are more under stress do things like function less effectively, are more prone to getting sick in the future and things like that. We also think that there's a certain argument here about preparation for the real world. Insofar as the purpose of school is to take individuals completely unprepared to deal with reality and make them ones that can, we think that summer vacations fundamentally violate that purpose insofar as there are no summer vacations once you graduate and have a real job. We think that school should mimic that, otherwise they're fundamentally underperforming in what they're designated to be doing by not preparing individuals for the real world. Our second area of clash is about maximizing the efficiency of the school system and education. Because recognize that the USA is massively falling behind other countries in primary school education. Students are comparatively underperforming on most standardized tests in most areas that are deemed important. Like we've been doing awfully in mouth for a very long time, like very fundamental areas. And many other countries have already adopted these kinds of policies where it's been fully functional. Like I'm pretty sure the netherlands and sweden are countries that have year round school, and the entire world hasn't collapsed yet. We also think it's really important to note that having year round school keeps from wasting a lot of school resources that currently are. Like at the point that a teacher has to do half a semester worth of review every time that students come back from summer vacation, we think that it's a lot of time wasted that wouldn't have to be wasted if you had a year round school. Like it's a problem that at the beginning of every history class you have to go over like the most recent american history. At the beginning of every social studies class you have to go over the fundamental workings of the court. Like these are things that students should just know coming in and it wastes a lot of valuable time and a lot of valuable knowledge to have to review this every single time. So we think that that's fundamentally inefficient and shouldn't be happening. But more on the the but more than this, the fact that these buildings stay empty for months on end every time these people take break for the summer is really bad. Right? Like we think that it's more good when you're not just actively allowing school resources to lay around empty. We also think there's an important argument here. Like a lot of the time summer just means that parents have to find a way to occupy their kids. And this is really difficult for anyone who has people parents who are working. Or if you're a family in poverty who can't afford to just send your kid to a summer camp. And so we think that providing children with unstructured free time that places the burden on parents to entertain them and make sure that they're not out like being hooligans, is really bad for the retention of individuals in trust and like safety and things like that. And we think that school can serve as a meaningful structuring of time there given that parents shouldn't have to do that. For these reasons, proud to propose.
Urbanization does more harm than good. So by urbanization we mean the process by which people leave rural areas and move to large cities and towns. We see that this is a process that has occurred throughout human history but is rapidly accelerated throughout the twentieth and early twenty first century. Most people today now live in an urban area, which is a big change from a hundred years ago, and the concentration of people in urban areas is likely to rapidly increase according to UN metrics. So we have two big arguments for why we think this is ultimately worse than it is good. First of all we think that urbanization leads to a breakdown of social structures. Most people around the world rely on family networks throughout their lives in order to support themselves when they need help. For instance if you are a young mother and you need to work you can rely on a cousin, or aunt, or some other member of your extended family to do things like childcare, and to help you out. We think that people can rely on families help much more unconditionally then they can rely on the help of others, often because there's a sort of tit for tat nature and an expectation that if, as a young person say, you take advantage of your family's help in the future you will get back to this community. We see that this is lost though if your young people move to the city because that's generally how organization works. We see lots and lots of young men moving to cities. Relatively few elderly women, for instance, moving to cities. So at that point people are taking and taking and taking from these networks as children and then abandoning them without doing they're just dues when they go to a city. So these networks fall apart for a couple of reasons. One, because the people are actually leaving and can't participate and two, because the expectation of a return on your investment, so to speak, is lost. Why help out the children in your family if you think that they're just going to leave and go to the capital as soon as they get old enough to? So we think that this causes a breakdown in a really powerful support network that can really help people when they fall on hard times. Individuals who don't have access to a lot of government support, like people living in developing countries, might have family as their only support network but it's undermined by urbanization. In the same way we think that traditional culture is often lost. If your traditional beliefs require that you travel to a certain area or that you communicate with a certain religious leader and you live hundreds of miles away in a big city, we think that you're unlikely to be able to continue that. We also don't think that you're going to replace this culture with something better. Instead we think it's likely that you will continue to practice some sort of base form of your old culture that loses much of its meaning without the place in which it was set, or that you will completely give up on your local culture and instead participate in global westernized culture. We think that ultimately this leads to people adopting american and western culture and abandoning their own traditional culture which has the effect of making everyone around the world more or less the same and eliminating the diversity that makes the world such an interesting place to live. So our second argument is about what we think broadly speaking this will be to lower quality of life for the people moving to cities. This isn't really a debate about people moving from, say, rural america to new york city because highly developed countries have already urbanized to an extremely high degree and are unlikely to organize further. We think that this is a debate more about people moving from rural morocco to the slums around marrakesh. Recognize that many of the world's largest cities are now in developing countries but that most of the people who live in them don't live in the really fancy nice areas that tourists see if you visit these areas. They live in slums that are kind of out of sight and out of mind and this is where urbanization is growing. It's not lots and lots of people moving into nice apartments in high rise buildings. Its people living in little shanty towns reminiscent of america in the great depression. These areas are rife with disease and poverty and crime and little opportunity for people to advance themselves or care for their families. We think that in rural life you have many more opportunities to feed yourself, to fall back on your community, but because people are lured to the city on false pretenses and expectations partially based on hollywood, partially based on lies told to them by potential employers, that ultimately you will be better off staying in the countryside than moving to a city. For these reasons we think that urbanization does more harm than good.
I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion, that we should ban casinos. I think the model here is pretty intuitive, we just ban places where people gamble money, you know, we can do a staff task for this sort of thing, to figure out what exactly constitutes gambling, we would also be comfortable banning things like online gambling, and like non site gambling as well, we think this is well within the spirit of the motion. So, two independent points under this, first that gambling addiction is a serious problem, and by banning the venues at which gambling can occur, we can meaningfully mitigate the scope of this issue, and secondly, the economic problems that are created by casinos, particularly within the local areas that they are built. So first, on addiction: we would say that the existence of casinos, or any location where gambling can occur in a regulated fashion, facilitates gambling addictions. This is I think pretty intuitive why gambling addictions are bad, generally being addicted to anything is bad, insofar as it definitionally forces the victim to engage in irrational and unhealthy behavior. But gambling addiction particularly is something, that causes larger financial dreams on the individual, has a large externalities on their families or loved ones. We think this is something that causes a lot of suffering to people, and necessarily it would be good to mitigate the extent of that. So, casinos facilitate this, in the sense that you have to actually go somewhere to gamble, that you have to gamble with something, but casinos particularly are more pernicious than just, like, individual like day to day interactions, or small gambles, because the serial nature of a casino, that is that you could blow like thousands of dollars in a very short amount of time, makes it very easy for the worst cases of gambling addiction to blossom into something, that is the worst possible iteration of a gambling addiction. So, we would say then, that basically as a spike to arguments about what, like, black markets are worse, that this is a special instance, in which black markets are unlikely going to be worse than the status quo, a, because the status quo is already pretty awful, but secondly, because the black market for gambling is so tiny, because it's very very difficult to organize like a large operation, where people have to engage in this illegal activity for hours at a time. So, realistically the comparative is just so much smaller in scope, that that the lack of regulation probably isn't going to make up, for just how much smaller the industry would be in an illegal market. The second independent point we have is how casinos are economically harmful, particularly for their communities. We would say this plays out in four ways, first is that the tourism, that people often cite as a benefit of casinos, is zero sum. It detracts from the other tourist attractions people will be spending their time out of the neighboring areas, and because casinos are generally these all inclusive things, were you like never have to leave the facility, there's very little were recirculation of money into the local area. So, if someone were to go to see like, I don't know, the woods, or something, and you're like upstate new york area, where you're considering buying a casino, they might, you know, favor local restaurants or things like that. They won't do that if it's a casino though. Secondly, the proceeds from casinos generally go outside of the area where they're built, to wealthy investors, stake holders, that sort of thing. Third, gambling is just an economically inefficient thing, that like the actual model of how a casino works is that you spend a lot more money than you get back. So, that money is drained from the economy, exacerbates income inequality, by moving that money out of the poor areas, that generally are forced to consider building casinos in the first place, and puts it into the pocket of generally people in urban areas, that don't have these things. Fourth is that externalities like traffic, that are generated by the casino, make the region less attractive to non gamblers, and then detract from the other forms of tourism they would generally get, because people don't want to have to deal with the issues created by the presence of the casino. So, while on paper it looks like: oh, this casino is going to like bring a lot of people into the area, most reasonably, they're a, not going to benefit the local economy very well, b, mostly going to benefit people that already have lots of money, and c, are going to actively harm the other things, that are keeping your economy on track in the first place. For all these reasons, proud to propose.
We should end progressive taxation. So progressive taxation is, generally speaking, a tax on income wherein people who earn more money will pay a higher rate of tax. The way that this works in the US, and I believe many other countries, is that the first six thousand dollars you make is tax free, the next six thousand dollars you make is taxed at a fairly low rate like five percent, and then as you make more and more money, the money earned above a certain amount is taxed at a higher rate. So even if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year, the first six thousand dollars is untaxed, for instance. You can think of it as a sort of series of buckets where as money overflows from one bucket into another, you have a higher rate of taxation. This is in place in most US states and in most countries around the world. Our first argument against progressive taxation is that it is unfair and arbitrary. People who are very wealthy benefit the same amount from public services as people who are not very wealthy. At that point we don't think they should have to pay more money in than anyone else. For instance, everyone benefits from having streets and police officers, yet the poor drive on the same streets as the rich. Why should the rich therefore pay a much greater percentage of their income than the poor? We think that this burden falls unfairly on those groups. The other team is going to get up here and tell you that the marginal value of a dollar is much higher for a poor person than a rich person. But at that point we tell you, that it's not up to the state to determine the marginal value of a dollar to any individual citizen, that people know their own interests better than the government knows them and that we ought defer to people's knowledge of themselves rather than the state's ideas about how much money is worth to them. We also think that the income brackets are completely arbitrary. In the united states for instance we've often seen politician shuffle around income brackets, change who pays how much, raise taxes on the middle, lower, or upper classes in order to suit their voting bases. This effectively just becomes a form of cronyism where people vote in groups that will lower their tax bracket and raise the amount of tax that other people pay. We think that a flat tax would ultimately be less corrupt and less arbitrary. Our second argument is that this creates needlessly complicated tax codes. Right now in the united states as I mentioned earlier, the brackets themselves are fairly complicated. But on top of that, in order to avoid paying higher rates of tax, people will go to extreme lengths to actually put themselves into certain tax brackets. This might mean investing in fake investment vehicles or just refusing income because people don't want to pay tax at a higher rate. There are lots of perverse incentives against people actually being productive, which is in the end, what's best for the economy. So we think that this is an unnecessarily complex tax code that hurts the economy. But it also provokes lots of tax evasion because it's so complicated. We think that if you want to actually collect more tax, you should make it harder for people to evade their tax burden and that a flat tax would be simpler and easier to detect fraud. Our third argument is that ultimately, a progressive income tax actually ignores people's ability to pay. Why is this true? Wealth is not taxed progressively if it's taxed at all. Sure many areas have property taxes but these are almost always flat. We tell you that ultimately wealth is a more important factor than income. Someone could be a doctor or name lots and lots of income but have no personal wealth because they have lots of debt from medical school. While the child of some millionaire might have very little income but have very valuable property. We tell you that at that point, the person with the greater ability to pay and contribute to society is the person with lots of property not the person with lots of debt and that at that point, because progressive income taxes ignore the burden that people have in the form of debt, or ignore mitigating factors with regard to their income, that ultimately they're unfair. We should therefore end progressive taxation. Thank you.
We should abolish personality tests. So, by this we mean we should ban the use of these personality tests in any form, particularly for hiring or government or educational use, but we think that the place where they're most commonly used in the status quo would be in hiring. And by personality test, we mean things like myers briggs test that claim to analyze your personality based on a short questionnaire and determine what type of person you're going to be and then oftentimes, employers will only hire people who receive a certain results because they think that they'll be better workers or that other people might be unreliable or otherwise undesirable because of their personality test. Now, there's some amount of psychological support from the scientific community for the use of these tests to determine what type of person someone is, but we're going to give you two arguments for why we don't think they ought be used: so, our first point is that we think that these tests are unfair to the test taker in the hiring process. We think, first of all, that they require you to reveal personal details that your employer otherwise couldn't ask for about you. We think that your employer couldn't ask you, for instance, if you were the type of person who would want children or if you were the type of person who would want to get married and things like that, but that these questions might very well be included in the personality test and so, indirectly you're giving your employer access to information that they might not be permitted to ask for in another situation. So, we don't think that the employer ought be allowed to do that. We think it's unfair to the person applying. We also think that these tests don't affect your ability at your job. It might be possible that a person might have a myers personality type that's not traditionally associated with being a good lawyer, say, but that this individual happens to be a very good lawyer despite having a certain myers personality type. We think that it's unfair to someone who has put in a lot of work to cultivate skills and to get an education and otherwise to build themselves up for a given career, to rule them out of it based not on their merits, but based only on their personality type. Aside from that, we tell you that personality type may very well very from day to day and not be representative. It's possible that on a given day, someone feels more introverted or more extroverted or that a person feels more positive or more negative. We think particularly in the interview process when people are under a great deal of stress, it's likely that they'll act differently than they would if they weren't under that kind of stress and that ultimately, therefore, these tests are not representative of that person's true nature, even if the outcome of the test is actually representative of who they would be normally. They're just not in a scenario where they're able to take that test fairly. And if these results are legitimate, then we don't think they're something that an individual can control. I didn't choose my myers type, so we shouldn't discriminate against people based on it, in the way that we don't discriminate against people based on other things that are, largely speaking, out of their control, such as race or sex or gender. Our second argument is about why we think the use of these tests is actually harmful for employers: first of all, false negatives are likely to screen out good candidates. So, if you don't want to hire people of x personality type and someone happens to be get the result of x, even if that's not really their personality type and they were a really good candidate for the job, then you're screening out someone who would've been the best employee, simply because the tests aren't perfectly accurate. We also think that the outcome of using these personality tests will be that you'll hire less talented people who did well on a certain test. So now, suddenly, you're screening people not based on how good a lawyer they are, but by what their myers type is and we don't think that always corresponds one-to-one with being a good lawyer the same way that things like records and skills do. We think moreover, that you're likely to end up with one type of thinker if you screen out other personality types. If you only look for one or two myers types that you hire, then you're going to exclude people who think differently and this might make you less innovative and less competitive than you would be if you had a more diverse group of people and personality-wise. And we think that the big impact of all of this is that this damages your business compared to if you had hiring that was based only on recommendations and resumes and experience, like traditional hiring processes that's more focused on the actual job that the person would do. So, for these reasons, we should abolish personality tests.
Recall elections are beneficial. So, by this we mean a system in which, let's say you had the governor of a US state, and that person was doing a poor job and citizens wanted to recall them. They would first have a referendum that would work like a normal referendum in order to determine if they wanted to recall the governor, and then if they voted to recall him, they would replace him using whatever technique they would normally use to fill an empty seat, so maybe, the lieutenant governor would become the new governor, or maybe they would have a gubernatorial election in that state. So, we think that, broadly speaking, it would be as similar as possible to the current system but adding a way for people to recall governors, members of parliament, and other government officials who are elected in the status quo. And we would like to see this apply to all elected officials. So, our first argument is about accountability. We think that a huge problem right now is that the interests of politicians are not aligned with the interests of their constituents. It's very easy for a politician to tell lies on the campaign trail, and say that they're going to do x, y and z as soon as they get into office, and then turn around and do something completely different because they're not held very accountable. If elections are five years apart like they are in britain for members of parliament, or six years apart, like for american senators, most people probably can't remember what the issues were that the person ran on in the first place when they were first elected, so people aren't held accountable, or the political sphere has changed so much that those are no longer relevant and they're not held accountable. We think that, furthermore politicians are able to get away with a lot of abuse that you couldn't get away with in the private sector. Things like, british members of parliament taking advantage of their expense accounts for unofficial businesses, or poor job performance even many, mps don't show up for votes, many american senators also don't show up for votes, many governors don't bother to try to pass laws, and ultimately they don't do the things that they're supposed to do. You would get fired from a regular job if you didn't do what you were meant to do. So we think that there should be a similar mechanism to be sure the politicians actually care, and that in this way you align their interest to those of voters because the only way for them to get job security is to do what's good for the voters or what voters want from them so now they have the same interests. Our second argument is about political engagement. We think that right now, there's not a lot of reason to stay informed for most people in non-election years. So if your country has parliamentary elections every five years, people probably follow the news much more closely in an election year and then, become less and less invested in the off years. But if you know that there's a potential that you can punish politicians for their wrong doings, we think you have more of an incentive to stay informed, and more of a reason to actually care about what's going on day to day even if a lot of it seems kind of abstract from your everyday life. We think also that people will feel more control over the political process and that this is a good thing. If people feel, in other words, like they matter as a citizen and like they have the ability to change things, then they're more likely to have faith in the government, and more likely to want to participate in things like off year elections and referenda. We tell you that we do this by having recall elections because it's very obvious how you affect the government if you're able to take people out of government for doing a poor job. A lot of the things that people are asked to do to participate in government are sort of abstract. You vote to fund something or you vote to allow someone to do something in parliament, but you don't have a lot of direct control over the people who represent you. We give you that kind of direct control and we think that this will make people feel more invested in their government. Lastly, we think that you get a better politician citizen dialogue, so there's not a ton of reason why you're not campaigning for reelection for a politician to spend much time with their constituents, hearing about their concerns, and representing their interests. We think that you're a lot more likely to try to have a good relationship with your constituents and to spend a lot of time there rather than in the capital if you know that they can recall you if they're unhappy with the job that you're doing. So we think that there actually is more accountability for this reason also, and that this leads to more engagement between these elite politicians and everyday ordinary people. Who would be voting in a recall election. So we think recall elections are beneficial because they lead to more accountability and better political engagement. Thank you.
We should privatize postal services. In the status quo, our current public postal services are a massive waste of government money. Maybe when they first arose, certainly when they first arose, they were an incredibly useful tool for people to have access to. It was incredibly useful for spreading information. It was one of the only ways of spreading information and transporting goods between private individuals. But now we have systems of other shipping services that are able to outcompete the US postal service and other public postal services and are simply more popular. If you're the average individual, you're probably more likely to go to a shipping giant like fedex or UPS than you are the US postal service. We think that you can have a short-term federal contract to run the US postal system and in the long run, you can assess the need for the USPS altogether and potentially transition away from having any sort of public spending on postal services. So, first, we think that privatization incentivizes removing waste. In the status quo, there are a number of postal hubs, a number of post offices in which very little mail is actually delivered, in which the vast majority of delivery that is done from house to house is sending spam through the mail from companies that are trying to advertise. We think that when you have competition for these contracts, for these federal contracts, people compete in a way the way that people compete for those contracts is by offering lower pricing. It's by coming up with a system in which they can do which in which they can do more for less money. It's and this is how they outcompete other firms. As private entities, you're also just more willing to make hard decisions like layoffs, because public backlash is less direct. It's less impactful. If you're a congressperson voting on whether or not we're going to cut spending for the US PS, well, if you have a major postal hub in your district, you're not going to vote against that because it means your your constituents are going to be laid off. But if you're a private business, you while you may care about the workers that you have, you're more concerned with the bottom line, and public backlash is not going to have as large of an impact on your actual standing within a company, within the firm. We also think that there's wide-scale public postal services, that wide-scale public postal services are largely unnecessary. Firstly, with the rise of the internet in the past two decades, sending letters, actual letters, over the mail, like communicating with an individual through the mail, has become immensely obsolete. The telephone already made this mostly obsolete but, nowadays, if you want to get in touch with a person, no one thinks to use the postal service. No one thinks to send a letter. The only time you send a letter to someone might be if you're sending a birthday card or a christmas card or something like that, but no one actually tries to communicate anymore via the mail. There's also the rise of other carriers, as I mentioned earlier. Carriers like US- like UPS and fedex are able to do the same types of shipments in the same time scales for less money. There's also a rise of private delivery by business. So companies like amazon do their own delivery nowadays, which means a huge bulk of traffic that could otherwise be going to the postal service is being done privately by thes firms. So many many operators, many businesses don't need postal services at all. And finally, we think there's a large potential use of the gig economy to deliver mail locally. If you can have an a system like uber or lyft in which people essentially have a taxi system that's run through the gig economy, we don't understand why mail delivery can't function in the same way. For these reasons, we should privatize postal services.
We should ban anonymous posts. So, a quick overview: we think that this debate is generally about websites and about online anonymous posts. We're not going to talk about like editorials and newspapers or anything like that. We just want to keep this debate to be we want to keep this debate clear. We're banning this type of stuff, this type of anonymous posts on internet forums, social media, et cetera, and the regulation is going to be on the rights on the sites themselves. So we think that it would be a regulation that's put in place that would fine a website for allowing anonymous posts and things like that. All right. Two big arguments here. The first is that we think this creates a check on free speech, which is very important, and the second is that this decreases bullying. So, firstly, that talk about free speech. We think that free speech is a crucial right to give people. It allows for self-expression, which allows people to learn about their own identities and to find other people that that have similar identities and to form collectives that are really that allow people to self-actualize, allow people to internalize value. It garners an open space to air political and social ideas, which we think help society progress as a whole, and it also increases the general knowledge. Having free speech allows us to spread information and allows knowledge to be spread across a wide base. We also think there's a huge risk that comes with free speech. It allows anyone to share any thoughts that they have, whether those thoughts are true or not and whether those thoughts are kind or not. We think anonymity to the scale of the internet has never been seen before in human history. The ability to simply post something anonymously on the web on on a website in a way that allows you to garner thousands or potentially millions of views on that thought has never been possible before. Sure, you could anonymously post into a newspaper, you could anonymously publish something on a flyer and leave it in public, but this just isn't the same type of anonymity that we're talking about today, this widespread collective anonymity that that exists in our world. We think that the attachment between a name and an idea is a check on the worst-case scenario that could arise from giving free speech. And we think that what we've done in our modern society is eliminated that check through things like social media, and other anonymous online forums for spreading our ideas, and many people do not want to have those their names attached to their worst thoughts, to their worst ideas. We think that banning anonymous posting, banning this type of anonymity would do a massive good in reining in the harms that have come from free speech, especially in the last decade or two with the rise of the internet, and we think that this would do more for allowing a more social consciousness to arise amongst the internet users and allow for a more tame internet use. And so, we're going to talk about decreasing bullying, because I think that's a specific application for anonymity and how that comes to harm us in a really tangible way. It's a huge problem in the world, especially for adolescents, cyberbullying, that is. And we think it's easy to do because it can be anonymous, there's no repercussions, for example, in a school system, in the same way that if you do something publicly, there are those repercussions. We think that this is tangibly seen. Teen suicides and depression are way up compared to past generations. Your online reputation and your identity are very important to someone that has come of age in this time period where where technology and the internet are synonymous with our everyday activities. We think that banning anonymity protects children in two ways. It prevents them from being bullied in the first place, and it ensures that people that are bullying get caught when they do bully. It ensures that you have some sort of check that you can put through the school system. And given in the past, that we were able to prevent these types of things on a wide scale, we were able to prevent teen suicide and these high rates of depression, we think that removing the the potential for anonymity, removing the potential for widespread cyberbullying of an individual without ever holding anyone accountable is an important way of checking the harms that we see. We think that the same types of benefits can be gained across generations and across different social spheres, and this is just a particular application of why we should ban anonymous posts.
ADHD management brings more good than harm. So I think what this debate is really about is whether or not the use of medications like ritalin and adderall to treat ADHD, especially for children, is a good thing. And I think the wording of the topic necessarily means that this is comparative. There's going to be some benefits and some drawbacks and both sides should acknowledge that, and we're talking about which is ultimately more important and which outweighs the other. So we're going to talk first about why we think these treatments allow people with ADHD to lead more fulfilling lives. So recognize that ADHD is an illness. It's not that different than having a physical ailment. And when people have a physical ailment that prevents them from working or going to school or living fulfilling lives we treat that ailment. Even if there are drawbacks. You know wearing a cast on a broken arm makes it more difficult to play soccer, say, but in the long run it'll make you better off and more able to participate in society so we're okay with that temporary drawback. I think that for many people ADHD treatments work in a similar way. Particularly for children there might be some drawbacks in terms of their ability to focus and succeed outside of school or some potential social harms to taking these medications but in the long term because they're able to get an education they're able to work and support themselves and help others better on our side. So we think that particularly with educational success, many children with ADHD struggle to succeed in schools and not only did they struggle to succeed in their classes but they take away resources from other children because they demand more attention from educators. So we think that these children and anyone else who's in class with them are better off if they're receiving treatment in the long term in terms of receiving educational success. And this extends into the workplace as well. Of course if people are educated and they're better able to get a job but also if you're receiving treatment and you're better able to succeed at that job, to train others to be productive, to help your company or whoever you work for and ultimately be a productive member of society in that respect as well. We also think that your mental health is likely to be better. Because people who struggle to find employment or to succeed educationally often experience anxiety or depression and we think that those can be mitigated by giving people the tools they need to succeed in work and education and that often means treating their ADHD. So in the long term, we think that people with ADHD can better lead fulfilling happy lives as a result of these treatments. So we think that they are something that's good on balance. Certainly some people have adverse reactions, but we think that if you look at the broad scope of millions of people who are affected by this illness, more people are going to benefit them be harmed. Our second point is on a more societal level. We've talked about the individual, what's good for people as a whole. So we think that many people who struggle with mental illness like ADHD struggle to participate in society. They have are hard time getting an education and getting a job so they're dependent on things like government support or rely on family members to care for them even into adulthood and in general are not able to thrive and succeed as well as they should otherwise. This is a tremendous cost because in order for society to provide for everyone in need everyone who's able bodied has to be able to work and to produce so that we can take care of those who can't support themselves. This means that treatments that allow people to be able bodied, to be able to help others are going to be a good thing and we think that ADHD treatments are a good example of this where people who might otherwise not be contributing as much to society as others are now able to contribute a great deal and that means that we can support people who can't contribute like children, like the disabled, like people in need. So I think that the comparative is much better off for people who can't help themselves. We also think that you reduce any social behaviors. If people can't succeed in the workplace, they're probably more likely to turn to crime and issues like that and we think that if you can reduce this by encouraging people to receive treatment for mental illness like ADHD that ultimately that's going to be good for society as well and make everyone safer. So in the long run we think that society will be better off as a result of ADHD management techniques like certain drugs like adderall and ritalin. So because this is good for individuals and for society we think that this does more good than harm. Thank you.
Recall elections are beneficial. In this debate, we're going to be talking about recall election, specifically in the form of individuals, being able to vote to repeal the election of a candidate, while their term is still on. So, this this usually occurs when people are dissatisfied with the current candidate, that has become their elected official, usually they haven't fulfilled certain campaign promises, things like this, and it leads to there being a recall vote, in which the entire voting population is able to vote as to whether or not the person will be able to keep their term in office, and continue to serve, and if they are recalled, or, if the vote is more than fifty percent, where they are disapproved of, then there's a new election, and a new process to find someone to fill in for that term. So, we're going to talk, primarily, about why did direct democracy, a direct democracy in this form is good, and why we think we get better political outcomes, which is ultimately the purpose of politics in the first place. So firstly, on direct democracy. We think that, recall elections are more principally just within a democratic system. Within democratic state, within a liberal state, the state can only be justified based on the consent of the people that are governed by, which is why that which is why we have the democratic elections that we have in the first place, it's to ensure that those that are being ruled, are ruled by those to which they have consented to ruling them, unlike the kings and monarchs of the past. We think that, more actions equals more opportunities to consent, because people don't get the opportunity to vote on day to day legislation, they don't get the the chance to vote on every bill that comes before state house. It means that, individuals when people elect candidates, it is their proxy for how policy is moving, its their proxy for how policy is done. We think that, more elections means more opportunity for for people to have the most direct impact on the policy making position. Elections are a much more concrete way of changing the policy direction, more concrete than giving money or giving donations to candidates, it's more concrete than writing to your legislature, or even having protests. We think that elections are the most direct, and most essential way to change policy. Further, we think that when individuals elect a candidate, that candidate runs on certain premises, the premises of campaign promises, of what that candidate intends to do while in office. At the point, at which the candidate has been unable to fulfill that promise, whether it is their fault or not that this is the case, we think that that is the point at which, the people are capable of making the decision to recall that candidate, because they bought into that candidate on false promises, on false expectations, and as the candidate is simply a proxy for what those people believe should be achieved in a policy sense, when that candidate doesn't fulfill those policies, it means that a new direction is entirely justified by the people. This is also why we think we get generally better outcomes, when you have recall elections. There's no objectively correct way, in which the government should run, or in which the state should function. The state exists to serve the ideas and the priorities of the people in that state, and once the state begin to act in ways that are not beneficial, ways that are possibly corrupt, in ways that benefit themselves, which we think is often the case, when people are put in a position of power, when there are individuals lobbying for them, individuals trying to get their attention, a revolving door that, allows them to get very lucrative jobs, after they've been in office, all these things are reasons why politicians may not have the people's best interests, and often don't have the people's best interest in mind. We think that, it is unfair to force the populace to continue to deal with a candidate that doesn't represent their ideals, that isn't bringing about the change, or the direction that they want to see, and the opportunity to recall that individual, to at least give the sign that, people are discontent with how the government is running, we think that this is a crucial part of democracy, and leads to people being more accountable to the promises they made, and leads the people more often getting the government they desire. For these reasons, we believe that recall elections are beneficial.
Casinos should be banned. So we think that this motion is fairly straightforward. We would say that within the state all casinos should be banned. Gambling itself we would say is a different topic but casinos are widespread gambling in one place in the way the casinos are set up, we would ban all of them. Alright we only have one main argument to make in this round but we think that is the most important argument in this debate and this is that in a factual sense, the gambling that takes place in casinos is rigged and that en masse it will always harm the people on net compared to the good that it does for some people that win. So why do we think that this is the most important argument before we explain it. We think that one of the primary focuses of the government is to make hard decisions for people when the government is more aware of the information and is more capable of making rational choices than the people are. We think that as a species humanity is incredibly bad at long term planning and in internalizing in in internalizing very complex ideas. One of those complex ideas are the odds of actually winning big at a casino. The actual odds and statistical likelihood of someone being successful weighed against the statistical likelihood of someone losing dramatically more money than they're likely to win. Given that people are bad at internalizing these values and that we know that casinos are set up in any number of ways to ensure that the house always wins, that they are a profitable system for casino owners and a not profitable system for casino patrons, we think that because the government is aware of these facts the government should step in and ban casinos and unlike other instances where you can ban something or you could regulate it to some immense degree, there's no regulation that can take place with a casino that's going to prevent it from having all of the harms of being rigged to favor the house. If you were to do that these casinos would just close on their own anyway because they wouldn't be profitable anymore and at that point you're basically banning them even if you're not outright banning them. So what do casinos actually do to ensure that they are always going to win? Casinos create a number of structures in the construction of those buildings in the way they construct the games to ensure they win. Despite on top of the odds in the way that the games themselves are built, they're also built to try and keep people in these casinos for as long as possible. You create buildings that don't allow you to see that it's dark outside or that the sun has come up or to know what's going on in the outside world so you're totally fixated on those casinos. They glamorize casinos so that people don't understand how likely they are to win. They show the winners and they lie and they deceive to the people through marketing about what these casinos could actually do for them and you make it easy for people to gamble far beyond your means. There's very little check in these casinos to see that someone has some sort of a problem and that they're losing not only their own money but the money that is necessary for people that that rely on them for family and friends and people that are close to them they lose their money as well. People are horrible long term planners and the state must step in in this instance to ensure that people don't harm those around them through gambling away what is most important to them, for gambling away their savings, the money that they've earned throughout their life. We think that at the end of the day, in a world in which casinos are banned the vast majority of people who would visit casinos regularly are going to be net better for their lives. They're going to have net more money. They're going to have lost fewer things. They're going to have burned fewer relationships than if those casinos had not been banned and we think when the government is making a decision about paternalism that is the key factor and because of this casinos should be banned.
We should abolish temporary employment. In this debate, when we're talking about employment, or temporary employment, we mean things like temp agencies that assign individuals, that are of low skill, to different sort of private sectors, in order for them to fill in for other people, that otherwise would have been in long term employment. We think that, things like seasonal workers would get long term contracts, and guaranteed contracts over the course of many years, and if you're going to have be some sort of a freelance, or a contractor, we think that, you would have to have some sort of a long term contract with guarantees, based on completion of work etcetera. So, not just at will employment, but firm contracts. Okay, so why do we think that temporary employment in the status quo is problematic? The first reason is that, there's a high a high amount of abuse amongst temporary workers. Firstly, because there is such a because these jobs are generally low skill labor jobs, because they are something that could be filled in by a wide variety of people that temp agencies may have to offer. We think that, these people are often the subject of very low wages, which means that they're doing jobs that, other people who would be working long time, or full time contracts, would be getting much higher wages for, simply because they aren't replaceable by an agency. But more importantly, this means that perspective long term and full term employment contracts would be undermined by the existence of these markets. We think that this means that, on balance you get fewer long term employment contracts, if you allow the the a option of temporary employment, temp agencies, to exist. There's also very little control, as a temp, over the schedule you're going to work, and very little control of your hours, which means your employer can determine if they're going to overwork you, or if they're going to give you a fewer hours in a week, which means it's very difficult for you to actually plan for your job, to have some sort of financial plan, in which you have a regular income, and a normalized income, that you can plan your spending around, which we think is necessary for people to avoid things, like bankruptcy, and to avoid things like overspending, which should have dramatic harms in the long run. You also rarely receive benefits and unpaid sick over time, unpaid sick time, all these things are regularly exploited through temporary employment, which people aren't given wages, and it only works to undercut a more competitive market, in which permanent employment, and long term contract employment, is the only norm. So the second reason why we should abolish temporary employment is that the jobs themselves are bad, in a functional sense, for the people. What we mean by this is that, because these are, firstly, very low skill employment, secondly, temporary, and therefore, have very few opportunities for advancement, and thirdly, because you're disassociated from your supervisor so greatly, it's very difficult to get things like referrals, and recommendations from previous employers, when trying to go to future jobs. These jobs don't don't build a productive resonate for individuals to move into the future. This means that, individuals are, on balance, less likely to get valuable skills, that they can use in other workplaces, and are less capable of using this time, in a way that will allow them to further benefit themselves in the future. Temp jobs and things like this are stagnant in their very nature. They don't allow for opportunities to advance, and we think that, by having temp jobs, it allows for band aid solutions to problems like poverty, and to problems like unemployment, because it allows people to be employed in the worst possible situations, in ways that stagnate their production, that stagnate their productive capabilities, but allows for numbers, like unemployment rates and jobs to be filled, that are necessary for society, that are necessary for the functioning of business, and it allows private corporations to undercut labor markets as well. Given that this is the case, and that the jobs are not beneficial to the people in the long run, nor are they good jobs to have in the short run, we think that we should abolish temporary employment.
Hunting should be banned. So we're going to argue that recreational hunting should not be allowed. We think that one way this could be implemented would be for states or jurisdictions not to issue hunting permits, or to change their law to require permits and then refuse to issue them. We have a few reasons why we think that hunting should not be permitted that we'll provide for you this evening. The first is that hunting is cruel to the animals. I'm sure the other side is going to talk about why sometimes it's necessary to limit animal populations. For instance, in the area where I grew up, there are too many white-tailed deer, and they're starving to death and eating all of the trees because there's not enough food for them, now there's no more wolves to kill them. But even in extraordinary circumstances like that, when we need to reduce the size of population of a certain animal, it is cruel to do this through hunting. Chasing animals through the forest and shooting at them, killing them slowly with shotguns is inhumane. There is no way that you can justify effectively killing these animals through fear and torment, rather than having trained professionals dispose of them in a healthy and sanitary and not terrific way. Ultimately, when you hunt these animals, their last few moments are spent running in fear from the hunter, and oftentimes they're killed in a very slow fashion, for instance, by a gun wound that isn't very clean, and then they bleed to death. We think that this is unacceptable and that ultimately we wouldn't accept people treating dogs or cats this way, so it's arbitrary to treat other animals differently. If you wouldn't be okay with someone chasing cats through your neighborhood and shooting at them, you shouldn't be okay with people treating deer this way either. Our second argument is that we think this promotes a more violent society. When people grow up hunting, we think that they are being conditioned to be more violent individuals. Most people would have a really difficult time killing a large animal with a gun. They simply aren't used to committing violence on any sort of scale. So if you raise people, especially from a young age, to believe that it's okay to kill animals with guns, then we think it's more likely they'll go on to kill people with guns in the future. After all, a certain amount of that taboo has been broken, and if you're used to killing a deer with a gun, it's a smaller step to killing a person versus if you had never grown up with that idea at all. But what's more, we also think it promotes a certain coarseness, where life is seen as something that can be exchanged for sport rather than something that is sacred. So we think that people who grew up hunting are less likely to respect the rights of animals or the value of lives that are very different from themselves. We think that it promotes people deadening their own empathy so that they're able to conduct the sport, but as a result that they lose out on empathy that would have been useful to them and for society in their everyday life. And our third and final point is that hunting is actually bad for wilderness preservation. I think the other side in this debate will try to argue that hunting leads to political will for promoting wilderness and animal populations, but it only promotes those things to the extent that they're beneficial for hunting. So animals that are useless to hunters are less likely to be protected as more resources are focused on animals that are useful to hunters. And similarly, environments that aren't good for hunting, such as marshes or wetlands, are less likely to be preserved than traditional hunting environments like forests. So we think that ultimately this leads to a wilderness preservation, but not the wilderness preservation that we really need. We would prefer that resources are allocated based on the need of that environment rather than based on what sportsmen want to see to improve the amount of fun that they can have on saturday mornings. So because it's cruel, because it promotes violence, and because it's harmful to preservation efforts, hunting should be banned. Thank you.
The blockade of the gaza strip should be ended. So for a little bit of context: for about ten years now, israel and egypt have closed off the gaza strip to the world. Over a million people live in the city of gaza, to say nothing of other settlements in the strip. Before the blockade, while the city had a lower standard of living than israel proper or than egypt, the standard of living was comparable to many other large cities in the middle east. Today, the city has a standard of living much lower than north korea and to say nothing of the fact that terror has actually continued at a higher rate during the blockade. So with that in mind, we have two main arguments for our side. The first is that the blockade has created an unacceptable humanitarian crisis. There is effectively no legal way to bring in food and medical supplies to gaza, which means that people depend entirely on smugglers to get basic things that they need to live, such as diapers, vegetables, or any sort of advanced medical supplies. These people are living in conditions that would be considered unacceptable in sub-saharan africa or in north korea, but they're doing it right next to a very wealthy country, namely, israel, that without this blockade could provide services to them. And moreover, many other countries, such as france, have tried to help people living in gaza and been prevented by the blockade. So we think that this is just unacceptable. Most people in gaza are living on less than two dollars a day right now, which means that it's actually a lower standard of living than almost any country in the world despite the fact that before this happened, the standard of living was relatively high. So we think that because people are starving, because they're dying because of a lack of access to medical supplies, because their children can't go to school and be educated, because they can't choose to leave even if they want to, that this is just unacceptable and that nothing like this should happen in the twenty-first century, that this is one of the grossest human rights abuses going on in the world today, and that it has to end. But our second argument is that this actually makes terror worse. The reason why the blockade went into effect is because hamas won the elections in gaza, which meant that you had a terrorist group in control of the gaza strip. But since the israelis and the egyptians blocked off access to gaza, we haven't seen hamas be weakened. They're still in power there. In fact, just today I read that they've officially entered a new agreement with fatah that seems likely to entrench their power even more going forward. But moreover, aside from the fact that this hasn't worked to end terror, it actually breeds more terror in the future, and here's why: the reason why people become terrorists is a lack of opportunity. The most dangerous thing in the world is lots of young men who don't have jobs, don't see any way to get jobs, and feel like the world has nothing to offer them. And the blockade has created exactly that situation. You have a hundred thousand young men about my age, who ought to be working and having babies and going to school, and instead what are they doing? They're living in awful conditions that they blame justly on israel and egypt, and the only people offering to change anything are terrorist groups like hamas. So, ultimately, it makes perfect sense that these young men will join hamas, will launch attacks on israel, will contribute to the problem with terror in the region. So if you want to end this terror, you need to give people economic opportunities, and the blockade makes that impossible. Even if young men in gaza want to go out and get jobs and have normal lives, they're not able to because of this blockade, which means that terrorism is the only thing that's left open to them, because it's the only avenue that they see to get the normal life that they want. So for all these reasons, the blockade of the gaza strip should be ended. Thank you.
The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce recall elections. A little bit of modeling: what we mean by this is that in the united states we would have a petition. Once it reaches the appropriate barrier of signatures and congress agrees that there ought be a recall election, then you would go and recast a vote for any elected position. We aren't limiting this to president or governors or anything like this so anyone, congress people, like local government, etcetera. Three main areas of clash: first, on why it prevents political abuses. Sometimes, awful people make it into office because a lot they manage to convince a lot of people in a short amount of time that they happen to not be awful. A really good example of this is donald trump. Even the majority of voters of his voters would currently agree that he is an awful choice for president and ought no longer occupy that position. However, because he managed to be approachable and looked like a good businessman or any number of other justifications that people used for him when they voted for him, he managed to get himself elected, and now there's nothing we can do except impeach him, which is a much more difficult process than getting enough signatures on a petition. We think that we should be able to have that should we have recall elections, we could prevent him from doing anything worse from now on. We could have booted him out of office back when he threatened north korea, and therefore we would have had some kind of check on this process, that if someone wears a false face through the entirety of the electoral process, just they can't just take it off once they are elected and expect everything to be okay. We also think it provides a clearer picture of what being in office look like. We think that especially in local governments, you have a lot of people who come in because they want to have some kind of perverse incentive, right? They like want they were they are being paid off by oil corporations, or they want to be more easily like networked with people who might be able to invest in their own company, things like this. And we think that when you show that there is accountability, they're less likely to do so. This brings us to our second area of clash, which is basically that it forces politicians to listen to the people, because our current system means that, in the end, all that matters is that moment before elections when they have to convince the populace to vote them into office in the first place. Our system makes approval ratings matter, because if politicians don't listen to constituents, on our side of the house, then they are going to have a recall election. And it forces them to not just have to spume like make sure that they make keep the people who are paying them happy, they actually have to keep the general populace that elected them in the first place happy, because these are the people who can sign the petition that gets them recalled. We think it's especially important for those who don't have reelections to worry about, because we think with a lot of congress people, they have to keep listening to their constituency consistently because they have infinite election cycles to win before them. But when we're talking about things like president or other elections where there's like a limited number of terms or you don't have to you don't have to you can't run again after your first term, we think that recall the threat of recall elections forces them to still listen to their constituency after they are past the point of no return, even when they aren't afraid of not getting reelected. We think that currently there doesn't exist a check during that time, and we need to have one. Our third area of clash is that it encourages political involvement. It's easy to feel helpless in today's political system when someone you didn't vote for is in office doing awful things that you cannot control. And in order to cope with those feelings, people tend to disconnect from politics and media to avoid that helplessness. But if there's hope for a recall, we think that people are much more likely to stay active. They're much more likely to want to keep up on political events, to be that person checking the president. They're much more likely to gather signatures or go and fact check things when they don't feel as helpless and they think that there's some point of recourse for them. For these reasons, proud to propose.
The motion for today's debate is that we should limit the right to self defense. We mean by this is that currently there's like this very nebulous line in which people can say that they felt threatened or had like a perception of a threat and get away with like claiming the right to self defense when they caused someone else harm. We think this needs to be stricter standard, it can't just be I felt threatened rather they have to demonstrate a real threat via like real violence occurring or some weapon being involved or some intent on the part of the individual that shows that there was a real threat rather than just a perceived threat. Two main areas of clash, first on adressing police brutality and other racial biases. There's a problem in the status quo where because of racial stereotyping and biases certain groups of people are automatically perceived to be more of a threat ie a white person in the same situation and occupying the same space as a black person is much much less likely to be seen as threatening or assumed to have had like some kind of violent or dangerous desires. For example a black child was shot like two years ago when holding a toy gun because the police thought like confused it for a real one and just shot at them. The problem here is that had this child been white the same kind of threshold for this is a threat would never have been reached because it would have been way more higher. We think this is really problematic because it's completely based on the color of a person's skin and the way that they are perceived in society and given that it is society that has created this perception of black youth being thugs and people of color being more likely to commit crimes eventhough this is not this is not true and in the situations where it is it is based again in societal like shoving them into poor areas and being awful. We think that this is like very problematic. People don't regulate themselves when they feel like the law will absolutely protect them. There's no incentive to check before you shoot or like put your hand finger in a different place so that you don't get trigger happy because you know that if you do you can just claim self defense and move on, so you don't you like choose to be risk averse for yourself. This is especially relevant with police because they hold so much power over individuals in society and have so much protection from the government that allows them to do disproportionate amount of harms and it's impossible to target them specifically without backlash so this kind of broad legislation would be especially helpful in like affecting both the common person but especially affecting police so that you have less like thin blue line protests where they're like oh you're especially shitting on police. Our second area of clash is about balancing the protection of individual rights. Just as there is a right to self defense, people also have a right to life. The problem occurs when the two start to encroach on each other such in a situation where someone feels like that right to life is threatened and so takes away someone else's life in the process. But I think that these kinds of things need to be imagined in terms of threshold like we think that at the point that one person feels threatened but it comes at the risk of the life of another person when the first person was never in any danger in the first place we probably value that person who just got shot life a lot more. So yeah this is a balancing act but recognize that there isn't an absolute right to self defense insofar as it gives a disproportionate amount of power to individuals over other people's rights. And if the the we need to prevent the misuse and so it needs to be limited and so there's like no other way for the government to control these kinds of things because there's no way for someone else to be present in every single situation where this is necessary to be viewed. This is similar to the freedom of speech. Slander and libel aren't protected because it encroaches on other people's rights eventhough technically they're just forms of speech that technically are like free if we believe in an absolute freedom of speech but we recognize that sometimes other people's rights outweigh those of those of some and so we think this is a very similar situation where like maybe this is where it like me having to check twice is very unlikely to affect me but could cause someone else their life. Proud to propose.
We should introduce year-round schooling. The summer break is an invention from the times of agriculture of the times of incredible farming obviously we are not done with agriculture but we are largely done with a population which makes the bulk of its money thorugh farming. Given that this model is incredibly outdated, that it harms the education of students, and the welfare of all individuals involved in schools, we would say that we should introduce year-round schooling. The model's fairly simple: the school year will become year-round, the school day will start a little bit later, they'll be additional total school but not by a massive margine. Three reasons why this is a good idea. First, terms of wakefulness and attention. We think that students come to school incredibly tired, incredibly unfocused, and take naps during classes instead of being able to learn. This is problematic as it destroys the true value of school which is education, particularly for students who already struggle. We think that students who are already struggling are more prone to losing focus or have more difficulty learning the material at home particularly when they're tired and students get an extra hour of sleep, they have better attention, and a better understanding of the material. This is incredibly important and will largely lead to long term welfare and benefits. My second argument is the value of a consistent education. We think that the school year is spent inefficiently. A huge portion of the school year is spent on reteaching things from the previous year that was forgotten over the incredibly long summer break. By removing summer break, we remove the time that was previously spent on reteaching material. As such, over the five years that students go through elementary school excluding kindergarten, we think that students will effectively get an extra year worth of education simply because you don't need to reteach all that previous material. This will put american students ahead, this will improve their quality of life, and improve the school system overall. Additionally, certain subjects will just be leaps and bounds better. Language requires constant practice and constant training. Taking three months off of a language effectively destroys one's ability to comprehend that language. Having everyday classes and things like language, math and gym, we will ensure that students have healthy habits and practices which will allow them to study into the long term and learn the subject in the best way possible. My third and final argument is about welfare programs in schools. Many students require things like school lunches, require a controlled area, require time to play every single day to actually stay alive. This is because these sort of things are not offered in their home. The summertime is the worst time possible. Kids run around on the streets, kids get into violence and crime simply because there's no one watching them, and many students go hungry simply because their parents are unable or unwilling to feed them. School guarantees that students have at least one warm meal a day and ensures that they do not get into trouble under the watchful eye of teachers and administrators. By making it year-round, we ensure that students do not suffer the harms that they would have for by going home for an extended period of time. This will save lives and prevent students from going into crime and being funneled into prison. For this reason, we should introduce year round schools.
We should introduce recall elections. So in some US states, for instance, if people living in that state think the governor is doing a poor job, they can hold a referendum, and everyone votes on whether or not they want to keep the governor or recall him and then elect a new governor. We think that pretty much every liberal democracy should introduce similar policies. We've seen this take place in US states, like wisconsin, in recent years. Two arguments. The first is about accountability for politicians. Right now, politicians talk a good talk during elections. They say that they're going to do things that the people actually care about. Then they get into office and suddenly they're able to start filling their pockets, and helping out their friends, and listening to big business interests, and basically ignore people until six months before the next election. There's no accountability for what you do except for the immediate period right before an election. Because people, generally speaking, have to think about more recent information rather than something you did two years ago. But what this means is that if we implemented recall elections, you could remove politicians as they did bad things. Ultimately, we think this has tremendous impacts for a few reasons. One, it changes the decision-making of politicians up front. It's now harder to go into politics simply to fill your own pockets or to make money for your friends, so we think that fewer bad people, basically, are going to be willing to go into politics. But secondly, we also think that it gives you more of an incentive to run on honest policies. Candidates will have less of an incentive to oversell themselves or to promise things that they can't deliver if they know that they might be removed for failing to fulfill campaign promises. And thirdly, we think it's much more likely that the politicians who run will actually reflect the will of the constituents, that you'll have support for things like social welfare or policies that ordinary people in their districts want. The other team might try to tell you that this means politicians will change constantly in order to try to react to the latest polling data, but I don't see why this is necessarily bad. We think politicians should react to what the people want, even outside of an election year. It doesn't make much sense to me that simply because you win an election in two thousand sixteen, you should have a mandate to do whatever you want until twenty twenty four. Circumstances in the world change. Why shouldn't your governments have to as well? We can hold people accountable, we can make them be honest, and we think that ultimately this leads to a healthier democracy. Which leads nicely into our second major argument about democratic engagement. Right now, if you live in a liberal country, there's really no reason to be engaged in politics between election years. Nobody really cares about protesters, so you don't have any way to change anything in government if you don't like the way things are going. You can write to your congressman and things like that, but they don't have any reason to listen to you because they know that ultimately, as long as they're a little better than the other guy during election year, that they don't have anything to worry about. But if you have the ability to have recall elections, then suddenly it makes sense for people to be engaged throughout their lives rather than only every few years when there's an election. If people are thinking about whether or not they want to recall a politician, then they need to inform themselves on the issues. So you create more of an incentive for people to be informed. But on top of that, you create an incentive for people to contact their elected officials, to think about who else could be governing them. And we think that this means that people will be more democratically engaged. A democracy really only works if people are voting, if people are thinking about the issues, that people care and feel like they have a voice. It's a big problem right now and a reason why there's such low voter turnout in the west, that people don't think they have a voice. They don't think their vote matters. We think that we shift that kind of decision-making on our side by encouraging people to participate in electoral politics and in democracy in between election years so that it matters much more to their ordinary day-to-day lives. So because of accountability and because of democratic engagement, we should introduce recall elections. Thank you.
We should legalize public nudity. So I think it's important to establish a couple of definitions. By public nudity we mean the ability for people to see the naked body in a public place. Straightforward enough. But we think it's important that this round is about non sexual nudity. We're okay with preventing lewd behavior, but we don't think that there's inherently sexual about naked bodies in and of themselves so we think that they ought be permitted in public. So, our first argument is about victimless crimes. So first of all I think it's important to establish nobody even the smallest child is unaware of nudity. Everyone sees their own body every day. On top of that though we tell you that there is no harm to seeing another person naked. I'd like to ask the other team to explain where this horror might arise. We don't see how seeing a familiar sight, something that your entirely aware of, something that occurs in nature, something that isn't especially obscene, except for perhaps according to certain religious groups that not everyone is a part of, something that effectively shouldn't be offensive to anybody. We think that just as in the status quo there's been a huge push to allow mothers to nurse in public because it's not sexual and it's not obscene and it's a normal part of life that everyone has participated in, we should allow nudity in the same way because, again. , there are no harms and it's a perfectly normal part of life. So the question then is why do we punish in the status quo? The status quo is fundamentally moralizing and we don't think this is the role of the state. Basically. Right now, in countries that don't allow public nudity, like some parts of the US or europe, certain people have decided that because they don't want to see naked people in public, no one should be able to be naked in public. Now this seems problematic because it makes a value judgment on behalf of everyone and that value judgment is that it's more important that some individuals can avoid the naked body than other people can choose to express themselves. We think that in the same way that clothing choice is incredibly diverse and not very regulated and that's a huge expression of one's own public opinions so is nudity. We don't see why you should limit someone's public expression, particularly when most countries protect freedom of expression but don't give people some sort of positive right not to see nudity. It just seems like the enforcement of arbitrary moral standards on everyone. Moral standards that are probably held by a minority in many countries at this point in time. So our second argument then is about fair standards. I think that it would be okay to legalize nudity if we could come up with general fair standards for when people were decent and not decent. But I think that the the very idea of decency is arbitrary and I think that in order to win the debate the other side needs to explain to you a fair standard for decency. So right now it's probably true that most countries have a majority view. Perhaps most people in a country like france think that it's okay to be nude at the beach but not okay to be nude at the supermarket. But we think that first of all that's arbitrary, why should the rules be different in one place where families go every day, like the beach, then another place where families go everyday, like the supermarket. Maybe it would be nice if everybody wore a collared shirt to work every day, and maybe a workplace can require that, but we don't see that you should require a collared shirt in the supermarket if you don't require one everywhere. This doesn't seem meaningfully different. Yes, nudity might be a bit shocking, but it's only because we're not used to it. It's not really that different than the distinction between a collared and collarless shirt. So you're effectively enforcing the views of a majority on a minority arbitrarily. And within society there's also likely to be a great deal of dissent about what is and isn't decent. For instance, muslim citizens of france might prefer to see women cover their heads at all times. We think that that's a perfectly legitimate individual choice but in the same way that some people might be offended by seeing or even though some people might be offended by a single woman with her head uncovered in the streets in a french city, some people are offended by seeing nudity in the streets of a french city. Most french people would argue against a more restrictive standard, such as forcing women to keep their heads covered, we in the same way favor a less restrictive standard by allowing people to choose to be nude if they want to do so. Ultimately we think that there's no clear line in the sand for when a standard of decency becomes fair, or becomes arbitrary, or when something becomes decent or indecent, so at that point we ought just defer to maximizing individual freedom by allowing public nudity. So for these reasons, because it doesn't hurt anybody and because there's no fair way to regulate against it, we should legalize public nudity. Thank you
Slum tourism creates more harm than good. So to be clear, when we're talking about slum tourism we're talking about mostly third world countries, various places like casbahs and such, in which the overwhelming poverty of the area is so shocking, that it is enough to bring people in from the outside just to view this form of poverty, and how different it is. So the first thing we need to do in order to compare the two, is talk a little bit about what's good about slum tourism. We recognize that slum tourism means more money in the economy, in the local economy. It means that a restaurant can open up that feeds the tourists, for example, or a taxi driver can start a taxi business, because tourists have the actual money to take taxis and go from place to place. We think however this is minimal. Meaning it helps a few people within these communities get some more money, but the community as a whole is not particularly helped by this. What then is the massive harm of slum tourism. We think the big harm of slum tourism is that it creates an economy that is based around poverty and suffering. Here's the crucial bit. Once an economy is created, it is substantially more difficult to destroy. We'll talk about that in a moment. But this means that you're essentially solidifying the situation of these people. You're ensuring that they maintain and remain as poor as they are today, because you have powerful people whose interest it is to keep that. What powerful people are these? A, on a national level. We think the biggest thing slump tourism does is not bring tourists into the city, but bring tourists into the country with the intention of, among other things, seeing these neighborhoods. So you don't go stay in these poor neighborhoods, but rather you stay in the five star hilton in the major city, and on one of the days on your trip you take a you take a a tour of the slum that's an hour drive outside of the city. We think this creates a massive incentive to maintain the slum tourism for on a national level, either for rich businessmen who make a lot of money on the tourism, or for the government themselves who make money on the tourism. This means you disincentivize those businesses for from, for example, opening factories in those poor areas in which they could get cheap labor, but they make more money off keeping them poor. The same is true for government officials, particularly in more corrupt economies, which tend to be the poorer countries, in which you create a situation where they are no longer incentivized to ensure that there is some form of growth in those neighborhoods, in the form of tax breaks for example, or government subsidies, but rather they are kept down, kept poor. This means you block any potential for investment in those areas, either governmental or business because it is in everyone's greater economic interest to keep those people poor. Secondly, on a local level. If it is true that some people are making some more money because of this tourism, then those people become the relatively powerful people within those communities, who make their money based on the suffering of the other people within these communities. That means that on a local level as well, there's an incentive for individuals to keep the surroundings poor. What this essentially means is that any benefits you get from trickle down effects in general when you create some form of growth in an economy, is likely to be stopped here, because a trickle down would harm the economic interests of those who have some economic power in these communities. Simplistically it seems obvious that putting some more money into these communities is good. But when you look at it in a grand scheme, it really means that you're keeping them poor for longer periods of time. Please oppose slum tourism and support the motion.
The motion for today's debate is that we should cancel the patriot act. We mean by this is that we would prefer it if lawmakers immediately took action against the patriot act and so, from now on, it would not exist as well as the rules that it has in place. Three main areas of clash: first, on why it is an unjust passing. Recognize that in if we show you that, in the first place, this patriot act should never have passed, it ought necessarily be repealed now. Recognize that in democracy, policy needs to be consensual, because democracy is based on consent of the government and if you don't have consent of the governed, then it necessarily means that you are oppressive and not operating in a way that is legitimate. And in order to have the consent of the governed, it's not enough just like exist as like a theoretically consensual western liberal democracy, rather that consent and that desire has to be reflected in the in like public policy. And like and this is true not just for like just general democratic reasons, but also because the political will of the people who are governed needs to be reflected insofar as they are most affected by it. Insofar as this is true, any policy passed without consent is illegal and oppressive. Consent requires two things. First, it requires alternatives. This is true because only with alternatives are we able to avoid coercion. If I'm told that my mother is going to die unless I do this one thing and if I do nothing, then she will pass, then necessarily I'm going to do that one thing because I don't see there being a viable alternative. This would be the truth even if what I'm going to do is something incredibly bad and problematic, like stealing something or going against my own moral claims. We think people would still often make that decision because the alternative is something much worse. This is coercive and nonconsensual, though, because in a world in which I had full freedom, I wouldn't do it. But second, we think that emotional stability is also incredibly important insofar as this is the the reason that we don't think consent is required when someone is really drunk, or even when someone is like not necessarily like like enthusiastically consenting, because in order to have consent, you have to establish rationality, because that's the only world in which you know that that person truly wants what is happening. But recognize that the patriot act was passed right after nine eleven. People were terrified. This means that they weren't emotionally stable. They were just trying to find a way to feel safe in a moment where they couldn't figure out how. But also, recognize that it also they were also told this was the only thing they could do in order to prevent terrorism. Thus, there were no alternatives in their mind, because the government necessarily posed it as if if we don't pass this act, terrorists will overrun our country, and the united states will cease to exist. This necessarily made this act coercive, which means it would never should never happened. We think we're fine with a world in which we like cancel the patriot act now and recreate all the votes, and if like all the people still want it, we would allow it to pass. But we still think that it needs to go through that kind of check before we can accept it. Our second area of clash is about how it's rights violative. First recognize that it allows the government to spy on its citizens, thus violating the right to privacy and other like consent frameworks we think are important. This is something that the government should never legislate in a way that they allow themselves to do it, and like necessarily ought not exist in a democratic society in which people should have their full and free rights in order to self-actualize and exist in a way that they feel safe. But also, recognize that it does an incredibly problematic thing as well in that it it lets the government obstruct obstruct the rights of the accused by hiding evidence. Because part of the patriot acts act says that if the government has evidence that they think like leads them to a terrorist organization, they don't have to show it in court, but that person can still be like indicted based on it. This constitutionally violates the right to a fair trial insofar as it creates an imbalance between the government and anyone who's trying to defend the convicted, because the government can just say, " but look, this is really compelling like evidence, we just can't show it to you, " on the grounds of national security. Insofar as this is unconstitutional and has bad pragmatic outcomes, proud to propose.
As much as the concept of creating a super national union for countries to promote the big goals and aims of trade and peace sounds appealing we must face reality and be able to admit when such an organization is failing and is no longer justifying the cost that's invested in it. This union has been unsuccessful during the decades of its operation to bring about a significant rise either in growth or prosperity of the member countries. There are several reasons for that: the first one is vast cultural differences. If we look at the european union as an example for a super national organization that is a relatively successful then we could say that despite the obvious differences in culture there is still a common line between the countries that are like members of of the union. They are all democratic countries with a capitalist economy, christianity is overwhelmingly the dominant religion in the union and so on. But when we look at the ASEAN we can clearly see that we are talking about a union between countries with a completely different nature. Democracies like the philippines alongside monarchies like thailand alongside like military regimes in myanmar, communist regimes in laos or autocratic regimes in singapore. There is not even one dominant religion. We have christianity, we have islam, we have buddhism. So in short we say that it is very difficult to create a true mutual ground, mutual language, this way and like to establish real cooperation. Second reason is very unstable economies. If there is anything that we've learned from looking at the difficulties that the european union is facing is that the effect of weak countries on the verge of collapsing like weak member states that are on the verge of collapse or that actually do collapse means trouble for the entire union and it takes huge investments of huge sums of money in attempts to save these member states from bankruptcy. And with all due respect for the hardship that the greek economy is facing we believe that there is no way to compare it to the economies of countries such as cambodia or thailand that are in much worse shape. So creating a trade zone between rich countries like singapore and poor countries like thailand or cambodia brings to a complete dependency of the poorer countries upon the richer countries. This dependency creates conflicts and much resentment even and it might have the opposite effect of what we actually want to achieve on trade on exporting and importing because the relations between the countries are getting tense and so this might have an an negative effect on trade and it might do more harm than good on that respect. And so it seems that not only the history of this organization teaches us that it's not particularly successful but we also have a few structural reasons to believe that no significant change is seen in the near future. Maintaining such an organization costs huge sums of money we have to like occupy buildings and pay salaries and conduct summits in signed treaties this is a lot of investment that goes out without achieving anything. It is a shame basically and so we support the disbanding of the ASEAN
We should legalize polygamy. So, just so everyone's clear what we're talking about in this debate. We think that in countries where polygamy is currently illegal, such as the united states, britain, canada, that these countries should stop prosecuting people for polygamy, should add it to the books as something legal if they need to do so because of a civil code, or get rid of a law that prevents it if they have common law, all that. But on top of that, by polygamy we mean the practice of someone taking more than one spouse. We're okay with this being one husband with many wives, one wife with many husbands, or if that district would otherwise allow it, you could also have same sex polygamists marriages, we're fine with that if it would otherwise be legal in that country. So yes in the united states, no in germany, for instance. So, with that in mind, we have three arguments today. The first is that banning polygamy is tantamount to religious discrimination. Recognize that the reason why polygamy has been banned in countries like the united states or britain is because there's a strong norm against polygamy in certain christian denominations. We see that the catholic church, for instance, has preached against polygamy for hundreds and hundreds of years, and that catholic countries overwhelmingly, perhaps all of them, ban polygamy. We think that first of all, it's unfair for countries to make law based on religious norms. We think that individuals should be free to choose to follow or not to follow these religious laws. First of all, if people don't have a real choice about following a religious custom, then they're probably not actually doing anything to fulfill their spiritual obligations, but on top of that we think that, for instance, if you are a muslim living in a predominantly catholic country, you should still be able to practice polygamy because that's acceptable within the confines of your own faith. A good example of this is why polygamy was banned in the united states. Some of you may know that mormonism is a religion which originated in america and which encouraged, until very recently, its followers to practice polygamy. So the united states banned polygamy, and used it as a way to prosecute mormons as a religious minority throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Mormon leaders eventually changed their rules in order to end persecution by the american government. But we think that this is completely unjust, and that if people wish to practice polygamy due to a certain religious obligation, that they should be free to do so, in the same way that people are free to practice anything else religious that doesn't harm others. Our second argument is that polygamy is a victimless crime. In general, we think that government should only intervene in people's personal freedom to limit it, when there are actually going to be third party harms. We think that, for instance, it's okay to ban smoking because secondhand smoke puts other people at risk of lung cancer. It's okay to ban theft because you don't have a right to take other people's things. But we don't see any real harm to polygamy. Why is this true? So in order for people to get married they have to enter into a contract, which means that they can't be coerced because presumably they're going to have to go before a judge and say that they weren't coerced, in order to get this marriage contract. Rules like the minimum age for getting married are still going to exist, so we're not worried about young women being pressured by older men into polygamous marriages, like some people might say would happen. We think that everyone will have to follow all other existing laws. So at that point, there's no real harm because people are consenting into this, and it ought be permitted to maximize personal freedom. Our third argument is that bans on polygamy are unenforceable. Why is this true? So in a country like the US, where it has strict laws against polygamy and has had them for over a hundred years, we see that there's still no way to stop people from living in a polygamous fashion. Lots of people never go down to city hall to get a marriage certificate or whatever you may do in other countries, they just choose to live as husband and wife, treat each other like such. We see that marriage is predominantly a social and religious phenomenon, and not a government one. At that point, you can't stop people from having polygamous marriages in a religious or social setting, so there's ultimately no reason to ban it from a legal perspective, because you can't prevent the actions in themselves, only the state recognition of those actions. So at the end of the day, we think we should legalize polygamy in order to end religious discrimination, because it's a victimless crime, and because the law is unenforceable. Thank you.
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offense. So I wanna be clear what we're talking about. Assisted suicide is when a doctor or a medical professional facilitates someone ending their own life. So normally this is going to be someone with a terminal illness and the doctor is going to get them some medication or something that will end their life and give it to them and facilitate their ability to use this if they're having difficulty doing so because they're so close to the end of their life. We think that there should be a criminal offense for the medical professional, not for the person seeking to end their own life. Three arguments, the first, is that this is a clear breach of medical ethics. Doctors in particular are sworn under the hippocratic oath in most countries to do what they can to protect and preserve life and to help people to recover from illness. Obviously there is a breach of this oath when they are facilitating suicide. We tell you that doctors are encouraging someone to do something that is actively damaging to their health. It doesn't matter if this is what the person wants. I wanna be very clear about that. Society all the time forces people to get medical treatment that they don't want. We institutionalize people, we put them in rehabilitation programs. It's clear that people's medical care is provided by society whether they want it or not. We think that one reason why this is the case is because people who are ill or addicts or otherwise in a difficult position, aren't capable of making the best decision for themself. You need someone who is unbiased and not in that type of position to make a decision for them and it should be a doctor, and that doctors should try to administer the kind of help that they need rather than give them this kind of very ultimately damaging procedure. Our second argument is about perverse incentives. I think it's unfortunate but money is always a part of healthcare decisions. In countries like the united states, people are denied care because they're unable to pay. In countries like britain and canada, services that are available to the very rich aren't available to lower income people because the government health care service can't afford to pay for them. As an example of this people often wait months at a time for MRI's in europe or in canada which would be available same day in the united states at a much higher price. So if there's already a perverse incentive for insurance companies to encourage doctors not to offer certain treatments because they're expensive, then I think that there's a horrible perverse incentive to offering to legalize doctors killing a patients. As an insurance company, why would you ever want to pay out to help someone in terminal care? This is a person who will never pay premiums again, who will never repay medical debts, and who is costing you a lot of money because end of life care is actually the most expensive type of care in the medical system in the US and I presume other countries as well right now. So insurance companies now have a huge perverse incentive to not give doctors any alternative other than a physician assisted suicide. In other words, they will cover physician assisted suicide and no other alternative so that doctors will be forced into this and patients will have their hands forced and we think that is unacceptable, but insurance companies are such a coercive entity that they'll be able to do this and also to lobby and get away with it at a governmental level. Our last argument is that nobody can make an intelligent decision about death other than to remain alive. Why is this true? No one knows what death is like. I remember at the end of plato's apology when socrates says if death is but a dreamless slumber then I won't be so sorry to have died at all and if death means going down to hades and speaking with the ancients that it won't be such a terrible thing. But to this day nobody actually knows what happens when you die. It might be the case that the christians are right and suicide means that you go to hell. It might be the case that nothing happens at all, but the point is that in the face of a total lack of information, you shouldn't make a very drastic irreversible decision. Suicide is a permanent solution to what may turn out to be a temporary problem and we don't think it should ever be an option for that reason. Therefore assisted suicide should be a criminal offense for the doctor. Thank you.
We should ban school uniforms. School uniforms serve essentially no purpose outside of what regular regulation on clothes would actually do. We think that you can prevent things like gang signs on clothes, scantily clad clothes, using basic regulation, but forcing uniformity through a uniform is far more likely to impede the ability for students to freely engage with one another and to essentially express themselves in the best way possible. To that end, we would support the following model: that in the united states, no school be allowed to force all children to wear the same outfit, even if it's with just within their gender. We are not going to say that schools cannot regulate exactly what children wear when they're actually saying what's not allowed. We think that stopping people from just wearing their underwear or wearing slurs on their shirt is probably good policy, but if they want to express this sort of uniformity, that would be banned. My first argument is that students have a first amendment right that should be protected. Although the courts have ruled a few times that students do not have first amendment rights in schools, we think, first, that this is a problematic decision, and second, it should not extend to the clothes that students wear when it is not destructive. So, first on just the morality. We think that this sort of policy is largely informed by archaic and largely unknown nuanced perceptions of how students engage. We think that, in the modern day, as technology becomes more prevalent, as discourses regarding rights abuses become more common at a younger age, students are far more effective at being able to understand and express their rights. As such, they are also able to engage politically far more easily. Any individual who has voted in the last decade was affected at least somewhat by the news they read online and the comments that people put on them. As such, we think that even young students, those in early high school, may have had some effect on the politics of either their classmates or of the people around them. Restricting their ability to freely speak by restricting their ability to wear particular clothes is a, then, a violation of their first amendment rights. It prevents them, first, from self-actualizing, as they cannot be happy with what they're wearing, but secondly, it restricts their political speech as well. We think that the only time that restricting political speech is justified is when that political speech disrupts the school itself, but we think that other regulations can cover this. Now my second argument is that this puts unfair standards on students. Where do we see this? First is with women in schools. We think that these sort of policies usually force women to wear more clothes and have their clothes at a higher standard. We think that, in the winter, it largely means that they still have to wear these sort of dresses, these tights, and as such, they're far more likely to be cold. They're far more likely to be scrutinized and chastised based on the outfits they wear. Conversely, we also think it harms men as well as, during the summer, men are still forced to wear khakis, can't change into shorts and as such, are uncomfortable. We think that the comfort of students is worth far more than the egos of administrators who attempt to force a uniform on students of the school that they're controlling. Secondly, though, we think that this is a bad policy for kids in poverty. Why is this the case? First, damaged clothes are harder to replace. When I was a kid, if I were to ruin my pants, I could go to a goodwill or another thrift shop and buy new pants incredibly cheaply. Were there a uniform and I had to buy it through the same sort of organization every time, my parents would be incredibly hard-pressed to actually fulfill this sort of obligation. We think that's unfair to put particular harms on students, even if it's not written into the policy itself. If the effect is classist, it should not be enforced. Additionally, we think that things like dirty clothes, we think that inabilities to essentially get to the laundromat at a particular time, are far more likely to be punished for students in poverty, pushing them into worse classes, pushing them through more disciplinary action, and largely harming their efforts in the rest of their life. For this reason, we should ban school uniforms.
The motion for today's debate is that we should prohibit slum tourism, slum tourism being the act by which tours of usually wealthy people go into like slummy or less like more underprivileged, less wealthy neighborhoods to look at the way that the poor live and like take pictures, etcetera. So, two main areas of clash, the first on why we think it is problematic that it benefits from the suffering of others and not only benefits, but actively often harms the people while benefiting. We think it's important to set a framework by which you understand who exactly is benefiting from these kinds of tours, because we think it's never the case that this money somehow goes down to the people living in these areas, that somehow it actively helps people that there are tour buses moving through their cities. The truth of the matter is that a lot of the time these tours are run by large corporations that pocket the money coming out of the tours, and never give anything back to the community. At most, you get a couple of dollars trickling out per tour back into these slums but in the majority of situations, they get nothing, rather you're just helping these large corporate corporate tours grow and profit. We think the benefits also go to the rich people who get to wander around these locations. They get to look around, feel like bit feel like they're getting a different view of the world, without having to actively spend very much or give back to these communities or become a part of these communities and truly understand their suffering. They get to be passing by and looking through the window. We think the problem is that the people who are who are the who are at the core of this, the people who are getting looked at, the people who live in these neighborhoods, get nothing out of it. Not only does the money not go to them, but it's also that they get actively harmed. They're they are looked at by by people who are richer as though they are exotic. It is degrading to their to them to be like animals in a zoo for the pleasure of those who are richer. We think these tours exoticisize poverty and degrade the people in these areas, and that is unacceptable and ought be prohibited. Our second area of clash has to do with gentrification. We think that a lot of the time these kinds of tours draw attention to low income areas and draw rich people into them in a way that gentrifies and ultimately pushes out those of lower income. We think exoticisizing the area attracts younger people for who, for two reasons, decide to settle nearby: either they think that they can help the area to grow and flourish and reach their conception of what a good area or a healthy neighborhood would look like, or they think it's cool to live around slums. They're hipsters who want to feel like they are up and coming in this area. We think the problem is that even the most well-intentioned of people who are moving into these area push the costs of living up. They compete with with those who are already in the area for housing costs and because they can afford afford a higher cost, they often push the prices of houses up for everyone else. They want their groceries to come of a higher standard and thus have a higher price, so what once was a stop and shop becomes a whole foods, and they push local businesses out because once local businesses can because once bigger businesses can see that they can make a profit in this area where they previously could not, they buy out the leases of those that are preexisting. Slowly the area becomes gentrified and those people are pushed out. The problem with pushing those who are poorer out is that there's not really a place for them to go. We think this is another example of destroying an established community without ever giving back to them and benefiting off of their suffering. We think it's a problem that what happens on their side of the house is the romanticization of poverty, the destruction of people's communities, and then the subsequent continual ignoring of there actually being a problem. We think it is preferable then to just leave these communities alone. Never touch them in the first place because at least then, you're not actively destroying what they're built. For these, reasons proud to propose.
One crucial thing to keep in mind throughout this debate. Oppositions are going to tell you that the harms from beauty pageants aren't so greater, that they're not unique to beauty pageants. Just remember while they're telling you this, that the benefit you get from beauty pageants is nonexistent. The benefit is the entertainment of men sitting at home, enjoying seeing women paraded in front of them. That's not a big enough benefit to excuse almost anything, and we think the harms of beauty pageants are massive. Two such harms: one, the perpetuation of negative north, and two, on the self esteem in impressionable young women. Let's start talking about perpetuation of negative norms. Three such norms: one, objectification. At the point at which women are paraded across the state dressed up differently, performing different acts, always less-clothed, always just for their beauty, judged by a panel of women and men giving them literal number values based on how they look, you're pushing women ever more into the box of an object, of something that's to be appreciated for what it looks like, as opposed to what it who it is or what they say or how they think. Secondly, you perpetuate rape culture. Not because women are scantily clad, we think that's fine, but because of the way you objectify women, you perpetuate the notion that they exist for the appreciation and enjoyment of men. Once you perpetuate that notion, you perpetuate the idea that it is within a man's rights to take what is his, that he can use a woman for his enjoyment, because that's what they're doing up on stage in front of everyone. Lastly, it perpetuatea gender norms. It's not just that they're scantily clad, it's not just that they're parading around, but they always get voted on their ideals and supposedly what they perform in their acts and their speeches. And you'd note that consistently over years, the winners are people who talk about things like happiness and joyfulness and world peace, and perform things like art and happy thinking. You've never seen a woman go up there and perform a chemist experiment, because that's just not ladylike. So we say it perpetuates gender norms. Crucially, we're not saying that women up there didn't choose to be up there. We're saying that them being up there is harmful to women all over the world, and doing this harm to other people should be discontinued. Secondly, let's talk about self esteem in impressionable young women. Two things we say we think this does. One, it ties self esteem to beauty. How does it do that? Using childhood tropes of value. Things like the word queen thrown around in beauty queen or princess, things like a crown given to the winner and a sash given to everyone who participates. The ball that these people enter into, all of this terminology, all of these tropes, throw women back to the stories they were told us children and to the equations they create of what is valuable in this world. Using that, they portray value as external good looks. A second thing that they do is they set an unachievably high bar to this value, so they tell women you are to be valued based on how you look, they do this literally by value in women based on how their looks that they look in, setting it to tropes of what should be important to women all around the world. And then they make that goal way too high to achieve, way too difficult. What does all this do? It sets in depression, it sets in eating disorder, it sets in unhappiness. All of this for what? So that a few people can enjoy watching a few pretty girls scamper around on stage. We don't think it's worth it. Please cancel beauty pageants.
The motion for today's debate is that we should increase immigration to the united states. We're going to go all out here and say the way we're gonna implement this is through something like open borders. Two main areas of clash: the first, on the obligation of the united states as a western liberal democracy and specifically as the united states. First and foremost we think there's an obligation to recognize freedom of movement is a fundamental human right. Before I get into what makes it a fundamental human right, I think it's important to establish the human rights exist outside of the states states and those laws that you're under. Weeding that rather this comes from something that is innately human about us as individuals. We see this in situations such as, even if like, in a different country such as, like even if germany decided to fundamentally a bridge things like property rights, even when we see something like in syria - where there are human rights abuses with regards to like shooting your own citizens, even though these are different countries that operate under different law systems, we still denounce these practices because we don't respect sovereignty above our respect for fundamental human rights. Now that we've established that, let's talk about why movement specifically is a human right. We think that insofar as movement is facilitative to me filling out any other of my rights, AKA I cannot fulfill the right to life, the right to the pursuit of happiness, anything else that we recognize as fundamental, unless I can move to the places that allow me to do so or move enough to I don't know, if there's a job somewhere that will like let me self actualize better than what I'm currently doing. Unless I can move there I have no way of fulfilling them. Insofar as that's all like, that is the only way I can access my other rights, we think it has to be considered a human right. But more than that, we think that birth place itself especially arbitrary. Insofar as I didn't choose whether to be born in mexico or the united states, whether to be born to a drug addict or to a doctor, we think that it is fundamental to being a human that you ought to be able to change your situation in any way possible. And that if the states abridge this right they are bridging your ability to find equality regardless of where you are born. We think that the foundation of what the united states is built on even more so makes it a requirement for the US to recognize this. Insofar as the US is a country of immigrants, a country that gloats upon the idea of being built by people who escaped from their own countries, we think that because of this, the US specifically ought recognize this. We think that when we don't see it as a human rights violation, it, when we don't see this as like a fundamental human right we force people to stay in unpleasant situations, thus committing human rights violation ourselves. Our secondary of clash has to do with the pragmatics. First, let's talk about innovation. Because we think that when we allow youth and other people to come in from other countries, in a state where our population is aging dramatically dramatically faster than we are having children, we are increasing the amount of power and minds that are coming in and working in industries and contributing to the innovation of the nation. We think that this increases collaboration between groups that think incredibly differently. The way that I was taught to approach problems and view my life and my career here in the united states, is very different from the way that we approach society and careers in other countries such as russia or china. We think that because this allows better communication between these different groups, it is necessarily good to increase immigration. We also think that brilliant cultures come in from other countries. Things that we've never experienced before contribute to things like food, festivals and other beautiful things. Finally, on economics we think that low skilled labor increases competition and cheapens goods. Currently, the problem in the united states is that corporations are either outsourcing to other countries or making their goods incredibly expensive, because they have to either pay a lot for they have to pay a lot for labor. We think that when you bring in low skilled labor, the competition for who will who will accept the lowest wage increases and requires necessarily that goods prices go down. We think in the end a lot of the time immigrants to the job that american citizens just don't want, and fulfilling these jobs is good for the economy. For these reasons proud to propose.
The motion for today's debate is that we should fight global warming. We think the most important thing, to recognize in this round, is that long term safety is always more important, than short term economic gains. This is true for two reasons, first we tell you that it doesn't matter how much money you have, if you are choking and are dead by the time that you are able to use it. But second, that in the end money is temporary, but lives are permanent, and ending those lives is more so permanent. We care more about the fact that people can be dying in the future, than we do about a couple million more dollars, in the pockets of those who are already millionaires. Not only are they not going to be damaged by short term loss, but the people who are going to be damaged will be damaged much more harshly. With that, two many areas of clash. The first, on why we think that global warming is a short term, and long term threat, to the human race. In the immediate future, we think that we already see signs of global warming, that can cause massive destruction to human infrastructure and livelihood, especially in the ways that we see rising waters sweeping out entire towns, and like groupings of people's homes. Not only does this immediately remove these people's homes, and cause things like drownings, but more than this, we think that once these things are under water, there that besides these things being underwater, global warming also leads to the increasing of disease. Things like west nile virus are seen moving farther and farther north, as the temperature changes to be more acceptable for them. This destroys both individuals with diseases, that they were never acclimated to, and never would have expected, but also destroys the crops that feed them. With large sweeping destruction of crops comes more human starvation, and more human suffering. We think, even if you don't buy that we care about long term human lives, we think you do care about the way in which people die, and the way in which they suffer. Because, the short order pleasure the second order pleasure that I get from spending that extra money is incomparable, to the fact that other people around me are suffering from a much higher order pain. We think, at the point that they are actively being in pain and harmed, that's all that matters in this round. We also think, that long term scientists have already explained why global warming will cause massive death in large numbers to the human race. That overheating will essentially cause the heat of the earth, and and make it so that it is inhabitable to future generations. We think, at the point that this impacts the the like the entirety of the future of mankind, this is the most important thing in the round. Our second main area of clash has to do with the economics of global warming. Because we think that the op will come up, and say a lot about why it's so economically detrimental to fight global warming, but we think it' the opposite is actually true. We think that, as you lose land mass, it becomes more expensive to rebuild houses, and more expensive to rebuild that farmland elsewhere. Not to mention, that you're losing oftentimes millions dollars worth of crop land and crops. We think that when diseases spread to places they haven't been before, not only do they harm humans, but they also harm the crops, and the livestock, that create economic impetus in that area. Once you do that, you destroy the market for those things, and it damages trade relations. We think, generally, these are things that are bad for the economy, and we prefer for these regional and local economics to be better, rather than, on the like higher end of the pyramid, for a couple more millionaires to donate a couple more million dollars into the market, that operates outside of the sphere of the common man anyway. More than this, we think that global warming, and the fight for global warming, drives innovation, in a way that we currently just don't. Coming up with new green technologies, and being able to market those things, are all very good for good for the economy, and good for trade relations, within like a more global sphere. We think, at the point that you're actually going to be taking the market out of stagnation on our side of the house, economics is also on the side of fighting global warming. For these reasons, proud to propose.
We should ban fast food. What we're talking about specifically in this debate is we're gonna focus primarily on fast food chain restaurants, things like mcdonalds, subway burger king, anything that's a chain restaurant that primarily deals in giving food either through delivery, take away or through very quickly giving food, these types of restaurants. We're going to talk about banning those fast food restaurants and why we think those are negative to the overall health of society. So, we wanna start by just pointing out the obvious. That fast food chains are in general, terribly unhealthy. Even the healthy options in restaurants like mcdonald's, burger king and subway, so as their salads that come with high amounts of sugar, really terrible dressings for you, fried chicken, and other types of things that overall, don't make the healthy options on these menus any less detrimental to your health than getting a burger, or a bacon cheeseburger, anything awful that you could get at one of these restaurants. These things are high in fats, sugars, cholesterol, calories, and are largely consumed by children and families, which we think, only makes the impacts, the negative health impacts of these things all the worse when they're being consumed by people that are most vulnerable and are in most need of a healthy and balanced nutritional diet. So why do we think that we should ban fast foods? We think that people in the status quo, because of fast food, choose to opt for the quicker option rather than the time it takes to prepare food. On average the time it is taken to prepare food in the american household has gone down dramatically over the past two or three decades, and we think that the best way to combat that is to take away this option and to force people to try and make healthier decisions. People argue that banning fast food leads to harm such as people having to pay overall more money for food, but recognize that, healthy alternatives and healthy options and supermarkets exist and that, these options, the ability to buy a loaf of bread, the ability to buy a bag of apples, things like this, are not dramatically more expensive than going to a fast food restaurant where you already need to pay taxes, and you're already being forced to spend upwards of five or ten dollars. We think with comparable cost you can still be able to feed yourself when you're going to these restaurants uhh when you go to a supermarket, and when people compare speed we think that most meals are not necessarily needed to be eaten in five minutes, that they don't need to be at this speed, but if they do, you can again prepare these things yourself in a healthier manner. The comparison is you can make a sandwich in five minutes in your house, or you can go to mcdonald's and buy a cheeseburger. We think that the sandwich you make at your health, your house, is probably going to be on balance the same cost and the same amount of time it's going to take you, but it's going to have way fewer health hazards to you in the long run. We think that this forces people to get healthier both we both, at their homes but also away from their homes. So if people still choose to go out to eat when you remove fast food as an option, we think you go to restaurants in which the food is better handled, the nutritional standards are higher, and you're more likely to get a more balanced meal or even if not a more balanced meal, a meal in which the storage preparation in handling the food is of a higher quality to ensure that things like illnesses and disease aren't transferred by the foods that the masses are eating. We think that this is crucial given the obesity epidemic that exists in our world today. Childhood obesity rates are the highest they've ever been and are only going up, same with adult obesity rates. We think that fast food and the culture surrounding fast food, is a major reason for this issue, and we think that when you eliminate fast food as an option, it forces these trend lines to change. It forces people to make better and healthier decisions, not just because they, not because they want to, because as we see in the past and as we've seen through these rising trend lines, people don't want to make this change,. We think it's up to the government and it's necessary for the government in consideration with its people's health and its people's needs to change what they're able to eat, to make this change on what people are able to serve and to better educate people along with making a change that doesn't allow them to get the least healthy options available. Given that fast food restaurants present no healthy options and no way for people to make reasonable choices about their body, represent a hugely difficult trade off when you compare price cost in time in an ever quickening world, you need to force people to make this change themselves, and that's why we would ban fast food.
Immigration to the united states of america brings more good than harm. So, in this debate, I think it's critical that we acknowledge that a huge part of immigration to the united states happens, illegally, that lots of people come in with fake papers or they come in from latin america illegally. We still think though that on balance, immigration is ultimately a good thing. So, we have two major arguments: the first is that we think immigration drives growth in the united states. Recognize that the US is able to attract trained workers from around the world at no cost. So, basically, it takes a lot of resources and money to produce doctors and engineers and all of these other really highly skilled professionals, but those are a lot of the people who want to come to america. So, the united states is getting really good people from countries like china and india who already have college degrees that we didn't have to pay for. We're basically getting these really good, well-trained workers for free as a result of immigration and we think that that's an obvious benefit, that we're basically getting brain gain when other countries get brain drain. We think that this gives the US a competitive advantage relative to other countries and ultimately, is a really driving factor in american success. But also recognize the type of people who are willing to leave their family, leave their home and move to a new country are probably some of the most ambitious, entrepreneurial people in the world. We think that if you're lazy or if you're not hard working, you'll never even make it to this country because it's so difficult to go through the process of immigration. And this is true for illegal as well as legal immigration. Even if a lot of illegal immigrants, you know, they're not doctors or engineers, they're still hard-working people who were willing to take a big risk in order to get a better life for themselves and their families. So, we think that that type of person is more likely to start a business, more likely to work three jobs, more likely to do overtime, more likely to take risks once they get here, and that ultimately, that's a really important part of the economy is that people are willing to start a business, people are willing to put in the extra hour. That's ultimately what has made america so successful in the past relative to other countries. This is also as another major benefit, the only source of population growth for the US. So, recognize a lot of highly developed countries like, say, germany, have a shrinking population or a population that's stagnant. Basically, no one is having kids really, so you have more elderly people and fewer and fewer young people and when this happens, you run into a problem where in the future, there's not going to be enough workers to keep all your businesses going. Now, the united states is the only highly developed country that's really avoided this problem and it's entirely because of immigration. Americans, by and large, are having enough children to keep the population about flat. So, there would be zero growth and then you would probably see a trend towards a decline in population like you have in germany. But because the US attracts so many immigrants, you actually have population growth and we're able to avoid this problem so, at the end of the day, I think it's clear that immigration fuels the economy and that even undocumented workers, even so called illegal immigrants, are still people who are entrepreneurial and ambitious and that these people are a net benefit to the american economy. So, our second point is about the cultural benefits: we think that one of the major strengths of the US relative to other countries is it's tremendous diversity. There's more languages spoken in new york city than any other handful of square miles in the world, for instance. We think that as a result of this, the US can tap on the resources of lots of different regions around the world. There's a great sense of cosmopolitanism. We think that this leads to more cultural tolerance. Americans are more likely to be accepting of different cultures and different backgrounds if they're actually exposed to them and we think that you see this out within the united states that people in places like new york city and los angeles, who meet immigrants from around the world every day are probably more tolerant than people who never meet those individuals, so we think that ultimately, this promotes tolerance within the US. But it also promotes an ability to understand other people's cultures. US intelligence, the US military, etcetera, are able to recruit americans who have a deep understanding of other countries' and regions' cultures because their parents came here from those countries. So, when we did things like we went into afghanistan and iraq, those may have been poor decisions from a policy perspective, but very least, we had americans who spoke arabic and who spoke farsi and these other languages and we were able to be more successful because of that. So, we think that ultimately, diversity makes the united states culturally more accepting and also provides a lot of material benefits. So, for these reasons, we think that immigration to the USA brings more good than harm.
Casinos bring more harm than good for two big reasons: first, because casinos are just a way to trick people into spending more and more of their money on something that is never going to actually help them, really, and secondarily because casinos bring in a lot of associated crime, a lot of associated problems directly. So let's start by talking about casinos themselves because I think that it's important to note that casinos are not just the same thing as gambling. I think casinos are uniquely, as an institution, bad because they are designed in such a way to make money to make money off people and in order for them to make money off of people they necessarily have to bring in more money than they give out. So when people are gambling their money it's not just something like it's like a fifty fifty chance, or it's not something like an investment where you are likely going to be able to get something about or you're actually making like a skilled assessment. It's, essentially your wagering your money for, like, something that's very very unlikely actually going to give you any kind of pay out. But in addition to the fact that the odds are almost certainly going to be against you, there's also an incentive to keep waving that pile of money in front of you at these institutions. Keep drawing you in to play one more time. To like give it one more go, if the hope that maybe that time, that will be the time that you win. But it does not work out like that. That's not the way in which you actually persuade. That is not the way in which you actually like make money and I think that that's inherently bad. So the next thing that I want to talk about is associated crime because casinos directly bring in people like, you can look at places like las vegas as an example of this, casinos directly first bring in crime via drinking, because it's like public drinking or wide spread getting drunk because, well, as often times I think it's associated with gambling. So all of the crime that is associated with drunkenness, be it DUI's or violence, violent behavior sometimes, things like that. All of those harms as are associated with drunkenness are also associated with casinos as well. But I think in addition to that casinos also kind of fostering a general norm of not to say sin, but like a general norm of like things that people do that are less than savory. So when people tend to go to a place like las vegas, for example, you go there for the gambling but there's also oftentimes widespread like prostitution rings there and things like that, there's oftentimes like widespread drugs and things like that as well. So, there is an association of like a lot of crime with casinos as well besides the actual crime themselves. So finally, I think that it's important to compare all of these harms to the benefits of casinos because casinos aren't really something that's actually necessary for anything like that. They're just like a way in which people can be entertained. But, casinos as an institution aren't the way in which people have to gamble. Maybe you can gamble with like online poker or or do something with your friends instead. Like I think the casinos are just a uniquely bad manifestation of some of the worst impulses of people and the worst abuses of people. So for all those reasons, very proud to propose this motion.
The motion for today's debate is that we should fight nationalism. What we mean by this is that we shouldn't be promoting nationalistic ideologies, we should be discouraging people from expressing nationalistic views just in general like we would prefer a world in which we didn't really have nationalism as it currently is. Two main areas of clash. The first on domestic harms, and I really want to talk about the way that it changes the way that we treat immigrants and especially how it makes it much worse because when you when your identity is wrapped up in the us versus them mentality it is incredibly unlikely that you're going to treat those who you perceive as them very well at all. In fact, because because you are so defined by this concept of being one nationality and having to prove that you are better than another and oftentimes using stereotypes and other negative mechanisms to make sure that you are seen as better than the other, you actually end up in a situation where it is guaranteed that you're going to be treating citizens immigrants worse if you are nationalist. I think a really good example of this exist in the status quo when we see the way the US is treating immigrants coming in either from middle eastern countries or from across the border from mexico. Because we have such strong patriotic american feelings and we're willing to use rhetoric like stealing our jobs because we have such a possessive kind of way of viewing our country and viewing this land we refuse to cooperate or welcome those who happen to be less fortunate and happened to be born into a different categorization of country. And so we actually think that this is like already we're seeing the negative impacts of being a nationalist nation as the united states. We also think that you're much more likely to ascribe these negative stereotypes and see them as invaders if you are more nationalist because necessarily you are identifying people primarily by the nationality and by what country they're coming from and only secondarily maybe you're considering who they are as people or what their priorities are or whether they are starving or suffering and so because of that we actually think that you poison the way that people begin to think about immigrants from the get go. We also think it's important to notice that domestically it's incredibly difficult to criticize the government if you have a strong nationalist party or a strong nationalist following because basically what that does is when you're the one person saying bad things about the government and everybody else feels very positively then you're seen as an anti-nationalist to do so and it there's much more likely to be backlash or criticism against you. We also think that you're just less likely to think critically about the government if the environment in which you are raised is one that perpetuates that the nation is great recognize the nationals unnecessarily has to perpetuate the narrative that the nation that you're currently living in is doing well and is successful and is better than others which means that you're actually much less likely to be raised in an environment where you're thought to think critically in the first place. Our second independent point is about international harm. Recognize that inherent to the definition of nationalism is thinking that you are better than other countries. It creates a superiority complex which makes it much more likely that you're going to declaim others and their ideology and that you're less likely to actually want to cooperate or work with other people. We think this necessarily leads to more militaristic states because if the people who are within those states are more willing to take military action on behalf of the government and more likely to create black and white broad sweeping generalizations about whether a specific ideal ideology that is not of the country they come from is good or bad. We think a really good example of this is when the united states would invade vietnam or any other countries that we invaded during our little anti-communism trope that we played for a bit and at this time what we saw is because of our strong nationalism, out positive feelings towards capitalism etcetera we were willing to actively take other people's lives and oppress them and throw agent orange on top of their heads in order to prove a point essentially. We also think that nationalism hinders globalization. There's necessarily an unwillingness to compromise when you feel like you are objectively correct. It makes it really hard to run the global economy fairly because it makes it hard it makes hard lines between nations that stop nations from caring about each other and caring about citizens that aren't necessarily their own. So we think that without nationalism it's just much more likely that the united states or another country would look out for the citizens of a different country. For these reasons, proud to propose.
The motion for today's debate is that we should end the use of economic sanctions. We think this is a normative debate ie we prefer a world in which governments did not use economic sanctions against each other. Three main areas of clash, first on why they're ineffective. Recognize that the goal of economic sanctions is to force a country to cease a bad behavior and it's used most against dictatorial and other non-democratic regimes that are being oppressive because there's really no incentive to like harm yourself economically unless this is like an extreme case. The problem with these kind of with like the way that we use them is that these kind of regimes are the most likely to have built and maintained their power in part by using antiwestern sentiment and by talking about how they're going to keep themselves like kowtowing to the west etcetera and because of the rhetoric that they often use they can't be seen as capitulating to western demands because it hurts their image and hurts their support so like ie a lot of like big dictators are upheld by a few large families that are really really rich but those large families are also often built on patriotism and keep their money by maintaining an isolationist perspective that says that the west is awful so if the dictator was to say no I mean to capitulate to these economic sanctions they risk losing a whole lot more money and a whole lot of political support from their biggest donors. The other reason that it doesn't work is often because the regime holders are usually selfish individuals and won't bite the harms of losing money either way so they don't care about their populace. Like at the end of the day, these dictators aren't the ones taking the pay cut. They're going to maintain the same amount of comfort and the same amount of money in both worlds and as such they have no incentive to care about the fact that people are going to suffer more when we have economic sanctions against them. The other issue is that like now once you have sanctions you can't you can't remove them until the person capitulates because that looks bad on you and like as a western country you don't want to be the one who takes down sanctions until they work because you don't want to seem weak. Unfortunately capitulation vever happens so you don't get any kind of long term solvency and we think this hurts long term democratization as well because recognize the best way to democratize a nation is by building a middle class and building some kind of like free flow of speech but that only happens if you are able to exert your influence somehow which oftentimes comes best through money. We think the best way in which you built like have any chance of building middle classes or having like activism groups is when you have a like a some kind of trade going on when like maybe you've cajoled them into letting amnesty international in so they can provide some kind of service to your people but like sanctions completely cut off that avenue and so can never be effective even in the short term but especially are like stunting our goals into the long term. Our second area of clash is about how it hurts the worst off. Recognize like as I told you dictators aren't the ones taking the big cut just because there's less net money now now even less goes to people through existing welfare programs any kind of government subsidies that existed like now if the dictators worried about acquiring food they just take more of it by force like it's not the case the dictators that are harmed it's only the case that you're starving the people you're trying to save from the regime in the first place. But our third area of clash is about it hurts how it hurts countries who issue sanctions in the first place. Recognize that international trade is an economic tool that is really beneficial to individual nations and individual groups because if I'm able to like buy something more cheaply here that's good for me and if I'm able to sell to a given nation that's also good for me so the problem happens that when you issue economic sanctions whatever that nation used to provide you with or vice versa becomes either more expensive for you to acquire because you have to go to someone who knows you have no other options and so knows they can raise the price or your own goods become cheaper because other countries can exploit you in a similar manner. They can say like look now you have no one to sell it to you so you're going to sell it to us for less and we think that insofar as this like hurts you as well we don't think you ought to be doing it. Proud to propose.
We should fight against global warming. So by global warming we mean man made climate change which we've seen occurred over the twentieth century and into this century due to industry. And by fight against it we mean we should take drastic action to try to limit the scope of future global warming. Three arguments. First, climate change is going to lead to hundreds of millions of people being displaced from their homes. The entire country of bangladesh, for instance, which has about two hundred million people, is in a river basin, which means that it will be under water if sea levels rise even marginally. At the point where no country in the world has the ability to house two hundred million bangladeshi refugees we think it's essential that steps are taken to prevent climate change from happening on such a scale that water's rise. We see that cities like new york are likely to be under water in two hundred years if action isn't taken. So even wealthy countries won't be able to escape this. But ultimately, because no one is prepared for a refugee crisis on this scale, think about how much difficulty we're having dealing with two million syrian refugees, ultimately it would be a humanitarian disaster if climate change were not averted. Our second argument is about why global warming is going to diminish global economic productivity and why this is a disaster. So, right now there's a sort of rising tide that lifts all boats. If you'll allow the kind of joke about rising sea levels, but at the point where the global economy is growing, people living in abject poverty in places like india or sub saharan africa, can expect that their children or their grandchildren will have a higher quality of life because the global economy is growing and it benefits their regions too. Climate change poses a massive threat to economic growth in every region. Why is this so? Think about food production in america. The US is the world's second largest food producer and one of the world's largest food exporters. Due to global warming, it's quite likely that the great plains where all of the american grain is grown are going to get too warm to continue to support large scale agriculture. Now you might think, oh well if america doesn't isn't fertile anymore we can grow things in canada. We can just move north. But the soil is not the same and the conditions are not the same there. So some of the world's most fertile agricultural land is going to become worthless due to climate change. And china, the other major global food producer, faces a risk of desertification due to climate change. Which will also limit food outputs. So we see that there's likely to be a catastrophic reduction in the productivity of the land, which will put millions if not billions of people at risk of food insecurity due to climate change. Our third and final argument is about the unpredictable outcomes of climate change. Recognize that nobody knows what is going to happen when climate change continues. For instance if sea levels rise perhaps we'll end up in some sort of positive feedback loop where because sea levels rise, more ice melts, which leads to sea levels rising even more. Some scientists have proposed that this could lead to a change in the gulf stream, which would cause europe, actually, to become much much colder than it is right now, to the point that it couldn't support its current population. So that's just one existentialist threat to hundreds of millions of people that is difficult to predict right now but that could happen as a result of climate change. At that point we think that we need to take drastic steps to fight against global warming in order to prevent something like that from happening. Or other unforeseeable harmful events from taking place as well. We think it's grossly irresponsible to make decisions when we don't know what the outcomes will be. At that point because we know what the world will look like without climate change, better than with, and we will be better able to cope with its problems, we should fight against global warming. Thank you.
The motion for today's debate is that we should end progressive taxation. The way we're going to model this is fairly simple. We think that above a certain poverty line which can be drawn based on statistics with regards to where the poverty level actually is in the country or, like, the average by which people can support themselves without external help from programs such as medicare or welfare, and we think that people who earn for income above that level of poverty would each have an applied flat tax depending on what the government requires. So, say, if you have a large sprawled-out government, something like the united states, your tax might be fairly high, so a flat tax of maybe ten, fifteen percent, but if your government is smaller, it can stay around five percent, etcetera, etcetera. Two main areas of argumentation: the first on why we think it's fundamentally unjust to have a progressive tax. We think there's a general recognition in society that people have rights to property and that the fruit of someone's labor is property as well. And we think that just because the fruit of your labor changes in semblance, whether it is money or the actual creation of the material, do not change the fact that it is still your property and the fruit of your labor. So let's sketch this out real quick, right? We think that first and foremost, property rights exist. We think it is bad when people steal each other's each other's goods, that if something is within the boundaries of my house, if I built it, if I bought it, then having it taken away from me is a violation of a right, and we find this viscerally to be true. Second level to this then is that if I do something with my body, if I build a cabinet, if I chop some wood, these things become my possessions and we apply property rights to them. But we don't understand why the line stops at money. Why suddenly because my labor, instead of getting a cabinet out of it, I get a couple hundred thousand dollars or etcetera, changes the fact that it is still property and still my right? In fact, we think it's exactly the same thing. Just because instead I'm getting money doesn't mean I own it any less. What this means is that taxation, as a whole, is a kind of theft that needs to be justified, because we think that any taxes on the part of the government are, at their core, an act of like the taking away of property. We we have to understand that it is worth it. So, we think that some redistribution is okay. But you have to warrant why somehow because people are earning more, they also have to be taxed higher than others. Because it is okay to say everyone gets taxed the same in order to benefit others society, but it is not okay to place that undue burden and take more from some. We think that the other side has to warrant this. But more so, we think that this system just isn't circumstance-based enough. Presumably in a flat tax, everybody can afford to pay it, especially if it's applied above a certain poverty level. But the problem with the progressive tax is that, yes, there are some outliers, people who are single people who just want to earn a lot of money, but a lot of the time people work to earn more because they have to support more people, they need to spend more, they're supporting family abroad or have many children, and we think that any kind of system has to recognize these kinds of circumstances. Our second area of clash has to do with general pragmatic impacts. First we want to talk about why it discourages people from working harder, reaching for those promotions, being real innovators. We think that a lot of the time people are motivated by the amount of money they're going to make. But if the amount of money you're going to make is going to be marginally more than the amount that you make previously, because a lot of that money is getting sucked out through progressive taxes, then you're probably not going to feel very motivated to work for a promotion that is also going to make you work many more hours. We think people make these tradeoffs. They say, " I'm willing to spend more hours in the office and less hours doing the things that I love and seeing the people that I want to see because I want more money. " But if you're not getting more money and you're just wasting that time and that energy, we don't think people are going to do it anymore. Second, though, we think that there are inner class tensions that develop specifically because of the progressive taxes. Because even if you don't buy that it is unjust, it is true that rich people, in general, do think it is unjust. They stop donating to charities, they stop wanting to support good policy decisions in the long term, because they feel like they are being taken advantage of, and we think at least in order to prevent those impacts, we ought not have a progressive tax. For these reasons, proud to propose.
We should limit birth control. What we mean by this is that we're not actually limiting something like condoms. I think we're talking entirely about hormonal birth control, IE, the pill, the nuvaring, the shot, depo-provera, so on so forth. And by limit, we would mean that anyone under the age of eighteen would require a doctor visit before they would be prescribed the pill or the ring or any other hormonal birth control that they prefer. So, in the status quo, there are oftentimes online doctors or like telephone calls or over-the-counter versions of the pill, or like parents can pick them up for their children, we don't want any of that. We want there to be like a distinct " I am under eighteen years old. I want to use this thing, " but we think that condoms would still be available easily over-the-counter. We're not changing that. Three main areas of clash: first, on my hormones are dangerous to young bodies. Recognize that the side effects that we often don't talk to are talk about are actually very, very large, such as a lot of women who take the pill suffer from depression as a direct result of it. And this is something that often goes under-researched because the scientific industry is incredibly sexist, but we do like these things do happen and can be very bad. This is in addition to occasionally hormonal treatments can do things like cause cancers or different kinds of tumors, and we think the problem in the status quo is that we have this lackadaisy attitude where we pretend that these are fake problems that don't really affect many people, without recognizing that these are very real risks that individuals should have the ability to consult consent to first. We think this is especially bad for younger children. Because if I'm a thirty-year-old woman who has contextualized the rest of my life, and like has recognized that that's a tradeoff I am willing to make, like I really just want the ease of doing of just having the pill once a day or the ease of like sliding in the nuvaring once a month, then we think that that's a tradeoff that you, as an adult, can make. But not only can the side effects be a lot worse for younger bodies because you are someone who is still developing, it's also just something you can't contextualize because you're not someone who has been exposed to very much depression. You're not someone who has seen these kinds of impacts on other people or read as much about them by nature of the fact that you are younger. We think that these are long-term impacts for birth birth control that is not particularly necessary given the existence of condoms and spermicide that are available over-the-counter and work perfectly well. Our second area of clash is about promoting informed consent, because we think there's a problem in the status quo where individuals pretend that birth control isn't a big deal, and for a lot of people it isn't. But we think it's important to recognize the potential for damage that it can do and make sure that individuals are informed of that. And we think the easiest way to make sure that they are informed is making sure that they have to do something like talk to a professional about the thing they're about to put into their bodies before they actually start doing it on the daily. In the status quo, people get the majority of their information off the internet or from their parents when it comes to this kind of birth control stuff. And maybe that's okay, because we recognize that a lot of information is available on the internet, but we also think that children and young like younger people are uniquely bad at being thorough when it comes to these subjects. So sitting down and talking to a professional about the way this might interact with your body, or your history, or if you're someone who's like prone to anxiety and depression, whether or not this is still something you ought do, or having knowledge of what an ectopic pregnancy might look like, all of these things are things you're less likely to find online that a doctor will mention you, and we think that promoting that education is very important. Our third area of clash is about promoting proper use because we think that oftentimes personalized medicine is best, even if the general one can be used either like will function, IE, sure, you can give me a pill for birth control and it'll work, regardless of my weight, the majority of the time, but it's always going to be more effective if it is something that is personalized to my weight, to my habits, to my, like, sleep schedules, so on so forth. And we think that that's something that a doctor can do for you, like, go over your specific situation and choose a type. Proud to propose.
The motion for today's debate is that we should ban genetically modified crops. We're gonna model this as we would allow the research and we would allow special waivers for the production of genetically modified crops if it is for the purpose of research but would ban the sale and production of genetically modified crops. Three main areas of clash, first on preventing ownership over the crops and their future. Currently GMO's are controlled by corporations and this isn't something that is ever going to change insofar as this is like largely a corporate interest something that they see as like being able to make a lot of money off of then we've already established like the initial patents that solidifies these monopolies and when they own the patents and they own the seeds they don't allow farmers to breed and select their own plants. This first of all we think blatantly encroaches on farmers' property rights insofar as like we've already sold this item to them we don't understand why like groups like monsanto get to still control the future production of them. We think this is a really bad standard of ownership to set where we say that like even after you've sold something then a different group can still claim ownership because of a patent insofar as this like inherently limits things that are often outside of farmers' control. Like first we'd say that it is necessary to their trade and necessary to farming to be able to control your own seeds. That's the only way that small farmers can develop and the only way that like anyone besides large factory farms that can afford this can ever grow. But more than that, we just think that this like is antithetical to a lot of other issues right like if a seed happens to travel on the air and settle into a farmer's land with non GMO non monsanto crops now monsanto can still claim ownership of them because it's its seeds have crossed pollenated with them and we think that's really dangerous because this isn't something that people ever actually controlled. But we also think that it means that if these kinds of that you can run the small farms out of business entirely because they can't afford the same seeds that grow more quickly like recognize that these kind of GMO crops are always more efficient like this is just true to the point where it's like always market preferable to grow them. The problem is that they're also quite expensive because of the patents that we are worried about and so small farms can never compete which is bad for the economy and bad for anyone who doesn't want to eat GMO food. It's also really bad for efficiency. Farmers are really good at selecting seeds generationally to be best for their environment. Groups like monsanto may have all the scientists in the world but they can't specialize their seeds between regions like it's really different what's going to grow well in new mexico versus new england and the only way that you can control that generationally and control that evolution is if you are capable of replanting the seeds that have grown the best in the past. Our second area of clash is about how it's bad for the environment. GMO crops are created to be pesticide resistance this encourages the use of pesticides because you know it's not going to kill off your actual crop so you use it in order to in order to like kill off anything extra and like you're able to use even more of it and make sure that nothing extra grows because they're resistant. This is really bad because it drians into your water, poisons other crops, all of that and like that's bad both for like any other crops that might grow there but also bad for the groundwater that we then need to be able to drink and needs to be able to feed the rest of like animals and other plants. So we think that that's really damaging. Our third area of clash is about allowing research and development. GMO's have the potential to be incredibly helpful to tons of people economically and nutritiously, but releasing them early as they are developed does two things. First it begs political outrage. Religious groups throw fits about it being ungodly, paranoid health freaks worry about potential health effects, and because we don't have the research fully developed we don't have any way of definitively saying look here are the millions of studies we've conducted that have shown that there's no damage. This creates groups that can lobby against funding for research, that can stymy any kind of small groups that want to look into this and that's really bad but the second thing it does is that it prevents the best research from occurring. Monopolies establish themselves, dominate the market, and disincentivize any small research group from doing anything because they already know they're not going to be able to make as much money of it and they're not going to be able to compete with the patent law. We think we need to give these groups a chance and give GMO's a real chance. Proud to propose.
We should ban alternative medicine for two big reasons. First, because it hurts people directly and second, because it creates an opportunity cost for funding and focus on real medication. So first, why should we ban alternative medicine? It creates very clear and obvious direct harms towards the people it hurts. Now, I think it's a generally accepted idea that the government should ban things that are harmful to people. Obviously, the government bans things like heroin. It bans a lot of non-FDA approved drugs. It bans a whole lot of other things as well, and it bans these things because we believe that the government has a duty to protect its people from things that could be that they could be coerced into taking that could be harmful. So why is this true? Because the population aren't medical experts. The population isn't able to fully understand what any given medical compound is going to do to them, and it is therefore very easy for them to be misled into taking things that could be harmful for them, without fully understanding the consequences, and that's obviously not good. But another reason why they could be misled into taking these kinds of things is because and to alternative medicine, more specifically, is because there is a hope element to this. Oftentimes if you're you could be taking an alternative medicine, it could be im they could have less side effects than conventional medicine, it could be cheaper, it could be more enjoyable, it could be a whole lot of other things as well. So that's another reason why people may be led into taking alternative medicine. So, obviously this isn't very good because at the very best, alternate medicines have no proven record at all of efficacy. So they're not actually doing anything for you, you're just wasting your money on it. But the worst case is that some alternative medicines could be very bad. They could react poorly with conventional treatments, they could do harm to you on their very own inherently, and this is very bad. And this is very bad, especially not just because it's bad, but also because there's no benefits accrued as a point of comparison. So there's no even real reason why this is necessary to take or benefits. Any benefits cannot actually be isolated to alternative medicine itself. So, now that we've established that, next going to talk about the opportunity cost point. So, this is also very important because all of the billions of dollars that get invested into researching and ultimately disproving anything beneficial about alternative medicine comes at a cost first and because it takes a long time to confirm these kinds of things. So first and foremost, if the government is funding research and on alternative medicine, it's not funding research on real medicine. And this is a big problem because the development of actual drugs, drugs that save people's lives, can be an incredibly expensive and incredibly long process, and increase funding for this kind increase this process, make it quicker, and this could result in a whole bunch of lives being saved if a cure or if or a more effective treatment is even found a few months earlier. But the second thing is that all of this money being spent on alternative medicine additionally also is money that cannot be spent on facilitating access to conventional medicine networks. So rather than spending billions of dollars on researching and proving that these stupid medicines don't work anyway, what they can do is they can spend all of this money on making it so that existing health care that we know works is more affordable and accessible. So if we want to ensure that there is a healthier population, one that's going to be more productive and more financially capable and also just, in general, better off population, I think it's very clear that we should ban alternative medicine.
We should increase reforestation. By this, we mean that we should dramatically increase the amount of resources that are put into existing reforestation efforts, and in places where reforestation isn't taking place but that were historically forested, we would introduce those sorts of efforts. We have three arguments for our side. The first is about carbon capture. The idea behind this is, essentially, that there is too much carbon in the atmosphere right now, represented by CO two, and that one of the best ways to remove that carbon from the atmosphere is to put it into trees. As we all know, one of the ways that plants grow is to draw carbon out of the atmosphere. So if we plant hundreds of acres of trees, we're also taking a small amount of carbon out of the atmosphere. One reason for the increased amount of carbon in the atmosphere is that people have been burning the earth's carbon stores. Things like oil, and coal, and rainforest have historically been where the earth has put all of its excess carbon, which is why we have relatively low carbon levels right now. One way that we could take advantage of the earth's ability to store carbon would be to sequester it in the form of trees. We can't create new oil. We can't create new coal, at least not efficiently. So the closest thing we can do to return the earth to its state before the industrial revolution would be to plant huge forests and prevent people from burning them again in the future so that as much carbon as possible gets sequestered back in these forest, out of the atmosphere. Now, of course, this isn't a fix-all solution for climate change, but it is a bandaid while we transition to greener technology, so we think it's something that's absolutely worthwhile. Our second argument is about the value of reforestation from an aesthetic and environmental perspective. So, essentially, what we mean is that, first of all, if you think about reforestation in urban areas, which is often overlooked, planting large amounts of trees in any open available space in a city like los angeles, such as in the median, and along sides of roads, and in abandoned lots and the like, first of all, creates an city environment that's more welcoming. People just feel better when they have this greenery around, and that's why people find certain cities so beautiful, because there's lots of trees. But, moreover, it also reduces the heat in that city. There is an effect called an urban heat island where lots of pavement in big cities means the temperatures are hotter, which means air quality is worse, which hurts people with asthma, but if we plant lots of trees, you get more shade, and trees also absorb some of that ambient heat, so this is less of a problem. And in rural areas, when you recreate these areas, first of all, it's likely that if an area was once forested and you plant lots of trees of the right species that you'll be able to reintroduce species that have gone extinct in an area or that have become more rare, so that you can create more habitats for indigenous wildlife, and we think that's something that's really good as well. Effectively, this isn't just about planting more trees, it's about creating a space in which people feel more comfortable and in which the types of environment that were destroyed to make room for agriculture or for cities can be restored, so that we can share the earth more responsibly with other species. And our final argument is about the effect that this has on jobs. Some people might think that this would actually hurt jobs in agriculture, but we would argue that the jobs that are created by reforestation and forest management efforts will actually be good for an environment or for an area in the long term. We think that you can bring in lots of jobs in forest management and potentially also by harvesting trees, by chopping some of them down, and then planting new ones as many areas do, you can create jobs in the lumber industry as well. So for all of these reasons, we should increase reforestation. Thank you.
We should subsidize electric cars. Electric cars are the future. There's little doubt about that. We say that sometimes even the future needs a little push. Two arguments in this speech. A, on why electric cars are vastly better than just normal cars that operate on fuel, and secondly, why do we think that a subsidy is required. First argument, let's make this short because we think it's fairly obvious and if opposition chooses to oppose this then we will further elaborate in the rebuttal speech. Three reasons on why we think electric cars are infinitely more beneficial. A, there is an ongoing crisis of fuel in the world and sooner or later this nonrenewable resource is going to dwindle down and become more and more expensive and we're all going to be in a very serious problem. B, the pollution that results from the emissions that these cars admit is immense. C, relying on fuel forces the entire world to become dependent on countries that are very rich with oil what creates some very severe diplomatic problems. Transition like a smooth transition to electric cars solves all of these problems once and for all. Now obviously there are some technical problems today with electric cars but that is the function of the like amount of demand that is not wide enough today as it is for normal cars. We say that once more and more people are going to use this then all of these small technical problems are going to go away eventually. Second argument, why do we think that a subsidy is in place? So allegedly the logic of the free market and the open competition says that if the product that we're talking about is so good that it will prevail on its own and there is no need to help the process in an artificial way, but in reality, things don't always work like that. In reality electric cars had the huge misfortune of posing a threat to not just one but several of the most powerful lobbies in the world. We are mainly discussing discussing of course the car industry and the fuel industry, and we think that the reasons for this goes without saying. Why is this important though, because not only is developing those like electric cars that work good enough, is a huge investment on its own, but you also have to deploy like infrastructure which means that cooperation from state officials is crucial here. At the point at which all of the people that you are dependent on in order to like develop your product are currently under immense pressure from lobbyists to operate against you, then you find yourself waging an uphill battle and it no longer matters how good your product is you will simply not be successful at producing a product that is going to be like cheap enough in order for there to be to be like demand for it. So what happens today is that we have a small group of very wealthy people with a very strong incentive, an interest, that is successful in withholding changes that could potentially revolutionize the life of everyone in society and improve everyone's conditions, but nobody has a strong enough incentive or a strong enough interest in order to fight this. This is a classic collective action problem. Why is subsidy going to be helpful in this case? We say that the subsidy is going to help to in like in balancing all of these hostile factors that are in play and restore the competitiveness to the automobile market. It is like we can think of it as a smart investment for the long run because as soon as the electric car is going to be the most common tool of transportation, then we get all of the all of the benefits that we've discussed earlier both environmental benefits and financial benefits and we say that aside from a few filthy rich industrialists everyone is going to be better off. Please propose.
We should end the use of economic sanctions. By this we mean that countries like the US and european union countries should stop cutting off trade and access to international resources to poor more vulnerable countries in order to get them to change policy. The most egregious example of economic sanctions in recent years was the oil for food program in iraq in the nineteen nineties. During this period iraq was only able to export oil in exchange for food. This led to dictator saddam hussein coming up with egregious workarounds that led to half a million people starving due to a lack of food in the country. The private market was no longer allowed to bring food into the country, it could only come in if saddam hussein was willing to do the right thing. And surprise surprise, this murderous dictator was not. As I said, half a million people, most of them under the age of eighteen, starved to death in iraq in the nineteen nineties, whereas previously there had been no food insecurity in the country. And it is entirely due to economic sanctions led by the united states. Our first argument, quite simply, is that is unethical because it instrumentalizes the people who live in a country. The effectiveness of sanctions relies on making the people who live in a country so desperate, that they will rise up and force their government to change its policy. This might mean starving enough iraqis that they're willing to rise up against saddam hussein, something that didn't happen before the american invasion, or it might mean for instance preventing iranians from importing medicine that they desperately need in order to try to get them to vote for different politicians. Either way we don't think that starving people or denying them access to medical technology is ever going to be acceptable. And this is the only way that sanctions work. Supporters of sanctions try to say that they're targeted at the elite. But that kind of sanction has never been effective. Freezing russian oligarchs bank accounts doesn't make them change their government policies, it just makes them double down to try to earn their money back. And ultimately they know that they can still get their money pretty easily if they just resign from their post. The only effective type of sanction is the kind that puts people out to the streets for a revolution because they can't corn to feed their children. And we think this is disgusting. It treats people as just a means to an end for foreign policy in highly developed countries, who oftentimes have no empathy for the people who are suffering. The western news media is extremely complicit in this by refusing to show the effects on real people that economic sanctions have. This is evil. It's just as evil as when the british would starve people in india during the colonial period. And it's fundamentally no different. But aside from the extremely severe moral concerns I have about this, we also think that the use of sanctions is fundamentally arbitrary and that this leads to countries having more extreme behavior. Right now for instance we see that sanctions are aren't actually applied to the worst human rights abusers, they're just applied to the countries that western countries want to have more power over. They are very literally a tool for imperialism. Right now venezuela is not one of the world's worst human rights abusers, despite what american news will tell you. Venezuela doesn't have death squads or concentration camps. It's just a slightly less democratic country than most western forms. Meanwhile, venezuela is being sanctioned while western countries are pouring money on assad, who used chemical weapons on his own people, because he listens to them and supports them whereas the venezuelan government has refused to kowtow to the american government. Similarly, countries with large manufacturing bases like china are able to do whatever they want while a more isolated country like venezuela can be bullied by the international community. Sanctions are not applied to the worst offenders, they're not applied to countries that act especially badly. Oftentimes they're applied to countries like iran that just want to defend themselves from aggressive neighbors, and they're being punished arbitrarily by western powers because they refuse to be part of this new imperialist system. We don't think western countries have any right to dictate policy in other countries and therefore that sanctions are inherently unjust. For these reasons, and many others I don't have the time to say right now, we must end the use of sanctions. Thank you.
Nationalism does more harm than good. So, by nationalism we mean the intense love of a nation. So, a good example of this might be that, some people in quebec very much love the idea of french canada, more so than they love other parts of their identity. So, we think that that's a good example of nationalism. So, three arguments: the first is that, we think nationalism is very divisive. Recognize that, nations must compete with one another for nationalism to make sense. Everyone's sense of love for their own nation is comparative: if you love quebec you don't love english speaking canada, for instance. So, we think that, necessarily, this create some sort of divide between people, who are members of different nations, and some sort of feeling that, one nation is in competition with every other nation. This is a lot of problems: first, in terms of rebellions. We see that, although there hasn't been a lot of violence in recent years in quebec, historically, in other parts of the world, nationalism has been a big driver of violence. World war one for instance, started because of nationalism in the balkans that made people resent the austrian empire. Even though the governments, that replaced the austrian empire, weren't that different from the empire itself, people wanted to have a serbian king, rather than a german king, and that's what led to a lot of the conflict that, led to millions and millions of people dying, and this has been a recurring story throughout modern history. We've seen nationalist rebellions in countries, from eastern europe to germany itself, to southeast asia, and africa, and millions of people have died as a result, even though the living conditions of people in those countries probably didn't improve as a result. We think that, the natural outcome, therefore, of nationalism is that this divisiveness will lead to conflict, and war between nations. Our second point is that nationalism is exclusive, and we think that this is a really dangerous thing, most people can't choose to opt in, or opt out, of the nation that they're part of. It's kind of like being black or white, you're born into a certain nation. So, if you're born in a certain part of canada you're quebecois, and if you're born elsewhere in canada you're not. If you're born in one country, you're part of a certain nation, if you're born elsewhere, in the same country, you're part of a different nation. So, we see that this could be very dangerous for minority groups, particularly, if you have a country that's based on a certain national identity, like say, germany being based on german identity, then people who live within the borders of that country, but aren't part of the nation, are always going to be viewed with suspicion. This was a huge driver in anti semitic crimes in germany in the twentieth century, that jewish people, who lived in germany, and might have lived there for hundreds of years since the middle ages, were seen as not being part of the german nation, so they were actually a risk to the country, and this allowed leaders to scapegoat the jewish people, and this can be seen time and time again. For jewish people, this has been a huge problem throughout history, as jews have been seen as not part of the nation, of the country, that they live in, but part of a jewish nation instead. But this isn't the only example, if you look at chinese people in southeast asia, even if their ancestors have lived in a country like thailand for a hundred and fifty years, they're still viewed as part of the chinese nation, and viewed with suspicion, even though they're a citizen of thailand, and have been there for a very long time. We think that, this ultimately means that, minority groups will be treated worse by the majority group, because they'll be seen as not part of the nation, and not really belonging in their own home country. Which leads nicely into our last point, about why we think nationalism leads to unrealistic expectations. We think that, countries and nations almost never perfectly overlap. One reason is that, while countries have firm borders, the US canadian border is at a certain line on the map, nations tend to bleed over. We see that, in places like europe, you have german speakers, living outside germany, who identify as part of the german nation, and this was one of the leading causes of world war two, was a desire to unify the german nation into one country. But, when you have areas that are thirty percent german, and thirty percent polish, and forty percent czech, how do you reconcile that? We think that, nationalism leads to an expectation that you can unify your nation, but that's never possible without large scale population transfers, or terrible crimes being committed. A good example of this would be greece and turkey, two countries that have a lot of national enmity historically. In the early twentieth century, all turks were exiled from greece to turkey, and all greeks were exiled from turkey to greece, and millions of people lost their homes, and no good came of it for the people who actually lived in those areas. But because of nationalism, it was expected that this would be good. Nationalism encourages a certain naive idealism, that we don't think that can ever be resolved, without really harming the people, who were affected by the policies created as a result. So for these reasons, I think it's very clear that nationalism does more harm than good.
We should end mandatory retirement, because it is absolutely a form of age based discrimination, and that is just on face entirely unjust. So, let's talk about what this looks like. I think that it's important to note that, people obviously do not age in the same way, in that well, clearly some people get alzheimer's, or become like less physically capable of doing various tasks, or are they just do, you even if they're still capable, they just do those tasks slower. Obviously some of these things are true of some people, as they age, however, this certainly isn't true of all people. There's a lot of people who are, maybe, just biologically lucky, and they don't have a lot of these problems, and there's also a whole lot of people who actively put in a whole lot of effort, to like take care of their body, specifically so they can keep working, and specifically so they stay healthy. And I think that when you force these people into retirement, you're taking away a lot from them, you're taking away their ability to enjoy their livelihood, you're you're paternalizing their choices about the basic way, in which they want to live their life. You're basically forcing them into like the final stages of their life. And, I think that this is a real problem. I think that this is especially a problem when you look at this as terms of scale, given that we live in a society, where people are able to live for longer and longer periods of time, you're talking about how you're sentencing these people to, essentially, retire, when they may have thirty years left to live. They may have forty years, or even fifty years left to live. So I think that, this is a huge problem, because I think that first and foremost, as far as like profit is concerned, as far as like wanting to make a living is concerned, if people want to keep working, so they can make more money, whether it's so, like, they want to like give more money to like their descendants, or they just want to make more money, so they have more money to spend on luxuries, because you know, when you're seventy years old, you probably want to take that extra nice vacation, or buy that nicer thing, or whatever or a nicer new car. You may just want to you want have extra money to spend on these kind of luxuries, that you've probably earned throughout a lifetime of work, and you want to make the choice of working longer to pay for those kinds of things, or maybe you just feel that, for you personally, retirement kinda sounds boring, and that you enjoy your work, you enjoy what you're doing with your life, you think that it gives you some more value, and some more meaning to society, and I think that's incredibly important to note too. And, it makes you feel part of something, and I think that this is incredibly disrespectful to the people, who have worked their entire lives, to then just say: once you reach this certain arbitrary cut off point, once you reach this arbitrary date, then suddenly your value becomes zero, then suddenly you become a drain, a drag, and in order to make sure that like, that economic profits of a company are being protected, or maybe to ensure that there's no kind of like liabilities or accidents, which you can probably just regulate on the individual level, you're just going to throw all that away to force people to retire. I just don't think that's right, and therefore we should and mandatory retirement.
Organ donation should be mandatory. So by this we mean that liberal democracies like the US, canada, britain, ought to require people to add themselves to organ donation lists, and should require them to give up tissue if they are called upon. So we think that living people might be asked to give part of like their liver or something like that, and that the deceased ought have any necessary organs harvested if it's going to save someone else's life. So that's our stance in this debate. Two arguments. The first is about why we think needy people are more deserving of organs than anyone else. So we think first of all that for a living donor, yes, there's a certain amount of pain and inconvenience and risk when you go in for a surgery to have some of your tissue removed, but that all of these things are outweighed by saving another person's life. We think that first of all, we can probably offer some sort of compensation as a reward for people who give tissue. You know, make up for their time that they're losing it work and things like that. But at the end of the day we think that saving someone's life because we're giving them a new liver or a new kidney is always going to be better than preventing a little bit of pain and inconvenience for someone else. And in terms of the deceased, I think there's no way that the other side can get up here and say that someone's desire to be buried or cremated in a certain condition outweighs another person's right to life. In a a body is an inanimate object, it doesn't have any sort of rights whatsoever, and we don't think that the person's family or community has a greater claim to it than someone who's very life is at risk if they don't have access to the organs from that body. So we think that in every instance, particularly in the instance of the deceased, they should be required to put all their organs up so that people in need are able to access them. We think that furthermore, that since healthcare is a fundamental right according to the constitutions of many countries and their laws, and also according to things like the UN declaration of human rights, that governments need to take a radical action to better protect the health of people who aren't very wealthy. We see that around the world there are many more people who need organs then their organs available. So those with the most wealth and privilege and power are the only ones who are ever able to access these organ transplants. We think governments should take radical action to increase the supply of organs so that people who aren't as fortunate will also be able to access them, and the only way to do that is to have mandatory donation, because there's no way that they're just going to convince people to give these away for free otherwise on the other side of the house. At that point, we think it's clear that governments need to step in and take action here because people who are in desperate need of organs are not able to access them right now in the status quo. But our second argument is that is twofold. First, we say that ethically, we always ought donate organs. We think that if something is a universalizable, basically if everyone were to do an action and that action would be better for society or the world, then that action is probably the right thing to do. And we can see that if everyone in the world were to give up you know a little bit of organ tissue that they don't need to live in order to save a child's life, that the world be a better place. And if every dead body had its organs harvested, then we probably wouldn't need very many living people to get tissue first of all, and secondly, we would be saving living people at the expense of the dead. I think it's clear that this would always be the right thing to do. So at that point we tell you that the state needs to take action to make the ethical thing happen. We think states are ethical actors who need to act according to the same standards as individuals because they're made up of and represent individuals. The other team might say that government shouldn't be bound by the same morality as ordinary people, but at the point where presidents and prime ministers are ordinary people, we think that they need to act in a fundamentally ethical way when they make decisions about how the government should use its power. So at that point, because on our side we are saving people's lives, particularly people without a lot of privilege and money, because we are allocating a very limited resource in the most effective possible way, and because this is the right thing to do, organ donation should be mandatory.
We should ban abortion because ultimately it is immoral. It is immoral in the fact that we need to make sure that we value life and the potential for a human life as an incredibly valuable idea and secondarily, because when you're making moral decisions, you should look to probability in cases of probability and uncertainty, you should defer to the least possible harmful alternatives. So in the case of abortion, you should defer to making choices that aren't potentially harmful to a human life. So, before we get into the meat of this argument though, there are a couple of situations in which it's very clear to make sure where I don't foresee this ban applying. I do not foresee this ban applying to cases where an abortion is necessary to save the life of a mother or it is otherwise necessary for the health of the mother. I also do not foresee this ban enacting it for some reason the child's health would be at risk and this would be a better solution. I also further do not see in cases of rape, for example, abortion should also be allowed in those circumstances, other extenuating circumstances like that. Additionally, we also think that it's important to defend a world in which contraceptive access condom access and sexual education access are much more widespread, better funded and better accessible because ultimately, these are a lot of the lack of like education on that front or the lack of access to contraceptives for a lot of people are what make, in many cases, abortions necessary in the first place. So, now that that is established, let's get into why given those circumstances, abortion is immoral. So, it's quite obvious that there is nothing more important than human life. Every good thing that you have ever experienced, are experiencing, or will experienced is possible because of this. In a way, that is why we look at murder as the worse crime of all crime. Because murder is essentially the destruction of your own universe from an individualist prospective. When you are murdered, everything that you can experience is dead, there's nothing left for you. So, given this, there should be an incredibly high bar towards allowing this to happen. And we think that given that there's a lot of circumstances where and given that there is otherwise abortion is a choice, if you take out circumstances where the life of the mother is at risk or where rape was taken place or where you didn't have the financial access to contraceptives or condoms or things like that, ultimately therefore, abortion is just a choice. And therefore, since it is a choice, it should be something that can be regulated and regulated in this way, because you're essentially balancing the fact that having a child could be something that maybe you don't want to do or you don't feel ready to do. However, even if those are very legitimate concerns, they can't balance against the fact that you're essentially making it so that an entire human life cannot be experience, something that is the ultimate moral harm that outweighs that. But the next thing that I want to talk about is about probability and uncertainty. So this is very important because one standard that's often discussed when it comes to abortions is the idea of viability. And when you're talking about viability, this is in many ways a moving target. People don't exactly know when viability does exist, and it's also an ever like increasing range. This also presents a problem because where therefore when you should defer against like viability or you don't know exactly what, because it's difficult to like get comprehensive medical understandings of like what a fetus can actually experience as far as like pain or cognition, we would argue that when you're doing this you should defer towards minimizing the possible harms. Because the harms that can be experienced from this are quite great, and therefore you should defer against these moral farms. So, for all of those reasons, think it's very clear that you should ban abortions.
We should legalize public nudity. The only reason that public nudity is a law in this country is because certain individuals have puritanical ideas and believe that the body is inherently sinful or problematic. These ideas should not be reflected in our policy and certainly should not be putting people in jail or landing people with a large fine. For this reason we would support the following model: that all western liberal democracies should immediately legalize public nudity. This does not mean that individuals can be obscene or can essentially be sexual towards certain other people, they're simply allowed to exist without clothing. That is to say if I'm walking down the street in cloths or unclothed I should be treated the same. But if I start making advances towards people if I start urinating on the streets I can still be punished under other laws. Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first is on the criminalization of homelessness. Many individuals in western liberal democracies are denied shelters simply because they don't have the economic means to reach it. Furthermore individuals are regularly homeless both simply because of chance or happenstance or the bad economy, but also because of mental illnesses. These individuals need to be able to change in the streets if they ever want to change their clothes. Because we believe these people deserve some certain human dignity, deserve the ability to change their clothes, we believe it ought not be criminalized for them to go nude for brief periods of time. In the status quo we put individuals in jail, because they are homeless, due to odd policies like this. This is essentially a way for us to clean up the streets, in a manner of speaking, in a way that is fundamentally dehumanizing. We believe that this continues cycles of poverty when you put individuals in jail and deny them further economic opportunities, because no one wants to hire the sex offender who was at one point publicly nude simply because they were changing. Because there is always a competition for jobs, if individuals have this on the record they cannot raise themselves out of homelessness and poverty and we are being fundamentally unjust as a society. My second argument is that we reduce the norms of chastity and -tanical norms in our country and around the world. We believe that many harms in the status quo are due to these problematic norms that we see. When individuals are denied abortion rights it is typically on religious ends. When individuals cannot be themselves in public when they, when being trans or gay is banned, this is because we are steeped in the ideology of of puritans, of chastity, which we must necessarily remove from all political spheres. This is the first step, is removing public nudity as a criminal offense, as it will clearly signal to the government and all people that these norms are outdated and that they ought past different policies. My third argument is on gender equality. Obviously in the status quo men can not go completely nude. In the world that we are defending they could. However, we see massive harms in the status quo where women cannot essentially go around shirtless, cannot go around without a bra, because of policies which says that that is a criminal offense and criminally nude. This is problematic for a few reasons: first, we think that individuals, by having their body controlled by the government, fundamentally have their autonomy controlled as well. When the government says that it is it is so fundamental that it deserves the power to determine what you wear and who you are, is abusing the rights of its citizens. But secondly, individuals are regularly harassed or condemned due to things like breast feeding in public, even though it is a necessity for them to continue going about their daily lives. We believe that signaling that public nudity is legal will also decrease the stigma around things like breast feeding, because the nude aspects of it which are being criticized will stop being a public moral bad. For this reason we should legalize public nudity.
Surrogacy should be banned. So, by this we mean a practice in which people who want to have a child but, for whatever reason, are unable to will enter into a contract with a woman and she will bring a child to term on behalf of those people and then give up the child to them legally when the baby is born. So, normally, you have a contract that's signed where the woman agrees to bring the child to term and then turn it over once it's born and these people will pay for medical expenses and sometimes women will even accept money in return. So, you have instances when it's done for altruistic reasons and instances when it's done for commercial reasons. So, with that in mind, we think both types of surrogacy should be banned. Two arguments: first is that we think that surrogacy contracts are inherently exploitative towards the biological mother. We think that effectively what you see with surrogacy is that young women are being pressured into selling their body and their health at great risk, and in other instances, society wouldn't accept this, so they shouldn't accept it now. We think that it's very difficult for someone who's never been pregnant to internalize the harms of pregnancy. We think that things like your ability to work during pregnancy and your ability to carry out your daily life vary tremendously from person to person and from pregnancy to pregnancy. Obviously, no two pregnancies are the same, as any mother of multiple children will tell you. So, we think that it's very difficult for the young mother, particularly if she's never done this before or never been pregnant before, to actually internalize the risk that she's taking and then set a fair price. So, we think that what's very likely to happen is that prices will be set artificially low and then that in order to compete, anyone who wants to become a surrogate will be forced to set the price lower than they actually should, based on the risk. But because many of the people who enter into surrogacy contracts will probably be people who were in a financially difficult situation and aren't really free to negotiate, we think that they're effectively being taken advantage of by wealthier families who want to conceive these children. And I'd also like to point out that there's tremendous potential for abuse. You might see a partner or a parent pressure a young woman into agreeing to be a surrogate, despite the health risks, despite the potential harms, in order to get money out of them. Now, society prevents women from having sex for money and doing other acts that would let them basically sell their body and their well-being for financial benefit. So, we don't think that you should allow this policy which is effectively the same thing. The risks are very much the same as prostitution, so we don't think that you should allow it if you're not okay with that. Our next argument then is about why we think these contracts are unenforceable and ultimately not good for the state to permit. So, recognize that in the status quo, the only time that you can take away a baby from its mother is if she is mistreating it or has been shown by the court to be unable to care for the child. Otherwise, almost every government around the world really reprioritizes letting a child stay with its mother. So, we think that the result of that is if you have an instance where someone brings this child to term and wants to keep it in violation of the surrogacy contract, it's going to be very difficult to actually enforce that contract because you're in a really difficult situation. Either the court upholds a surrogacy contract and takes away a baby from its mother or the court overturns the contract and these people lose their money. We think that either situation is really undesirable and we think that this will be a common problem. We think that many times, it's probably going to happen that a mother will have the child and then naturally feel an attachment towards that child and want to keep it, even though it's a violation of the contract, so we think that this is likely to be a big problem. This is probably going to clog up the courts and we also think that these trials are unlikely to be fair. We think that since the couple who wants to have a surrogate mother is probably very wealthy since this process is expensive, that they're always going to get better representation and they will win cases unfairly, simply because they can hire better attorneys or better represent themselves. But on top of that, we think that because this issue is so fraught it would be better for the courts to avoid it entirely, and the only way to do that is to ban surrogacy. So, ultimately, because we think surrogacy is unfair to the mothers and because we think that these contracts are going to be difficult to uphold and lead to a lot of problems for the courts, surrogacy should be banned.
We should ban genetically modified crops. We argue that the consumption of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, is essentially equivalent to experimenting on humans and might be incredibly risky. Two arguments in the speech: firstly, on why we just don't know enough yet, and then, secondly, on why labeling isn't enough in this case. First argument: why we just don't know enough yet. So while it is true that some studies have found GMOs to be harmless, this is a matter that is very far from being scientifically settled. The fact is many countries, big countries, including france and russia, bans these products based on health concerns made by specialists. In fact, the majority of the studies in the US supporting GMOs were conducted by, or at the request of, the companies manufacturing GMOs, which is of course hugely problematic in terms of the findings and the conclusions that they came to and how much they are reliable. And even if those studies were perfectly objective, we think that they are still not reassuring enough, simply because GMOs are a relatively new invention. They'd only been consumed since roughly the late nineties, and that's not nearly enough time to seriously test and and gauge and appreciate the long-term effects of having a genetically modified diet. After all, there are legitimate reasons to be concerned here when dealing with a precedent that's never been tried before anywhere in history and is rapidly becoming one of the main sources of nutrition, for the western world at least. Second argument: why labeling isn't enough. So, the other side might go up and argue that even if there's there are some health concerns, that's still not a good enough reason to ban GMOs, but we can simply label them in a way that allows each consumer to choose whether to buy them or not, just like we do with other things that are not healthy or that are controversial. Here's the problem with that: GMOs tend to cost cheaper than natural crops. That's like that makes sense since they can be grown all year round and so on. This means that, specifically for poor consumers that need to save on every dime, there isn't really a choice but to purchase them, whether they like to or not, and we think that this is wrong and enough of a reason to ban GMOs for now, at least up until that point which it really has been proven harmless in the long run as well. What side government stands for in this debate is not against GMOs principally, but behind the principle that says that at least until we can make certain that something some new thing, that's never been tried before, doesn't have a catastrophical effect, we must err on the side of caution and not allow corporate interests to dictate, to rather control, our common sense. Very proud to propose.
The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish term limits. Two main areas of clash, first on why this creates a more democratic system. Recognize that it allows peoples' preferences to control outcomes while term limits remove individuals' options and limit democracy. It's paternalistic of the government to limit terms because they assume that people can't kick out politicians who are bad for them or who have gone sour over time. Rather we think that the government is supposed to be a reflection of the preferences of the constituents which only happens when people can actualize their preferences without limits on who their options are. Recognize also that a lot of the reasons that term limits exist are to prevent like endemic corruption or like long term like poor policy etcetera but insofar as these individuals need to get reelected over and over, there's a massive incentive not to mess up what you're doing or not to go against what your constituents elected you for because they simply will not re-elect you. This also eliminates the last hurrah effect that we often see where because like a certain congressman or certain senator knows that they have no more terms after that, they are way more likely to go out and do some radical policy that doesn't reflect what they were elected to vote on or what their constituents desire because they know that there's not going to be any kind of re-election and we think this is actually inherently democratic because antidemocratic because regardless of what party you're on regardless of like one particular politician's last hurrah being good or bad for you personally because like we think that it oftentimes what's been democrats doing a lot of good versus like doing a lot of good in like more moderate districts but we also think it could spin to like republicans doing really really awful things and more like democratic in more moderate districts of their own. So we don't think that that's what part of the conversation rather we think that like regardless of whether or not you personally agree or disagree with the policy, it's bad when that is the policy of the majority of a region and then their representative goes on not to do it because they don't have any consequences if they don't. And we think that's exactly the kind of world that term limits creates because it creates a situation in which there is no accountability, there's nothing that we can do about them going off on their own and so we think that it's bad. Our second area of clash is about how it's good for public public policy. Recognize that part of the reason for bureaucracy is that with congress people and elected officials are constantly rotated so it's really hard to pass consistent policy. This is especially true since every new person has an incentive to try something new and put some new policy out there because they want to distinguish themselves from their predecessors so there are actually no incentives to continue working on old legislature or if like someone left office right as like something was about to pass there's no incentive to continue pushing it if they were the main motivating force behind it. So we think that that's really bad. Without term limits we incentivize coalition building that allows bipartisan legislature into the long term because there's less of an incentive to show animosity when you plan on being there for awhile and you need to show long term growth to your constituents. We think that the incentive structure for what you accomplish fundamentally changes. In the status quo individuals are fine with showing short term growth because they know they're only going to be there for a short term so whether that short term growth is pissing off every single republican because you're a democrat and so your constituents are excited that you're taking hardline stances or whether it's passing really small stick policy none of that is actually impacted in the long term. Rather on our side of the house because you're going to be there for a really long time because you're worried about re-election for multiple multiple years you have to show that you can work with other people and show that you can provide long term good policy. The current system only allows the former and we think that's incredibly problematic. For these reasons, proud to propose.
A complicated system of taxation is far more likely to have legal loopholes, and ways in which the wealthy can avoid taxes, than one which is simple and flat. Because progressive taxation inherently requires complicated mechanisms, to ensure that the wealthy are paying more than the poor, we believe that we should end progressive taxation. The model and the alternative we will provide is that a flat tax will be put in place, where all individuals pay the same portion of their income to the federal government, rather than paying a progressive tax system, in which people who make less money, pay less money. We have two arguments to support this motion, first, we believe that simplicity is key. Evasion and loopholes in tax code occur because of complicated taxation. A flat tax, which says every single person pays the same amount, cannot be evaded. Recognize, that the evasion costs the government and the citizens by by extension billions of dollars each year. Further, the only individuals who can actually evade taxes are the wealthy. Although there are a variety of tax codes, which protect individuals and even provide relief for individuals who are poor, it is unlikely they will, first, be aware of those taxes, but second, be able to pay someone to actually complete their taxes for them. As such, evasion is only a tool for the wealthiest individuals, who should be paying the most tax money, because they get the most benefit out of society, and probably have a reciprocal obligation to all the people who buy their goods, and support them, and have made them into the wealthy person they are today. But finally, with a simple and flat tax, the what happens is that individuals can file their taxes themselves, and will largely not have to rely on the dead weight loss that occurs from tax filing. Accountants do not provide anything for the economy. We created an artificial demand, by creating a system so bureaucratically incompetent and complicated, that average individuals cannot solve it themselves. Individuals decide either to get lackluster tax returns, or pay someone, and essentially further expand this dead weight loss. A simple flat tax model will allow all individuals to file their taxes themselves, and ensure that all individuals pay a fair amount of their taxes. But the second argument, we'd like to make, is that this will be a better system, wherein we can better target the needs within society. Starting from the bottom, and changing the tax system, can lead to huge harms over all. We believe that individuals will have less of aversion to gaining money, in a system where we provide more benefits, rather than tax breaks to the poor. We believe that in the status quo, the marginal rate of taxation, where there are tears, as people make more money, disincentivizes individuals from pursuing higher paying jobs, which would create more burdens upon them. However, if we transfer the system from one which provides tax breaks for the poor, to provide greater social benefits for the poor, we increase the incentive for people to continue working. Although they might lose their social benefits, social benefits are inherently worse than money, given that they have less freedom to spend that money effectively, and more likely to be bound to spending that money on food and necessities. As such, people in poverty are more likely to work to actually improve their lot, rather than suffering from this marginal rate of taxation. If I can gain a thousand dollars of money I can use freely, but lose a thousand dollars with social benefits, I'm still more likely to go for that freedom, and as such the marginal rate of taxation decreases. But finally, we think that this leads to our control in customisation. It's hard to get the poorest people in society effective tax relief, and at the point we are charging them zero dollars in their tax money, it's difficult to provide them further tax breaks. As such, we would say that we should provide them direct social benefits, which we can target more effectively. They're far more likely to reach them, as they will not need to know complicated bureaucratic codes to access it. Thank you.
Abolish the american jobs act. The american jobs act consists of a series of proposals that would do things like increase the length of unemployment benefits, it would increase spending on things like infrastructure, schools, as well as give a massive amount of tax breaks that are incentivized around getting people to go back to work and to increase employment. So, recognize that in the status quo, the employment market in the united states is at its best that it has been since the recession. The unemployment rate is somewhere between four and five percent, which means that most americans that are looking for work are able to find work and as such, it is simply unnecessary to have this this type of massive market interference for a few reasons. Firstly, government spending crowds out private initiatives. What this means is that when you have spending from the government, it doesn't mean that private spending that otherwise would have gone to similar measures continues to go to those measures. What it means is that it holds back private investment, which means that if you have the government investing in things like jobs and infrastructure and things like that, if there were other projects that otherwise would have been going towards these ends, those projects get crowded out by the government, which means that the government ends up spending money that was otherwise wasteful. Secondly, recognize that this is essentially just a follow-up of the stimulus bill that followed the recession, a stimulus bill which in and of itself didn't work all that well. The stimulus bill didn't lead to any sort of massive recovery. It didn't lead to any sort of market confidence in the american economy. It put a lot of money into the economy. It may have stagnated the economy rather than letting it go into a spiral downwards, but this doesn't mean that it proposed some sort of massive solution. We don't think that it's worth, especially in this moment, spending the massive amount of money, the massive amount of tax breaks and outlays and expenditures that come with this bill in this moment, given that it is modeled after a previous bill which has shown to be ineffective. It's shown that it didn't do the good that it was intended to do. Thirdly, we would say that it's not the the government's job to interfere in free market enterprise, rather to maximize individual autonomy. What we mean by this is that the government doesn't exist to regulate the economy and to put people into individual roles and jobs and to designate how the economy is going to function. The government exists as a political body to ensure that people are able to freely interact with that market. That doesn't mean that the government is responsible for propping up that market when it's failing. It doesn't mean the government is responsible for giving people jobs in a free market. It means that the government is responsible for ensuring that if people want to get a job, they are legally and physically capable of going out and seeking that job, that there aren't restrictions put in place that make it impossible for them to interact with the market. This goes far beyond that measure. This goes from saying you have a negative right, a negative capability of going into that market, to a positive obligation of the government to spend money, to to put money out there to try and employ individuals. Some estimates say that up to two hundred thousand dollars per job created is being spent by this bill. We simply think that that outlet is not necessary, especially given the improving economic state of america in the status quo. We don't think that it's justified for the government to interact in the to the economic sphere, and we certainly don't think it's justified for the government to do so to the degree that the american jobs act requires it to do. We think that you should allow private market private market enterprise to to fully expand and to fully be able to regulate itself and for these reasons, we should abolish the american jobs act.
We should introduce year round schooling. Right now, in the united states at least, primary and secondary school students tend to have a large break in the summertime when traditionally you would have had lots of work on the farm for them to do. Most american students currently go to school for about thirty six weeks in the year. We propose a system wherein students go to school for twelve weeks with one week break afterwards which would have them go to school for forty eight weeks in the year. Three arguments for why this is better than what we have right now. The first is that this would better facilitate student's learning. During summer vacation students forget much of what they learned in the previous year. This is harmful for a few reasons. First of all, we tell you that students lose time at the beginning of the new school year reviewing material which they already have learned. If students go home for the summer and forget the names of the elements or great british authors or whatever they learned the previous year, and they have to relearn them in the fall, then this is time that isn't spent learning new material. On top of that we tell you that this facilitates learning because students are spending more time in the classroom. The only way for students to learn material is to be exposed to it in the first place. We tell you that by having forty eight weeks as opposed to thirty six of time with teachers the students will simply learn more material. It doesn't matter if you want students to learn more stem, or to be better informed citizens, no matter what you think education should be doing for students, it can be done better with more time with teachers, with more time to learn. And I'd also like to point out that particularly for low income students it's likely that they aren't using their time during the summer to better educate themselves. They might be working or they might just be in child care not really doing anything productive. So if students are in school year round it's likely that they are reading and doing experiments and other useful activities during the summer instead of playing with water guns with their friends which, while gratifying, probably doesn't do a great deal to prepare them for the work force or for college. Our second argument is about how this helps parents. Consider that if your children have a twelve week break in the summer you have to arrange childcare for that time. Whereas when your children are in school, they are in a safe, productive environment for free. During the summer you have to pay someone to look after your children if you work. We think that this places an undue burden on low income parents in particular. In other words, the families that can least afford to bear the cost of additional childcare are likely to be the ones in which both parents work. So not only are these families now being forced to pay for childcare, but this is a burden that accrues disproportionately to those worst off in society. We think that it would be far better to provide free childcare for those people. At that point when we already have their children, probably in a school being supervised, we might as well be teaching them. Moreover we think that these parents also are going to have their children on a system more like their own work schedule if their children go to school throughout the year. Parents can choose to take time off of work when their children have their short breaks which allows them to spend more quality time with their children. We tell you that at the end of the day this is better than having the children home for the summer without lots of time spent with their parents. Our last argument is that this would lead to a better use of resources. Consider that if children are at home during the summer, then schools are presumably sitting empty. We think that this is a waste of the resources that we've invested in those schools, not to use them year round. If we have to give them power and air and things like that, we might as well have children in them learning at the same time. And lastly we tell you that this is a misuse of teacher's time. That ultimately we would be better off having teachers spend more time teaching and less time working on other projects during the summer. While no doubt these are of value to the individual teachers, we think that having more face to face time with children would ultimately allow teachers to do their job more effectively and place less of a burden on them during that thirty six week period that they had before. For all these reasons we should introduce year round schooling. Thank you.
We should further exploit unconventional oil. So by this we mean things like shale oil, oil sands, tar sands. And by we in this debate we are going to talk about liberal democracies around the world, because much of the oil that exists in this format is in countries like the united states and canada. So three arguments for you. The first is about cheaper energy costs. We tell you that fundamentally there are two factors to the cost of energy: the supply and the demand, obviously. Now. The demand for energy is fairly inelastic. People need gasoline and heating oil and things like that, the same amount, year to year, regardless of how much is available. They can't just cut back freely, because it's so essential to our day to day lives. So at that point when you increase the supply, demand will remain the same and prices will fall. The effect of this is a better quality of life for your citizens, particularly those most low income citizens, who now free up a lot more of their money to spend on things besides gas for their car, and oil to heat their homes, and natural gas for their electricity. So we think that you actually help your citizens by driving down energy costs. Our next argument is about the political ramifications of exploiting unconventional oil. So firstly we think that you weaken two actors who are contrary to the interests of the international community. So opec, we tell you, is an oil cartel which exploits its position as having lots and lots of the world's easily extractable oil in order to prevent sanctions against member states, even when they're abusive, and require the US and other countries to support their interest abroad. We think that if you produce more oil in countries like the US and canada, then you're comparatively less dependent on countries like, say, saudi arabia and venezuela, dictatorships who we think we don't want to support and don't want to depend on as democratic countries. Sho you'll be more independent a very worst more reliant on the bulk countries like the US and canada. We also tell you that you weaken russia. Energy has been vladimir putin's main bargaining chip to keep the west from intervening in his adventurism in recent years. So if you consider why the west hasn't done more to help ukraine or to prevent putin from intervening it in syria, we think that a large part of that is that european countries rely on russia for natural gas and for oil, they're one of the world's largest producers. But if there is more oil available around the world then prices will fall, and it will be easier for the europeans to buy their energy elsewhere, and also the ruble as a currency will be less valuable which will make it more difficult for putin to run the country by buying off his people. The last political effect we see that you get is more domestic jobs in the USA and canada. These are countries that have faced a lot of outsourcing in the last few decades, so we think it would be good to bring lots more jobs, especially for kind of unskilled or uncollege educated workers, who might not have a lot of opportunities otherwise. Our last argument is that you need to develop this technology at some point. So recognize that we're running out of the kind of easy to drill oil that you see in countries like saudi arabia or kuwait right now. These reserves are drying up and are getting more and more expensive to extract from, which means that in order to meet our energy needs in the future we're going to have to rely on unconventional oil. So if we begin by developing the technology to extract that oil right now, while we still have cheap easy to extract oil, then it will be highly mature by the time that we rely on this for all of society to meet their needs. So at that point we think that everyone would be better off in the future if we develop this technology now. So for that reason we think we should further explore this type of exploit this type of oil. We think that the other team might get up here and say that by exploiting this oil you discourage investment in green energy or otherwise hurt the environment, but we don't see why this has to be zero sum. You could invest more in drilling for tar sands and things like that, and at the same time invest in wind power and solar power. Energy investment is not zero sum, and we think that it is better to be prepared for all contingencies by exploiting the oil that we have available while we allow alternative energies to mature, so that we're actually able to rely on them without seeing a lower standard of living in the future. Thank you.
The motion for today's debate is that we should ban algorithmic trading. What we mean by this is that we would no longer allow for companies or hedge funds or mutual funds, to use, or any kind of personal portfolio, to use algorithms that would say sell when the stock drops by ex percentage, or anything similar, to sell off large amounts of stock or manage each other's stock. Instead we would prefer for it to be done basically the way that we've done that up to this point, in which individual people decide when to sell stock based on trends that they interpret personally. Two main areas of clash: the first on the way in which algorithmic treating is prone to bugs and the impacts thereof. So here's a couple of examples: commonly in algorithmic trading you're taking an integer and your rounding it to a decimal. What happens then? Or you end up in situations where you have a negative interest rate, or maybe you just program something incorrectly, or maybe you just didn't test every kind of edge case, such as the situation in japan, where we all were like " oh, they're never going to put in place negative interest rates ", but joke's on you, that's exactly what they did. But since the algorithms never actually accounted for a moment in which negative interest rates would exist, there was no way for them to operate in that world and the ended up being completely wild. So we think that when these kinds of issues arise, and we think they're fairly common, it's the consumer first who owns that portfolio who gets kind of stuck and gets in trouble because of it. Because suddenly they are probably down large amounts of stock at little profit to like massive losses, and now this money that they put into it has essentially been wasted. But there's also this like larger impact in terms of big companies. Because recognize that when you're selling off tons and tons of stock at a time, what you're messing with is that is is the future of these companies and what they own. So like when people have pension pension funds that are bundled by large corporations, they lose them because those corporations fail. Or when you end up with like very large amounts of stock being sold off and it leads to shifts in the market, what happens then is that you scare investors away and they start pulling out. Because they're seeing that: " look the market is incredibly unstable. We don't know what's going to happen next. " And so rather than risking keeping their money in those areas, they start pulling it all out while they can still end up ahead. This is incredibly problematic insofar as it crashes companies. Because suddenly they don't have any of the stock left or not enough that is like actually bought. It makes their stock very very cheap when it's flooding the market, because everyone is selling it off. And this can also affect banks because a lot of banks are actually investing the money. And so we saw this happen in the great depression, when consumers got really really nervous and started pulling all their money out of banks, and that banks just didn't have all of that money. Because so much of it was invested. And what this essentially creating is a world in which governments have to try and bail this out. Unfortunately governments don't always have that money, and so we think that this is a world we ought not be risking. Our second independent point has to do with volatility. So a lot of, so let's like bring up another example: you have lots of companies that use the same general algorithm for when they sell their stock. AKA when the when the stock falls by ex percentage, that's when you sell. So one company has it at two percent another has it at three percent, so on and so forth. So the first company with the lowest barrier to sell sells it all off as soon as it hits below that barrier, because that's what the algorithm is programmed to do. This triggers the next one because when you sell a lot of stock you drop the price further, which would activate the next barrier. And as well as like leading to the flight response in which investors see this trend and say: " oh no. Like even if you're not using an algorithm you can't leave it there. " This cycle continues and essentially you end up destroying companies because the stock value becomes zero as more and more floods the market. This also has a more pernicious effect, because if the first mover is the one who wins the above described cycle, than everyone wants to be that first mover. It means you're going to have more and more algorithms that are setting you lower and lower barrier to sell, leading to an endless cycle in which there is never a stable company to invest in. For these reasons proud to propose.
We should subsidize higher education for two big reasons. First, we should subsidize it because it's very good for the economy overall and secondarily, we should subsidize it because, on the more individual level, it's also obviously economically good, but it's also very important for social mobility and individual empowerment. So, let's talk about what we mean by subsidizing higher education. Obviously, subsidizing higher education does not necessarily mean entirely free education. However, obviously, we are going to defend a world in which we substantially increase public subsidies for higher education, compared to the status quo. We also don't think that this necessarily has to be available to everyone. We think that we're we're perfectly comfortable in giving out greater subsidies in the forms of greater need-based aid, rather than just more general lowering of prices of education, and also increasing the extent and availability of public loans for education. Oftentimes in the status quo, public loans for higher education have much more generous terms of repayment and much more generous interest rates than private loans do, and but they're oftentimes not available to give as much money which fully covers the cost of public education. So that's another thing which we want to correct for. So, why is subsidizing higher education good for the economy? When you exist in a highly developed country, you predominately are going to see your economy be a service sector based economy or a more technologically focused based economy. And this creates a problem because it means that there's going to be a lack of a comparative lack of cheaper labor-based jobs or cheaper manufacturing-based jobs. This means that oftentimes the economy necessarily requires that most people have a higher degree of education, a higher extent of education for working in just like higher quality jobs. So this means that a necessary condition of your employment is oftentimes going to be getting a college education. And in the same way in which the reason why we fund low primary and secondary school is because those are necessary parts of your employment in a lot of cases. This is very similar for higher education so that makes sense too. So, we obviously don't want a whole bunch of people unemployed, because a whole bunch of people unemployed is lost productivity, and it's also just a drain on resources which isn't very good either. But additionally, this is also important because there's going to be when you don't have as much money that you're making, you're also just going to have less money that you're going to be able to pay for things. So, when you have a higher paying job work or if you're more educated, you're gonna make more money, and that means you're going to be able to consume more, which is also good for the economy. Additionally, and this also ties in to the feasibility point, we think that this is going to be a long-term investment that is going to pay off. And it's going to pay off because more and more people are going to once they're like better educated are they're able to work better jobs, they're able to innovate more, this is going to be better for the economy so this is going to cover the costs of the subsidizing more. But we additionally, in the short term, think that there is certainly available money for this. Maybe just spend less on the military and more on education and helping people. That sounds pretty good to me. So, the next thing that I want to talk about is about individual empowerment of people. And on the individual level, it is still often too difficult and too inaccessible to afford a college education. And this is particularly true given that college education around the world, but particularly in america, sees its expenses rising rapidly which prices out a whole lot of people, even people in the middle class. And this creates a big problem because it means that you're oftentimes, if you're not able to even afford college, you're locked into essentially the cycle of poverty, or you're not going to be able to have as engaging discussions or you're not gonna be able to have as like engaging an educated population as well, which means you're also more likely to have foolish political decisions like the election of donald trump, or denying climate change, or things like that. So it's very important on the individual level as well to make sure that people can go to college, to make sure that they're productive intelligent and beneficial citizens and so that they can be empowered to break out of the cycle of poverty. So for all of those reasons, we definitely think that you should subsidize higher education.
Prenatal diagnosis should be mandatory. So prenatal diagnoses are basically when doctors go in and examine the fetus while it's still in the mother's womb at various stages of development. In this way they can detect physiological problems with the fetus, such as for instance, if the baby is going to be born with a certain disorder, or if the fetus is going to be unable to brought to term and is ultimately going to result in a miscarriage, and I'm sure lots of other information that I don't know about, but that would be evident to doctors. So with that in mind we think that states should require that women undergo prenatal diagnosis. And we're going to say that these are harmless procedures that ultimately could be done at the same time as other routine health exams. So our first argument is that this leads to the maximum amount of information for doctors. If you are an OBGYN and you are making decisions about a patient's health, you need to actually have access to all of the information about that patients health. For instance if you don't know if someone is at risk of having a miscarriage, it's difficult to plan a course of treatment for that individual. We tell you that these prenatal diagnoses make it easier to know if someone is at risk of something like a miscarriage or is at risk of having a child who is not going to live after birth. With this in mind doctors can better advise their patients. We think that doctors have a moral obligation to provide the best information possible to their patients. This is true one, because they take an oath to do no harm and implicitly to do the maximum good for their patients, and two, because patients have little access to information and are dependent on doctors to give them good advice. We think therefore that the state would be justified in stepping in, in order to ensure that doctors are actually facilitated in offering this advice. Some people might not want these prenatal exams. We think that it should be mandatory anyway because doctors can't give them many forms of useful advice about their child and this information or the lack thereof would actually be harmful to the child if not provided. So we think it would be justified for the state to intervene in order to give doctors maximum information. Our second argument is that this allows us to assess the quality of life for the fetus. So for instance you may have a fetus that if brought to term would be born and possibly live a short period of time in tremendous agony, and at that point it's probably better to abort it before it reaches a later stage of development in order to maximize the quality of life. Or I suppose in this instance to minimize the poor quality of life. This is unfortunate but sometimes this is the case. We think that it's always better to have that information so we can make the most humane decision for the fetus, rather than to just let nature take its course. We don't live in the stone age anymore so there's no reason to treat people like we do. Not getting access to this information is ultimately condemning some individuals to live very short, very painful lives when that could be avoided overall. Our third argument is that this should be required because it's a low cost, high reward medical procedure. If you are a state government for instance, there's very little cost to requiring that a citizen go and get this kind of prenatal diagnosis. It probably only costs a few dollars in terms of an ultrasound. We tell you at that point that you're spending very little money on what amounts to a sort of preventative care to avoid problems down the line. And that doing this can save huge costs later on. For instance, if someone is going to need an expensive surgery, if nothing is done, but there is an ability to prevent it because we have access to this information, then you've just saved a huge amount of money for the public. Health care funds are normally not completely elastic. What that means is that if one patient consumes resources, there are fewer resources for other people. With that in mind, we think that government should always seek to use preventive care or to assess problems before they become serious so that they can spend more money on people who need immediate urgent care. With this in mind we think that prenatal diagnosis should be mandatory. Thank you.
Progressive tax is beneficial. When we're talking about a progressive tax what we mean is a taxation system from a federal government or some other government in which individuals are taxed at a certain rate based on their income or based on some other quantifier that goes up, given the amount of wealth or influence or whatever measure you're going to go by, that's the tax we're talking about when we're talking about progressive taxation we're specifically talking about a type of income tax in which higher income tax, or higher income individuals are taxed at a higher rate. So we think there are two reasons that progressive taxation is a beneficial form of taxation, and is better than a flat tax, which is another standard form of taxation. The first is that progressive taxes more fair, and the second is that a progressive tax allows for more revenue with which the government can do more for the public good. So firstly, why is a progressive tax fair? We think that the basis for taxation is that when individuals enter into a society, they give up certain rights in order to gain access to certain common and public goods. We think that when society gives out these goods, these are given based on the fact that individuals are taxed and they give up certain amounts of money, and they give up certain amounts of the product of their labor in order to gain those public goods, and in essence they're paying for those goods. We think that individuals that are of higher incomes have gained more from those public goods than other members of society. Now, what does this mean? Recognize that these public goods includes things like the infrastructure with which commerce can occur, the protection with which commerce can occur, and all the other aspects of a functioning market that allow for individuals to participate in the capitalist system and make money from what they have been make money from their labor. We think that this means that individuals that are able to gain more from this market essentially gained more from the existence of that market, and gain more from the system itself, but all individuals are need to pay into the system that allows for this market to occur. Given that individuals are paying into this market, we think that the individuals that gain the most from that market are also bear the burden of ensuring that the market exists, especially given that that market often excludes a vast majority of the population, for instance, income inequalities rampant across western states in the status quo, and this means that this capitalist system has left many people out, and we don't think that those people should be forced to bear the burden of what the what these taxes ultimately go for, which the infrastructure that allows these things to function. Now, this doesn't mean that individuals who are of lower class shouldn't pay into this pay into public works, because we think they also gain things outside of the economic boom that comes from the infrastructure that exists, but we think that they should be proportionate to what the individual has been gaining from that. So secondly, why do we think that a progressive tax is going to get you more revenue? We think that a flat tax rate means that individuals need to be taxed at a rate at which they can bear the burden of their taxation, which means you ultimately need to defer to the lowest tax bracket to determine how much of a tax rate they can bear in being able to live their lives but still pay the taxes that they get. We think that for higher classes this is definitionally a higher burden that they can bear, because they have more disposable disposable income with which they can pay their taxes. This means that if you have a progressive tax system, you can set appropriate rates for the burden that individuals can bear when taxing and when drawing from individuals' income, which means you can gain, on net, more money from a society and more money which you can do the public works. This means that you can do more good for the whole, which means that you can get more infrastructure, both for the lower and higher classes, but it also means that when these individuals pay more into the system it keeps the capitalist system going, which allows them to gain that money back in the long run, and because it's more fair and you can get more revenue for the public good, we think that you should prefer a progressive tax.
We should prohibit tower blocks. We think what this means in actuality and practice is that cities would ban construction of buildings above a certain height, would ensure that, especially in residential areas, these buildings can't be produced over, say, ten stories. We're not gonna set a limit, but we think that cities are able to do these things on their own in each individual case. Another principle is what's most important. So, firstly, we want to talk about we think the alternative to tower blocks is, what happens if you actually prohibit these things, why we think it's better for overall economic growth. So, in the status quo, when you allow things like tower blocks, where you're likely to get as populations that skyrocket in areas that otherwise geographically simply don't allow these things to happen. For example, in new york city, you're constrained by certain geological geographical things like water, types of boundaries, landscapes, things that don't allow you to easily develop in areas for people to grow and for a population to grow. But by allowing tower blocks, by allowing these buildings and residences, you're able to crowd many many more people onto the island of new york than you otherwise would be able to do if you didn't have these things. What this means is that population centers, as they currently are, are much higher than otherwise would be the case. We think it's likely to happen, given that there's already that because of a huge amount of factors, such as the fact that urban areas are more likely to have job opportunities for individuals, they're more likely to have educational opportunities, welfare opportunities, all these things that come with an abundance of resources available in urban areas. We think that's more likely to happen is that urban areas in very large places like chicago, los angeles, new york, these megalopolises, these areas would become a little bit smaller, would end up downsizing, but what's likely to happen is that people move to other less crowded urban areas, ones in which development, real estate and property is more widely available. What we think this means, in the long term, is that job opportunities are more geographically diverse. We think that, in the status quo, these urban areas end up accumulating almost exclusively in coastal regions. We think that these would begin to move inland as current urban areas were less likely to have available housing, and housing prices we think are likely to go incredibly high, go way, way up if you were to have this type of prohibition. So, the other reason why we think tower blocks are problematic, besides the fact that prohibiting them would lead to good ends, is that these buildings end up being incredibly high pollutants. These are high output buildings in the sense that you're cramming a huge amount of individuals into a very small geographic space. What this means is that the footprint of one of the the green footprint of one individual, in one small area, is massively multiplied and put upon the same region. Which means that you have overcrowded sewage systems, you have overcrowded landfills, you have a massive excess of waste in these areas in a way that otherwise just would not be possible for the same geographic area. Which means the natural environments of these areas becoming end up becoming comparatively more polluted than smaller urban areas or non-urban areas, and we think that there's other types of pollution as well, such as light pollution, such as noise pollution, that we think ruins the natural environment as it currently exists. We think that these things ultimately get cut down when you don't allow for tower blocks and you don't allow for the accumulation of huge amount of people per square foot in city areas. We also think, generally, that you get a more diverse spread of these types of pollutants, which means that any any excessive pollution would be spread more evenly throughout environments, which means that you end up having less individual degradation in these areas. Because of the environmental pollution that tower blocks cause and because prohibiting them would lead to better outcomes, we think that we should prohibit tower blocks.
The motion for today's debate is that we should abandon television. What we mean by this is that we would prefer if people used online streaming devices instead of like owning a television or buying bundles of channels. Two main areas of clash: first on television being obsolete. The way that television works is that it only provides certain channels, usually in bundles that people can purchase, with more expensive bundles containing more channels. But the problem with this is that even the smallest bundle is either not going to is not going to include all the channels that you want, while usually including quite a few that you don't need to watch. We think that, in comparison, streaming on the internet allows you to choose exactly what you want, either for free or much cheaper than what a TV would offer. So, already we're seeing what we're seeing is a more efficient system that is also less expensive and caters to an individual in a much better way, because maybe I'm only looking to watch bravo, but because I can only buy bravo if it is contained within a bundle of five other channels, one of which is fox news and the other of which is sports, then it is not like I have to pay for those extra channels even though I never use them. Already we're seeing that this is an obsolete system that computers and online streaming have already moved past. More than this, we think the problem with television it's not very diverse, and when you're using it you're not getting exposure to a lot of smaller artists or like minority figures. So, we think that because whenever you're in a certain country, your television is only going to stream the channels in the language and of that country, it's always going to be subpar to the compared internet where you can find online where you can where online streaming allows you to choose any language or any nationality or any group that you want to watch. So, like, my russian grandparents can't access the russian TV on their television because that's just not one of the options for bundles. But being exposed to streaming allows them to actively be able to choose what they want to watch, and it caters to their desires. We also think that it's good where online, smaller artists can break through much more easily because in order to be on television, you have to have those networking and, like, those connections in order and like the money to spend to end up on television. But anyone can make a youtube account and anyone can and a lot of like smaller artists can make contracts with netflix, where it's cheaper, and so you're actually going to be providing yourself with a more diverse group and more exposure to diverse groups. Our second area of clash has to do with why abandoning television provides more spending autonomy. We think that you end up in situations where you might find some channels to be problematic, channels such as fox that are very republican, channels such as stars that play very sexist shows and portray women in very negative ways, all of these you end up forced to support because they get bundled with other with other channels that you actually want. So you never actually get to make a decision about what corporations or what channels you want to support and which ones you want to send a message to. Other examples of similar situations might be that some channels are also much more expensive, and you're forced to stomach the cost of something like ESPN, which is much more expensive than most other channels, even though you are never going to watch it. It's still bundled in with the rest to spread out the cost. We want people to have more choice in what they are going to buy and be able to use their money more efficiently. The fact that someone is going to pay for ten channels and only watch two of them means that all the rest of the money is going to waste, and we think that it's better for the individual to be able to use that money elsewhere and only watch what they are actually going to use. For these reasons, proud to propose.
We should abolish needle exchange programs. Although well intentioned, needle exchange programs represent a misuse of funds, is giving money to individuals who have decided, of their own volition, to take illegal substances. Furthermore, it actualizes harms against the poor. Particularly individuals who in no way consented to be part of this transaction. As such we support the following motion: that all needle exchange programs will be banned and all cities which currently have needle exchanges will get rid of them. Two arguments: first is that it is a misuse of resources. All taxation is theft. It requires government power and behind it is the threat of jail time or other force. As such we need an incredibly high bar to use the wealth that we steal from citizens. The only just cash transfers occur when three conditions are met: first, the recipient isn't fully culpable. We would say that individuals who would use needle exchange programs are fully culpable for the harms that end up being actualized upon them. They decide not to buy safe needles. They decide to take the drugs. We would say that giving money to these individuals, or giving money to causes which support these individuals represents theft to theft which benefits individuals who in no way deserve the sort of money. The second standard is that the recipient can use the program to further their own wealth. This is why welfare is just, as it allows individuals who would otherwise not be able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps to actually get enough money to further their lot in life. To invest in human capital by investing in themselves. We would say that the needle exchange program doesn't do this. It simply is an excuse for drug addicts to get cheaper drugs, essentially, to cut the cost of using drugs substantially when they don't have to buy other needles. And it does not allow them to get themselves out of poverty as it most likely will entrench entrench the conditions of poverty as they get further and further addicted to drugs, as this program supports drug use. Now, the third standard is that is it is reciprocally beneficial. We would say that all welfare eventually trickles to all subsections subsections of society. Either through a variety of programs, or simply because poor people spend their money and that goes to the cashier who rings up at the store, goes to the person who provides the good and goes to the owner of the store at as well. We would say that needle exchange programs do not actually spread themselves out among society, and as such they represent a theft without any money coming back to the person from which this money was taken, which is an injustice in and of itself. We would say that any program which fails a single standard should not be adopted by the government, but this program fails all three. As such we would say that it is fundamentally unjust, and we would so that justness is an end in and of itself. It is the only way in which society can be held to its own standards and the only way which governments can be meaningfully critiqued. We would further say that it's going to be a political backlash as it doesn't fit the standards. As taxation being theft will likely create a conservative backlash against this sort of policy. The second argument is that this leads to ghettoization. We would say that the location will likely be in a poor neighborhood and attract a lot of drug addicts. We'd say that drug drug addicts will go to these places as it will cost less for them to take drugs as they don't spend money on needles, and they're unlikely to be highly policed, as they don't want to discourage drug addicts from going to these places. As such there will be an increase in crime in these areas as individuals are forced to live around more drug addicts overall. This means that poor people who did not commit any crime, who are not taking any illegal substance, will likely have massive harms against them as drug addicts steal their goods and also make the area less safe. Because we think this harms all sub sects of society, so proud to oppose.
We should ban telemarketing. By this we mean the practice of calling people on their personal phone in order to try to sell them some product or service. One of the defining traits of telemarketing is that it is unsolicited. These aren't people who asked to receive a phone call about a product. It's something that is a cold call, basically made to people who have never requested to receive that call. Our first argument for our side is that this is extremely intrusive. We would argue that people have the right to privacy in their homes. For instance, you aren't obligated to receive a solicitor at your front door and many neighborhoods or communities actually prevent solicitors from going door to door. This is why traveling vacuum salesman which were something of a feature of american culture in the mid twentieth century have largely gone away. But not only is this intrusive in the sense that we wouldn't allow this in a physical sphere but also because you can't escape from telemarketing. Now that everyone calls people on their cell phone as well as their home phone you can be at work or at any part of your life and still receive these very intrusive calls. And because people generally only receive calls either from people that they care about or some problem or something important they feel compelled to answer only to learn that their time has been wasted. We think that people ultimately have an a right to expectation of privacy not only in terms of their home which we see in the way that people can ban people from entering their home but also on their cell phone because this is an extension of their personal property. No one has positively consented to receive these calls and people have a reasonable expectation that their phone number not just be given out to anyone that wants it. So we think that ultimately this is violating people's natural expectation of privacy and therefore that the state ought step in and ban this telemarketing. Our second point is that telemarketing is predatory. I'd like to back up for a second. We think that the state should ban a practice when it has disproportionate harms to a certain community and we're going to argue that telemarketing has a disproportionate harm to the elderly. Many elderly people are easily taken advantage of by telemarketers. Indeed a lot of these companies target elderly people specifically. This is because for people who didn't grow up with telemarketing and who aren't as familiar with modern technology these people are much more easily confused or scammed by telemarketers. If they're told for instance your computer needs an update that costs thirty dollars you're not in as much of a position as a younger person who grew up with this technology to know that that's completely bogus and that actually their computer is fine and there's no way that this person could know that. At the same time if they receive a call threatening them and telling them that they no money even though they don't they're much more likely to feel pressured to give in because as an elderly person they're feel less able to defend themselves over the phone or don't realize that this is being used to take advantage of people. And we tell you that ultimately because many elderly people live on pensions or fixed incomes they can't afford to have these phone scams. And even quasi legitimate businesses often take advantage of the elderly such as by up selling them or giving them products that they don't need and you they use this telemarketing as one of their primary ways to find these gullible people that they can take advantage of. So we think that oftentimes telemarketing exists as a way to prey upon helpless elderly people because younger people would simply hang up the phone. So we think that there's a clear duty of the state to intervene because this group of people is being disproportionately harmed and also because there's a lack of information and education for elderly people about the risks of telemarketing and the harms that these people do. So we think there's a clear case for the government to step in and prevent this from happening. For all these reasons we should ban telemarketing. Thank you.
The motion for today's debate is that we should cancel pride parades. The model we're not saying that this is like a government thing, we think that the organizations themselves should choose to shut down the events that they're hosting and this would be like a preferable world. Three main areas of clash. First on why it puts a target in a much easier way than any other like everyday event. So recognize that the LGBTQ community is already at most risk to be targeted for a hate crime. We think that when you take those who are most marginalized and most likely to be attacked and place larger than normal quantities of them in a specific area at a specific time and label that as like a relatively peaceful area and a very like friendly and safe space, you're basically inviting someone who dislikes that group of people to come and put an end to this and make a really loud statement while doing so. We already see that many pride parades have attacks that occur at them like in israel it's very common for pride parades to be the focus of stabbings we've seen in the united states that pride parades have been targeted and so we think that this opens them up to attack that the organization should have to protect these people from, especially since so many who go to pride parades are young, they're oftentimes less inhibited, they're coming in from an area of not understanding necessarily how bad things can get or what their risk is. They just think they're going out to have fun and so that you end up with a false sense of security they think that they're in this safe space when in reality they're more dangerous they're like more in harm's way than they've ever been. And so even if you think that the organizers don't necessarily have an obligation to those who attend their parades, we definitely think they have an obligation to those who are especially young or especially uninhibited at these parades. But the second way in which there there is a target on pride parades is in terms of counter protests. We think that you're really likely to end up with gatherings of conservatives who are going to show up and try and show you why you are wrong about your beliefs and this oftentimes leads to a lot more potential violence, there's more much more likely to be conflict and verbal conflict between groups and all of this can be avoided if your event does not occur. Second area of clashe is why it's bad for public opinion because there are a lot of republican moderates who in theory are in favor of gay rights. They consider themselves egalitarian and they're like they consider themselves very forward thinking for republicans. However these people get really oppositional when they feel like that gayness is rubbed in their faces or when they feel like this is somehow being forced down their throats. So at the point that moderates get incredibly turned-off by like flamboyant expressions of LGBTQ culture or any kind of like BDSM mention, we don't think that the parade is worth the lack of political solvency that that comes afterwards. We think it's way more important to get good politics passed for LGBTQ individuals like marriage equality or getting better laws for LGBTQ youth or making it easier for LGBTQ youth who were who were affected by their parents or disowned by their parents to get emancipated things like that are infinitely more important than an evening of frolicking. Our third area of clash is why this puts undue power in organizers hands because you're having a million person operation run buy a few like maybe five, ten people and those people get to do a lot of things that are like unique to their power over the event. In the case of the recent pride we had I don't remember where but the recent one where they were able to ban jewish stars and call them zionist expressions we think that things like that occur only when you allow a few people in control of it. But the problem is that it's not as if those few people have to take responsibility for their action, rather the entire group gets blamed for what a few people did. We don't think that those people should have the ability to tarnish the name of a group of people as much as they do and so we think they should relinquish that power and cancel pride. For these reasons, proud to propose.
The motion for today's debate is that private universities should be banned. What we mean by this is that any universities that are currently private would either be disbanded or forced to go public in that they would be teaching government funding from government funding, and any kind of large donations coming in would also be split between all universities. Two main areas of clash, the first on education as a facilitative right. Because we tell you at the point that it is difficult for me to get a job or function within a society that fundamentally undervalues those and looks down upon those who either did not receive an education or come from lower classes and are less educated, then the then then necessarily education becomes a right by which I am able to access other rights. At the point that in order to access rights that everyone agrees on, such as the right to life, the right to freedom of speech, I first need to be educated. We tell you that it is also a fundamental right and ought be treated as such. But also, at the point that the type of education you get determines your future opportunities, for example, if I go to harvard as compared to someone who goes to a suny, it is easier for me to get a better job than that other person. We think this also makes it much more fundamental, to the point that everyone ought have equal access to it. As with any right, we think it's a problem when it isn't applied equally. We'd say that if I was taken into a room and shut the door and locked behind me, even though I can yell at the walls all I want, I'm still not being given my right to free speech equally, as compared to others, and we we would consider this a rights violation. We think it's a problem that the type of college I go to is vastly determined by income and my family name rather than my actual accomplishments or my ability to learn. We think it's even a worse problem when that college defines my opportunities and my future, because we don't think it's the case that harvard kids are just smarter, we think rather it's the case that harvard kids come from backgrounds that have more money, come from private schools that gave them better standardized testing prep, and have more opportunities when they get to harvard in the first place, because harvard gets more funding. So even though suny kids are just as intelligent, suny schools just don't have the money to offer the same level of professors, offer the same level of internships at other places, have the same networking with large corporations. This means there is a fundamental inequality of access. Our second main area of clash is so so basically what we're saying in this first part is that equalizing our options, by making sure that everyone goes into the same types of schools with the same funding, means equalizing the playing field into the long-term for these people when they look for jobs. Our second main area of clash is about how we make public universities better. We tell you that, now, the same large donors that were going to invest in harvard or yale, or any private universities that their grandchildren happen to go to, are going to invest the same money in the public funding in the public system. This money then gets displaced and actually allows public universities to get better with it. We also say that this decreases the fight for resources that currently occurs when the best professors, the best corporations, all go to private universities because of the name recognition rather than paying attention to state schools. When private universities don't exist, those professors have no choice but be hired by state schools, and those corporations have to network with state schools. Finally, when people graduate with a more equal playing field, we tell you it is no longer a competition within the job market to come from the biggest-name school. It means that I'm not getting arbitrarily shut out of a position because someone from harvard also happened to apply. We think that standardizing this against grades is also really important. At the point that I can be a straight a student coming from a public university and still get chosen below get get ranked below someone who came from harvard and had a much lower GPA, simply because they went to the school named harvard, is a problem insofar as insofar as there's no way to actually compare these different standards. Is the is the name worth more than the grade? We think it's preferable when everyone gets to go in the same kind of system. For these reasons, proud to propose.
John maynard keynes taught us that at times of financial lows, the smartest thing to do is to invest in invigorating and inducing the economy, even at the price of budget deficits and debt accumulation because this is going to be an investment that pays off very nicely in the long term. We are going to explain how fighting unemployment and creating new jobs benefits everyone and why this is going to pay off, especially to the rich. So, keynes observed the united states after the great depression and saw that the current neoclassic approach that the establishment is adopting of not intervening in the market isn't proving useful. What he found was that unemployment, when allowed to roam free, easily leads to more unemployment and to a continuous drop in growth. And the explanation is simple: when people become unemployed, they lose their purchasing power and they are forced to consume less. Thus, on an aggregate level, the demand for merchandise lowers and therefore, companies are forced to also lower the supply. For that, they need much less workers so they have no choice but to fire more workers, which, in turn, widens the circle of unemployment and so, we create a cycle that is quickly spinning to the bottom. The good news that keynes found was that the same multiplier effect also works symmetrically upwards. As soon as unemployment drops, the purchasing power goes up, people buy more, companies produce more so they hire more people and so on and so forth. The conclusion from all of this is that an initial investment of the state in creating jobs at the amount of ex is going to lead to a financial growth that is a few times bigger than ex, which allows for a quick return of the investment, therefore, it is a smart investment. Under keynes' influence, roosevelt came out with his new deal that has proven to be a huge success and saved the american economy from complete collapse. To tie it back to our motion, the american jobs act was meant to help the markets recover after the damage of the subprime crisis in the exact same manner that the new deal has before. Note that this is not only the poor that that are going to benefit from it, but also, and maybe even especially, the rich because everything is interconnected. So, even if they are now being taxed more than before, obviously, the the rise in growth affects the rich perhaps more than anyone else because once new jobs are formed, it is going to be their companies, it is going to be their factories that are going to enjoy this boost. This means that basically, when the when the rich are complaining that now they're going to be taxed more, they're essentially complaining on not being able to have their cake and eat it and we're not even discussing how unfair that is. We say something much more elementary. We say that it is simply unwise. Not intervening in the market seems like a great idea when everything goes well, but in times of financial lows, in times where recovery is needed, we must help the market step out of the shadow. Very proud to support the american jobs acts.
We should introduce year round schooling. We think that when it comes to education debates the focus of the debate should always be on what is most likely to result in good education for children, what is likely to lead to a more informed populace in the future, and what is most likely to be effective in actually achieving the goals of educating. So the model for this we think is pretty clear. We think that instead of having summer vacation, we would have school all for the entire year. We think that you're likely to increase we would probably increase the amount of school days that people have but we would also increase the amount of breaks that exist during the school year. So in the status quo in much of the united states there are like two large breaks during the school year. One for the spring, and one for the winter. We would increase these types of one week breaks but we would get rid of the three month layoff that exists during the summer. Alright so why do we think that this is so crucial? So the status quo has some very clear flaws. When we're talking about education, when you're talking about allowing people to really internalize what they're being taught in a classroom, we think that a three month gap every single year between class ending and class beginning is one that is likely going to result in the deterioration of skill. This is why in many schools the first month, or the first few weeks of class, result in people relearning what they learned in the past year. For example if you're going from algebra to geometry in high school, the first month of geometry may be composed of relearning the things that you learned the year before in algebra and the reason for this is that teachers and students alike both know that people simply forget the things that they've learned the year before. Once people pass the test and move on move move on with their life start, enjoying their summer, they're unlikely to actually remember the things that they learned in that class which means that school itself becomes a repetitive practice and it's also a massive time waste that otherwise could be used for teaching other subjects for continuing education. But more importantly, we don't think there's any sort of consistency to this type of education in the status quo. We think the way that people are most likely to learn to most likely internalize knowledge is to get a consistent learning pattern develop, to have some sort of study methods that they're able to consistently applied throughout the year but having hiatuses such as summer vacation, don't allow for these consistent patterns of education to emerge and we think that this leads to bad education habits and it leads to people always counting down to summer vacation. When people always have this one long break to look forward to they tend to turn off especially in the latter half of the school year when they know it's coming close. If you don't have these types of things we think you have more consistent patterns and what we've seen is success abroad where people have had these types of year round schooling. In nations that do have this type of schooling, their test scores tend to be higher than the test scores in places like the united states and other areas in which they have this very long lay off in the middle of the summer and we think that we think that arguments that go against this often involve the idea of children wanting to be able to take the time off. That there's this expectation that parents want to take their children on vacation and do this and that. But recognized if you give breaks during the year these types of things can still be done. Children can still get time to take their breaks but you actually also can spread the spread the lessons, spread the tasks out over a longer period of time which means that we think that students while they're in school, are less likely to have the same levels of stress, the same levels of anxiety, and the same pressure upon them as they would when the school year shortened and teachers are forced to cram entire entire courses into a shorter period of time into a shorter period of time and trying to get it all in before they lose the attention of their students who are always looking on to the prospect of summer. We think that year round schooling has been shown in past instances to be successful. It is shown to allow for better education patterns, and habits to form in students and we think that simply sticking to the old way of doing things because people are comfortable with it is never sufficient excuse. We think that year round schooling is likely to result in more educated students, in a more educated populace, and for this reason, we should introduce year round schooling.
We should subsidize higher education, and the standard that we're going to set this round is that in countries which currently subsidize secondary and primary education we think that higher education should be treated in the same way. So for instance, in a country like the united states or canada, where secondary education is completely free at the point of use and no one pays money to attend public high schools, we think no one should pay any money to pay public colleges as well. So we would have the state completely fund tuition at public universities. So this wouldn't include private institutions like harvard, it would be more for public institutions like say the university of michigan, and schools like that. So with this in mind we have three arguments. First is the idea of education as a right. Presumably, countries that already provide secondary education free of charge recognize that people have a fundamental right to education. We think it is arbitrary for there to be a line in the sand at age eighteen that says before this point you have a right to education, and afterwards you do not. We think that people have a right to learn the skills they need to succeed in life, and that this is why we educate in the first place. On top of that, we tell you that education as a right was established in many countries in the early twentieth century when primary schools became free, but over time the educational expectations for citizens have changed. A secondary education used to be a really high level of education in nineteen hundred, but today it's seen as normal in most countries. So we think that a similarly high bar would actually be to provide tertiary education to people, and therefore in order to be consistent with the original goals of the secondary education movement, we should also provide free at point of use higher education as well. And on top of that, if individuals such as children have a right to be educated, you could only facilitate that through the education of others. You need teachers, you need informed parents in order to best educate the next generation, and we think that you can only access that if people are able to go to college, and obviously many more people can go and get a university or college education if it is subsidized the same way that secondary school is. Our second point is about the economic impacts of this policy. Now, it's absolutely true that in the short term, government spending will go up. I think that when bernie sanders ran for president he said it would cost a few tens of billions of dollars to pay for this in the short term in the united states, so probably less in smaller countries. We tell you, however, that workers will earn more because they'll be able to be more productive and they'll be more specialized. We tell you that people who are more educated are able to use different techniques to achieve more in the workplace and also that their higher education allows them to fill jobs that otherwise would go empty. So they can specialize more, and the economy is ultimately much better off. We tell you that as these people earn more because they're being more productive, the economy will also grow. They are earning more because the economy as a whole is getting larger and they're contributing more to it. This means that more people will pay taxes, people who would, in the status quo, not be working, or not be able to produce very much, so they would actually be receiving money back instead of giving money, would now be paying in taxes, and on top of that, there would be more prosperity for all. People who cannot work, such as the elderly, children, people who are pregnant for instance, would all actually receive a higher quality of life if the society as a whole is more prosperous and more people are paying in money than there is a greater amount of wealth to share around for everyone in need, so those people would be better off as well. We think that for this reason even the people who don't go to college will be better off because their social safety net will be better. With this in mind, investing in highly subsidized higher education seems like an excellent investment. We think that the return in terms of economic growth will be greater than almost any other investment that a government could make. Our last argument is about the social impact of this highly subsidized education. We think that people who go to university are better able to be informed voters because they have a better understanding of the history that surrounds events, and also things like critical reading and critical writing, and in general have more access to information than people with only a secondary education. We therefore think that they will make more intelligent decisions when they vote, so we'll have better government. We also think that they're likely to be better citizens because we can encourage more civic education, and because they'll be better able to appreciate the importance of their civic duties. Because of this, we think that ultimately everyone will be better off in society. And lastly, we think that you'll have a more equal society if you offer this type of free education, because even low income or disempowered people will be more able to access higher education now, so at the end of the day this will be less of a privilege of the elite and more accessible to everybody. For these reasons, I am proud to suggest that we should subsidize higher education.
We should limit the right to asylum. So in this debate, we're not going to say that countries should stop offering asylum completely, but rather that they should be extremely discerning in who is granted asylum. A few reasons why this should be the case. First, there's a tremendous cost to society of having the right to asylum. Most often, people who come to a country for asylum don't have the means to support themselves. Instead, they rely on some form of public largesse to support themselves until they're established. So at that point, you have people receiving benefits from the state who have never paid in in the form of taxes, and who are not currently producing anything for society. While it's true that some of these people might be great thinkers or scientists, as we saw from people fleeing germany in the second world war, many others are likely to be unskilled people who are just the victims of circumstances in their home countries, such as many of the syrian refugees. We think that in order for states to continue to provide for their own people, which must be their first and foremost concern, they need to limit the right to asylum. Our second argument is that if you don't limit the right to asylum, then people will take advantage of it in ways that we don't intend. Right now, it's very difficult for most people to immigrate to a country like the united states, while it's relatively easy to gain asylum, by comparison. We think that if it is easier to gain asylum than to go through immigration channels that more people who are actually immigrants will seek to have themselves labeled as asylum seekers. As an example of this, consider how many of the syrian refugees have, rather than staying in greece or eastern europe, pressed on to germany, because they want to live in a wealthier, more powerful country rather than merely stay in the first country that can offer them asylum. We think that this is unfair to two groups: one, citizens of these countries who now have these people coming in, who have limited skills and limited ability to contribute to the economy, and two, legitimate immigrants, who are now effectively sent to the back of the line, behind these asylum seekers. Many people have been on waiting lists for immigration for years and years, and now are unable to move to the country that they worked so hard to get into because asylum seekers are taking their spaces. We think that this is grossly unfair to those groups. And lastly, we would argue that we should limit the right to asylum in order to preserve it in the long term. In other words, if there continues to be huge potential for abuse with the right to asylum, then more and more countries are going to get rid of this right entirely. We think that it would be preferable for countries instead to limit the right to asylum. That's the comparative in this debate, it's not the continued status quo, where countries are relatively generous with access to asylum. It is a world in which right-wing politicians, especially populists like donald trump or marine le pen, are able to use the threat of people coming in to take jobs or to work as a tool to become elected, and then to crackdown on issuing asylum at all. So if you think that it's important that people have access to this right when they need it, such as victims of the syrian civil war, then you need to promote a more conservative use of this right to asylum. Offering it to too many people will undermine political support from even the most generous populaces. At this point, we tell you that the right to asylum needs to be limited in order to protect the citizens of the country where these asylum seekers would go on to live, in order to protect the people who are trying to come into the country legally through other forms of immigration, and on top of that, in order to protect the right to asylum in the wrong term long term. So for these reasons, we should limit the right of asylum. Thank you.
We should limit the use of birth control. In this round we want to make our model clear. We think that as a society we should try to abstain from using birth control of all forms whether it's the pill, whether it's a condom, whether it's other types of birth control all acts, all types. We want to limit access legally to those who are over eighteen unless they have the permission of their parent to have birth control and we think it would be better as a general norm that people did not use birth control as frequently. So this may sound counterintuitive, but we're going to make two broad arguments. The first is that you have a less sexualized culture and we're going to explain why that's better, and second, we're going to talk about more parental control. So we think generally this motion is largely impacting those that are of younger ages because when people are older they have the ability to make these choices largely for themselves because of the way we've set up the model but we think that young people today growing up are growing up in a hyper-sexual culture one in which there's huge pressures to have sex. We think it's very difficult to internalize the emotional impact of that action as a young person. Many people who are growing up in this culture don't understand that being in a sexual relationship, being vulnerable in that sexual relationship, having a healthy sexual relationship, how difficult these things are and how they can be emotionally and mentally draining and how in bad scenarios people can end up in really bad emotional and mental states. We think it's better to check against the potential of long term long term sexual emotional issues and suspend that pressure as much as possible. By limiting the access to birth control, we think you deter the amount of people that are ultimately going to try and have sex. We think that when you have fewer people having sex, you end up having a less sexualized culture because if fewer people are sexually active, that's fewer people in places like high schools, in places like in extracurriculars that young people are involved, we think that they're less likely to be talking about their sexual relationships to be putting implicit pressure on others to be involved in a sexual relationship because simply there's going to be fewer people that can have safe sex. Some may say that this is going to lead to more unprotected sex but we think that in the status quo, there are already plenty of people that have that and there's plenty deterrence against that because because of the impacts of a potential unwanted pregnancy. So we think that you're more likely to have a larger decrease in people that are creating the sexualized culture than you are people resulting in unwanted pregnancies. Secondly more parental control. We think that parents are the most informed people about their children. They almost always have the best interest of their child in mind because of that close connection that one has as a parent to a child. Parents know if their children are ready for a sexual relationship and we think legally limiting the use of birth control to people that are over eighteen is preferable because it means that you're setting this bar at which people generally are able to make safe choices, are able to make responsible choices but below that age, we think it's questionable whether someone really is able to consent into a sexual relationship, to fully understand what that means. But parents are those that are probably most likely to understand whether or not a child is ready for that and while it may be difficult to talk to your parents about sex, we think it's better to be doing that than to try and run around behind one's parent's back and make decisions that a person is going to regret in the future. There's no clear right to birth control. There's no clear right to have as much protected sex you want. But we think what parents do have is a right to raise their child in the way that they see fit, to raise their child with a moral with a moral life and a moral upbringing in the way that they see best and for these reasons, we should limit the use of birth control.
The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish standardized testing. Two many areas of clash: the first is why we think that standardized testing unfairly benefits those who are already privileged. Standardized testing is a skills game that can essentially be taught if you're willing to put enough time and more importantly, money, into it. There're entire books full of tactics, such as process of elimination or other ways in which you game the test in order to get the highest score. The problem with this is that it isn't a test of your intelligence or your ability to study or any of the other skills that you were actually need, once you get accepted to university, but rather just a test of how well you can memorize the tips and tricks given to you by your tutor. However, if I cannot afford that tutor in the first place, I'm certainly going to do worse on the SATs than other people who did have access to the tutor because their parents were wealthier. What this means is that the SATs and other standardized tests skew who gets into universities even more in favor of wealthy and typically white school children. The amount of money that you make shouldn't define your future, and we think that's what standardized testing represents because, of course, there are always going to be inequalities that favor those who are richer on both sides of the house. But putting so much pressure on one test that is exclusively available to those who are more wealthy, unlike, let's say, extracurriculars, which maybe you will be able to have more access to it if you don't also have to work a job, but at least it is available to you regardless of that status. We tell you that tutoring and other such things are not available to you regardless of the kind of effort that you're willing to put in, because it is exclusively based on the amount of money you have. We think that you shouldn't allow this to exist as well. Without standardized tests, we think that you even the playing field and allow it to be more leveled, because you can let recommendations and extracurriculars and participation in class matter a lot more. Currently, the divide of power that standardized tests have over your future is too much and favors the privilege in a much too great of a way. We think that our side of the house greatly decreases this and allows the displacement of power to occur across more holistic methods of of looking into children. Are second area of clash has to do with why it places too much pressure on non-holistic skills. We think that testing is a bad metric. You're not going to use these standardized testing skills in college. It is much more important that you are able to communicate with your peers and your teachers and have strong study skills. But these aren't the skills that are measured by a test, so why should it be worth over fifty percent of your chances of getting in? We think that it is that by overemphasizing standardized test, you are sending the wrong message to children. Telling them that if you can get these skills down just to pass this one test, you are going to be able to succeed in the rest of your life is incorrect, and unless you change the way that you appraise children for college, you're not going to be able to change the message you send. Finally, a third area of clash. Anxiety and depression and other mental illnesses are rising in the younger population, and the rise is largely attributed to standardized testing. When you have to put so much effort and so much stress onto one test, and you have all this pressure because it can count for so much of your future, this causes a lot of undue anxiety in children who are much too young to handle it. We think that this can lead to long-term problems and difficulty with handling things like stress, and we don't think that this should be what happens. It is unnecessary and thus, should not be risking the health of our children. Recognize that things like anxiety and depression can also manifest in physical symptoms, such as heart palpitations and increased risk for heart attacks in the future, and we just don't understand why it is happening. At the point that these tests are unholistic, at the point that they aren't actually what you need in order to better yourself in your future, and at the point of they're unfairly privileging those who are better those who have more money, why do they still exist? For these reasons, proud to propose.
We should introduce recall elections. So, to begin, we're going to give a model of how we think this would look, and then we're going to explain the principle that this is based on, before explaining how the pragmatic benefits would accumulate, if we introduced recall elections. Okay, so, we think that recall elections are generally going to take place at the state level, we don't think that it is feasible to have a national recall election, but at least at the state level, we think it would be initiated via a petition of twenty percent of registered voters in the area of the representative. So, what this means is that if some state if constituents of that person want to recall them, they would need to get a petition of twenty percent of the population that is registered to vote. Which means that, if you're child, you couldn't sign this petition, if you're not registered to vote you couldn't sign this petition, and this is so that you ensure that those that have a stake in the election are those that can have a stake in the recall. Okay, so we think that the principle behind this is very simple: we think that democracy, while it is certainly flawed, is the best way to aggregate the preferences of the people. We think that term lengths are, in and of themselves, arbitrary, and that allowing recall elections, allows for people not to be bound by these terms lengths. We think that this is incredibly important, because oftentimes these term lengths ensure that individuals that become incredibly unpopular, elected officials with approval ratings below thirty percent, below forty percent, people that simply don't have the trust of the public, continue to stay in office. We think that this is problematic, and while in some instances, we think that there may be a misuse of judgment, by those that are recalling the person, in the vast majority of instances, we think when people would be recalled, these are legitimate instances, in which that person is failing in their role as a as a representative of the people, because they no longer represent the popular will of those that elected them. So, we think that there are some massive pragmatic gains that come from this, in instances where there could be a recall. First, we think that there are instances in which elected officials are corrupt, and what this means is that when you recall these people, you ensure that you're moving corrupt officials from office, and these are often instances in which there isn't enough evidence that this person would go to jail, or a legal process would be much longer than a recall process. We think that recall can ensure that corrupt officials are removed from office, which is crucial to avoid an abuse of power. We also think that the potential of recall always holds elected officials to the fire. Means that, you know that you're not safe, and you're not bound to your term, but rather if you are doing a poor job, if you're acting in a way in which individuals, that you are representing, do not approve of what you're doing, you can be removed from office. And this is important, because oftentimes elected officials will behave in ways that go against their constituents, but because the the public memory is a very short term thing, what this results is people shifting their position, once an election becomes closer, and these individuals end up winning reelection. But, we think that this only involves a cycle of abuse, in which people are able to abuse the fact, that the public is not able to be constantly vigilant, and constantly aware, and they're not able to recall. What this means is that, if you have recall elections for the entirety of the term, people are more likely to be representative of their constituents, rather than them shifting to be representative when it comes time to have an election again. We simply think that a direct democracy leads to a more satisfied constituency, it leads to a voting body that is more likely to be happy with the actions of their elected officials, and it ensures that in those cases, in which those elected officials have clearly failed to represent their people, the people that voted them into office, we think that recall elections are invaluable tool. And for these reasons, we should introduce recall elections.
We should have recall elections, because they're incredibly important for ensuring accountability of our politicians. And I think, the first reason, why they're important for ensuring accountability, is because it makes sure that politicians can't just lie and get away with it. Politicians tend to promise a lot of things on the campaign trail, they promise that they'll fix your problems, that they'll get rid of your enemies, and all these kinds of things. Most of the time, they don't actually do that. And, while we expect that politicians can't possibly do everything that they ask, sometimes politicians can do the opposite of what they say, or they can just directly violate and break their promises, which is very obviously bad, because people vote politicians into office under the expectation, that they're going to do the things, like that they vote for them to do. So, if politicians don't do that, if they change on some issues, then people should have the right to reevaluate if they still want this politician to be in a position of power. And, without the ability for people to actually check politicians this way, there's no reason why they can't just say one thing on the campaign trail, and then completely change their mind. But, the second way, in which I think that this ensures accountability, is because otherwise accountability is going to be, as far as like impeachment, or condemnation, or censoring, or silencing, or whatever, that's going to fall on people's peers, the politicians peers, rather than on the people itself, and that's a big problem. So, for example, when you look at like impeachment trials in america, they are like one of the most partisan things ever. Donald trump possibly deserves to get impeached over the, like, russia thing, but it's probably not going to happen, unless he did something super super egregious, because there's partisanship at place, it looks bad for the party, if the if a member of that party in a position of power gets kicked out of office. However, the people don't have the same kind of loyalty to the individual. They may have loyalties to the party as a whole, but they don't have the same kind of account loyalty to the single individuals, in the same way that their peers do, or possibly dependent on these people for support , or have to work with them, or things like that. So, by introducing recall elections, you take the power away from their peers, and you give it back to the people, which, besides just being the more democratic option, is much much better, as far as actually enforcing good practices as well. But, the final thing that I want to talk about is recall the debate shouldn't be about what the benefits of recall election are, really the debate should be about it should be about what grounds, under which shouldn't we have recall elections, rather than should, because I think that recall elections are a right that we have, and the presumption should be in favor of that. And, I think that this is because people in positions of power, in a democratic society, do not have any kind of right to that position. They have that authority, purely based on the fact that people think that they are worthy of representing their opinions, because people cannot like people have lives to live, they can't just like vote on everything, and be involved in politics on a full time basis. So, people give, in a very profound way, control over their lives over to these politicians and these politicians have a lot of power. People should be able to take away that power, within reason, whenever they want. And, for all those reasons, I am very proud to say that we should introduce recall elections.
We should abolish standardized testing, because people learn in different ways. It is a waste of time and it is a waste of money. So, first, why do we think that standardized testing is a problem for different kinds of learners. Obviously there are good testers and there are bad testers. The problem with this, is that good testers are oftentimes not actually learning really anything from the process of taking these tests themselves, and the test doesn't even provide a whole lot of value to them. Just because you're able to memorize a whole bunch of facts, you are able to figure things out on a test, doesn't mean that there's actually any real indication or proof that you've learned anything, or that you're actually prepared to engage with the real world. However, on the flip side of this there's also obviously bad test takers, and just because somebody isn't necessarily good at taking a test, doesn't mean that they haven't learned skills that can be applied in some way, and it doesn't mean that they're prepared to move on to the next ring, or other things like that, and it certainly doesn't mean that these people have any less degree of intelligence than people that are good test takers. But additionally, we also think that standardized testing is a waste of time. Because recognize that when you have a standardized test, it doesn't allow for the specialization that comes with individual classes that people are taking. So for example, when I was growing up in florida, I was required to take the florida comprehensive assessment test or the FCATs. And I would have to learn about and I would my teachers would be forced to spend weeks teaching to this test, and this would happen regardless of what level of the class you're taking, so if you're taking more advanced classes you could be having to waste weeks on end making sure to reviewing this basic material, so that way these tests are still going to be passable for students. And on the flip side, if students are maybe not prepared necessarily to be taking these tests and should be taking other classes for that, this is necessarily a good uses of time as well. But in addition to it not being applicable to skill level, we don't necessarily think that it's controlled very well for content areas either, because oftentimes the concepts that are covered on these tests are rather basic concepts, rather broad concepts, concepts that can't necessarily be applied to a whole lot of things, and things that are ultimately not all that important to actually learn about or know about anyway. But the final thing that I want to talk about is about how this is a waste of time. And the reason I think sorry, that this is a waste of money. And I think that it's very important to talk about money and its relation to this, because keep in mind that there's an opportunity cost with education spending, and that every dollar that is spent administering standardized test is money that could actually be spent on making schools better, it's it's money that could be spent on better textbooks, on paying teachers more. And this is especially important given that oftentimes education budgets are among the first things that get slashed by governments in times of recessions or hardships. So why do we think that standardized tests are a waste of money. Because I think that the costs that come with them are oftentimes quite high. For example, you need to make sure that you pay for all of the booklets and all the scantrons that get used. Oftentimes these things are costly in and of itself since you need millions of them. You also need machines to read the tests, and you need also proctors or graders to administer the test and look over tests and grade tests, you have to pay for the hours of those people. You have to administer trainings for people so they are prepared to teach how to teach to the test. And you also have to provide money to question researchers, question triers, things like that as well. All of those costs can eventually stack up and pile up, and they could be all of that money, each dollar of that money could be used anywhere else. And it is for all of those reasons that we are incredibly that I'm incredibly proud to propose that we abolish standardized testing.
We should disband asean because it is wildly ineffective and because its very existence precludes more attractive alternatives for international relations that would exist like direct bilateral negotiations or regional multilateral negotiations. So let's start by talking about the fact that it's grossly inefficient and ineffective. And this is crucial because if it's shown that asean doesn't actually do anything, it can't actually get anything done that it might as well be disbanded because it's not really doing anything by its existence and I think that this is very likely the case, and the reason for that is because it's very difficult to find a consensus on issues. It's rather foolish to look at southeast asia as just this like unified block that doesn't have disagreements because they have drastically different cultures, they have drastically different languages oftentimes, different religions, different socio economic situations, different social priorities, there's all different kinds of policies. So it's likely very difficult on any kind of whether it's security, international dimension, policies, economic priorities in trade, all of these things are are just a quagmire and therefore it's probably difficult to get a unanimous opinion on anything. So you're probably not actually losing anything by this. So I think that that's very important because this ineffectiveness ultimately crowds out a more effective avenue and that is direct bilateral negotiations. So I think that direct bilateral negotiations between these countries as opposed to trying to just work through this one big block is going to be better for three big reasons. The first reason why it's going to be better is because these deals are necessarily going to be smaller in scope. So rather than just trying to have like just one group which is going to try to govern over everything, you can make individual agreements on specific matters of agreement. So it's going to be much more precise. So people are going to be much more likely able to like work out things and then take concrete action in it rather than these things just getting lost in like a bigger type of plan. Secondarily I think these things are just going to be faster. When in addition to being smaller in scope when you're also only going to have two actors, all of this is going to make negotiations faster. It makes decision making faster for enforcement. It makes like response times of various things faster, and all of that is very important because a deal is great but if the deal is ultimately not executable because you can't ever agree on how to carry out various terms of it then you're not really getting a deal there. So you're much more likely able to actually achieve that when you have these bilateral negotiations. And finally, I think that these are just going to be more active. They're going to be stronger because I think that generally when someone wants to take a bold position on something or like a bolder social policy, a bolder intervention, a bolder kind of action, these generally are the ones that are uniquely difficult to actually have unanimous opinion for and this is important because sometimes these actions are necessary to be taken for some countries. Sometimes it's a drastic economic policy because of it and maybe some countries it's necessary for them but you can't get everyone to agree on it. This is important because when you're having a smaller group of people you can get the most concerned parties to actually act on it. So now you're going to actually be able to get more help legislation not just not just more precise and faster but also stronger legislation stronger action more necessary action and it is for all of those reasons that I think that we should disband asean.
We should abolish zoos. So in this debate we're not talking about conservation parks or places that exist solely for the benefit and rehabilitation of animals, we're talking about zoos that exist pretty much exclusively for the entertainment of people who visit them. I have in mind the bronx zoo, but there are obviously thousands of zoos like this around the world. So three arguments for why we should abolish these zoos: first is that we think they are fundamentally cruel to the animals which they house. In nature, animals would always have access to much more space to roam around then they will in a zoo. Even some of the largest zoos, like the one in san diego, or the one in north carolina, still cannot provide animals with the type of habitat that they would have in nature. An elephant that would normally roam over tens of thousands of acres might be limited to a few hundred acres in the best zoo. In smaller urban zoos, we tell you that it's likely that they're limited to one or two acres. This is similar to keeping people in prison. In the same way that we see that it is a punishment to prevent people from moving around, we think that these animals are also arbitrarily being punished by being denied access to the space they would normally have to provide themselves with a high quality of life. We think it's unlikely that these animals are able to self actualize when they're confined to a tiny area like a zoo. But on top of that, we think it's cruel because it denies the animals the ability to socialize naturally. In nature animals likely meet dozens of other members of their own species or at the very least have more choice about how they socialize. Whereas in a zoo, perhaps they're kept with other members of their species, or perhaps they're kept in isolation. Which seems like a tremendous amount of torture given that it is illegal to keep people in isolation without any good reason. At that point we think that zoos are ultimately harmful for the mental and physical well being of the animals that they house, that they are cruel, and that it is not just to torment other creatures for the enjoyment of humans. Therefore we should abolish zoos. Our second argument is that zoos provide poor education to the people who visit them. The argument that I anticipate the other side making will be that zoos raise awareness of issues like conservation. But we think zoos actually build what we'll call false consciousness about these issues. People go to the zoo and think that donating money to the zoo, for instance, is a good way to prevent species from going extinct or to help conservation. But it doesn't really follow to me that giving money to a zoo in new york city does a lot to help out elephants in africa. It seems more likely that things like conservation parks, national geographic specials television programs etcetera, could all do a better job of raising an money for conservation without the huge overhead of running a giant zoo. We just don't think that this is a good way to educate people in terms of our use of resources. And also people don't always take away good messages from zoos. They devalue and commodify animals in a way that makes them seem like cheap sources of entertainment for people rather than beings deserving of respect. Our third and final point is that we think zoos are a poor use of funds. Recognize that many zoos are funded by the public. We think that this is inexcusable. First of all, zoos don't actually do a lot to promote conservation. So if you think that the government needs to spend money on conservation, this is a bad way to do it. We don't see that the government subsidizes other forms of entertainment in this way, so we also don't think that you can win this debate on those grounds. But moreover, any money spent on zoos is not money spent on helping people. We think that if you care about things like education and people's well being, that you should spend money on schools rather than zoos. These institutions cost millions of dollars to run, often don't break a profit, and don't seem to be a good investment for municipal or state governments. So for these reasons we should abolish zoos. Thank you.
Surrogacy should be banned. When a woman gets pregnant it's one of the most dramatic things that her body can undergo in her entire life, impacting her hormones, her ability to sleep, her ability to eat, the medicine that she takes, her ability to work and almost every factor of her life during that time, and it only gets more dramatic pregnancy goes on. I think that this is dramatically coercive system in which women are paid to bear children, without entirely knowing the risks that they can take on, and once they do, having no ability to opt out of this system because they cannot abort the child nor can they reverse the fact that they're pregnant. So this is what I'm going to talk about: why the systems are so coercive and why in this instance the government should step in and ban surrogacy contracts. So, why is this unique from any other system that is coercive on individuals? We think that individuals should not be able to give away their autonomy or their bodily autonomy into the future. We don't think that individuals are good at understanding that , understanding the impacts of their present actions on their future self and the amount of pain or pleasure that their actions may have on them in the future which is why we don't think that people should be able to have contracts that sell themselves into slavery no matter how desperate they may be for money. It's because there's no way to undo something once you've given up your ability to choose for yourself or to have your own bodily autonomy and therefore those contracts can't be outdone undone. Unlike say, if you accept a job, you're able to undo the fact that you accepted a job you don't like or one that doesn't fulfill what you need in your life by simply quitting the job. It might be something that you don't want to do, but unlike a pregnancy which is what happens under surrogacy contracts, there's no way to reverse that other than breaking the contract in a way that harms the fetus and harms the people that were relying on you once you had that child. More importantly, we think that these contracts often target the most underprivileged women. Women that otherwise wouldn't be able to feed themselves, feed their families, keep them keep a roof over their heads. People that are most desperate society are the ones that are most likely to take these contracts because one, they're often the most misinformed about what actually happens during pregnancy or what might happen to one's body, what the cost of that might be long term after even after the pregnancy is done, and two, they're the group most likely to accept this sort of drastic action in favor of getting this money. We think that this is an especially coercive system that is simply a means for people to utilize women who are in the lower classes in order to avoid having a pregnancy themselves, or in some cases allowing a person to arr, allowing a gay couple or a lesbian couple to adopt. Now, that is something that's important is that these people should also be able to have children , for themselves. The issue here is that we think that perfectly viable options such as adoption exist that allow people to have children and also allow people to remove the suffering that people who are in need of adoption face. Adoptees are often the people that have the least access to education, to toys, to a good upbringing, to a childhood that is one that can set them up for future success, and when one adopts rather than goes through a surrogacy, you don't bring a new life into the world but rather you ensure that a life that's already in the world is able to receive loving parents and opportunities in the future. So given that individuals who couldn't conceive on their own have the perfectly viable alternative of adoption, it's unfair to women for women to be coerced into this system for often less money than it's truly worth their time in their effort and the amount of medical expenses that they go through. When there's a perfectly reasonable trade off such as adoption for individuals that do are desperate to have a child, we think that we shouldn't allow as a government and as a society, for the most vulnerable women in our society to be taken advantage of for the good of those who have other means of achieving these things. There are other ways for people and women to be given help. Social welfare exists, other job opportunities exist, but all these things are things you can opt out of where as a surrogacy contract is something that you simply cannot reverse and this is why surrogacy should be banned.
We should abandon social media1. By this, we mean that we think that society should move away from using websites like twitter, facebook, and reddit, and back to more traditional forms of communication and sharing information. Three arguments for why this is the case. First, we think that social media, although it claims to bring people together, actually leads to alienation of people. Why is this so? So, on social media, you see a carefully curated version of a person's life, and we think that ultimately this doesn't reflect any bearing in reality. For instance, you say you're just graduating from college, and you see that your friend is going on a vacation to hong kong, and your other friend has just gotten a new job, and your cousin is getting married, ultimately we think it's quite likely that you're going to compare ordinary moments in your life to the highlights in other people's lives. We think that this leads to people feeling depressed, and dissatisfied, with their own experiences, even if they're actually doing okay, because people don't share average moments on facebook or instagram, they only share the highlights. So, we think that ultimately social media makes its users unhappy. Our second argument for why it should be abandoned, and perhaps the most important, is the loss of privacy and the implications thereof. So, realize that organizations like facebook collect huge amounts of data every year, and then sell it to various different purchasers. In other words, if you're not the buyer, you're the product. Things like facebook are free, because they sell your data to other companies. Why does this matter? First of all, we think that people's privacy is being undermined without their understanding of what's going on. People don't realize that facebook is selling their data to other companies, which then use it to influence them into purchasing things they don't want or need, or otherwise making them do things that they wouldn't like to do. But aside from that, we also think that it undermines other people's freedoms and privacy, besides the person making the posts. For instance, think about how many post you've seen of your friends' children. It's quite likely that those children are going to grow up one day, and all of those photos and videos of them doing things that are maybe cute as a baby, but also embarrassing, will still be online. At that point, we think it's quite likely that these people's right to privacy is being violated, without their consent, because of social media. But on top of that, we tell you that governments are able to take advantage of this information in a tremendously powerful way. We see, for instance, that in many repressive regimes around the world, they either ban western social media, and set up copies of it that collect all the information for them, or pressure companies like google into giving personal information about who is reading what books, who's talking to whom, to the government, and in this way they're able to track movements, and go after dissidents, and this doesn't even have to be something like the PRC rounding up people who are against the communist party, it can be something, like in the united states, government collecting meta data from facebook to determine people who are at risk of joining certain organizations, and then targeting them unfairly with things like the no fly list. Our third argument, for why we should abandon social media, is about how it leads to greater radicalism, and otherwise harmful effects on young people. We see that things like twitter had been tremendously important for terrorist groups to recruit new members, especially in the west. Without twitter and social media, it seems very unlikely that there would have been an isis related killing in san bernardino california, for instance. We tell you that, because social media creates echo chambers, where people only see the content they want to see, it's a sort of curated garden of content, this means that people don't ever actually confront the shortcomings of ideologies and ideas, that appeal to them on a surface level. Movements like the alt right are completely dependent on this echo chamber to radicalize young people, who don't have the breadth of knowledge, or scope of view, to see what's going on. So we think that it should be abandoned as well, because of its role in radicalizing people. For these reasons, we should abandon social media. Thank you.
We should further exploit green technology. So by green technology we basically mean technology that is designed to make it easier for humans to interact with the earth in a positive way and to preserve the earth for birth for future generations. We think that alternative energy like solar panels might be a good example of this, and on top of that, things like mitigation technology. Say, technology to scrub harmful particles out of the emissions from cars or power plants, for instance. So with this in mind, we have three main arguments. The first is about energy and stability. We think that because people rely so much on electricity in their day to day lives, the ability to provide energy to them in a clean, effective, and most importantly, reliable fashion is essential to national stability. In the future, it looks as though we will reach a point when oil will become too expensive to rely upon as we do right now for power generation in many parts of the world, and the same is likely true for coal, although farther away from the present. We can avert this crisis now if we invest, while we still have cheap fossil fuel energy, in alternatives. We can better allow nations to become self sufficient, and ultimately we think that the ability to guarantee that citizens have access to reliable energy so that they can work and live as they're accustomed to do so is essential for national stability in the future, and that because of this we will be much better off by further exploiting green technology. The comparative in this round, of course, isn't just green technology versus no green technology. I'm sure some will exist on either side of the debate. But the comparative is attempting to replace these fossil fuels and exploit green energy more than we exploit fossil fuels and similar sources of energy because those aren't sustainable and these are, so relying on fossil fuels will always put stability at risk in the future. Our second argument is about the duty of current people to future generations. So recognize that of course, there are harms to burning fossil fuels and other things that we would use to or will be replaced by green technology. For instance, we see that the earth is growing warmer, or the climate is changing as a result of CO two emissions. Now, it's probably true that future people are going to have the same types of property rights that current people do, which means that they ought be able to enjoy the property that they own and the common property such as the earth and the seas that they inherit. But because of a something called feedback loops, they won't be able to do so if we don't take action now. Even if in the future very advanced technology allows us to remove CO two from the atmosphere, or otherwise improve the quality of the earth and undo past damage, it seems likely that any irreparable damage that is done is going to be get worse and worse and worse the longer we put off trying to solve the problem. We think that, for instance, the earth getting warmer it gets warmer a little bit every year as more CO two builds up in the atmosphere. But the problem is not linear, it relies on the total amount of CO two in the atmosphere and as that gets greater and greater and greater every year, building off of past years, ultimately the problem gets much more severe and might not be able to be reversed. So we think that by investing further in green technology and adopting it wholesale whenever possible, we guarantee the freedom of future generations to enjoy their property and the earth and things around them, and on top of that prevent creating a situation that they will be unable to improve the earth using their technology. Our last argument is about human potential. We think that fundamentally, what limits human potential in the future is our energy sources. People absolutely have the intellectual capacity to continue to advance and grow, but we see that in the past transitions such as the switch from wood to coal have facilitated massive leaps in technology that allowed human beings to engage with nature and the world in a very different way. If humans are ever going to explore other planets, or the deepest seas, or live on the earth in a completely sustainable way, we think that they will rely on new energy sources to be able to do so. At this point we better achieve a bright future for humanity by investing further in green technology. So for these reasons we think that we better reach human potential at its highest. So for all of these reasons, we should further exploit green technology. Thank you.
We should ban algorithmic trading. So, by this we mean stock purchase orders which are broken down into many small steps rather than executed all at once. So, algorithmic trading might focus on particular metrics in the market and use them to purchase one part of an order and then wait until another metric is met to fulfill another part of the order until eventually, the entire thing is completed and this is all done by computer. So, two arguments for you: the first is that this encourages risky behavior by investors. So, algorithmic trading disassociates the order from the outcome. It makes it more difficult for human investors to recognize the connection between the orders they place and any harmful outcomes or positive outcomes that they might receive. We think that any one step is more likely to be blamed rather than the original intent. So, in other words, if I were to execute a very complicated algorithmic trade and it broke down at some point and I lost a lot of money, I would very likely be angry about the one section of the trade that broke down rather than step back and think that my entire order might have been ill-conceived in the first place if the computer wasn't able to carry it out. We think that people are likely, therefore, to take more risk because they won't associate the outcomes with the actions that they're actually taking. And it's not to say that risk is bad. Obviously, the market requires risk to function and no one will be able to raise capital without it, but ill-considered risk is certainly a bad thing. The kind of risk taking that you want to see in a market is carefully calculated, where people think that the return is going to be worth their risk and where people are thinking about the outcomes of their actions in a very considerate way. But when you break down this consideration because there's such a long chain of events between the purchase order and the outcome, we think you're going to get ill-considered risk that will actually make investing worse for everyone. We think, furthermore, that people are likely to miss the forest for the trees while they're investing. In other words, if you're focused on a handful of metrics in the market when you're trying to decide whether or not to invest, you may be more likely to miss larger trends in the market overall. We think that this is going to be harmful because there will be unforeseen outcomes as investors focus too much on a handful of arbitrary metrics that can never possibly capture the entire scope of the market and everything that's going on. A more old-fashioned approach to trading, where people consider a multitude of factors rather than a handful of algorithms and individual markers for the health of the market, would probably lead to more well-balanced outcomes because it's more all-inclusive. So, therefore, we think that the if we don't ban algorithmic trading, you condemn investors to a sort of general short-sightedness where they're only looking at this outcome or this algorithm today or tomorrow and not thinking about the how their portfolio is going to look ten, twenty years down the line. Our second argument is that algorithmic trading blocks out small traders. So, there's obviously a large competitive advantage for traders that are of a such a scope that they're able to use algorithmic trading. If you're a very powerful investment broker and things like that, you're probably going to have access to this technology, but we think that a lot of ordinary people or community pensions and things like that might not actually have access to this. So, we think that this entrenches an existing competitive advantage where if you want to invest or if you want a pension fund to invest and things like that, you have to rely on one of a handful of large brokers who can actually afford to have all the tools to manage your account and that gives a lot of power to a handful of people. And we think that for small investors who do try to stay in the market, they're going to be victims to a sort of invisible manipulation where, because they don't have access to this algorithmic trading, they're not going to be able to recognize the small changes in the market that are due to this algorithmic trading. So, we think that the effect is that there's going to be a different level of access to information because of this practice, that it will actually harm small investors. We also tell you that the trading market consolidate because of this, that because this technology gives you an incentive to always put your money in the hands of the largest investors who use this technology, this will reinforce control of the market by a handful of banks that have been very powerful for a long time which tend to be controlled by wealthy white men and entrenches a lot of privilege in the market. So, for these reasons, we should ban algorithmic trading.
We should abolish intelligence tests. So intelligence tests, such as an IQ test, are used to determine how intelligent people are according to some arbitrary standard. We think it would be better if these tests were no longer given to students or to potential employees, as they sometimes are in the status quo. Our first of three arguments today is that intelligence tests fuel discrimination and discriminatory ideas. Recognize that there's no such thing as a completely fair intelligence test. Whatever group makes the test is likely to bias it in their own favor. For instance, if an intelligence test is written in german, then likely people who are native speakers of german would do better than recent immigrants. Even if you had a very successful engineer from turkey, living in germany, take the test, it's likely that he or she would score lower than a native german simply because of the bias introduced by language, and that's to say nothing of the enormous cultural biases that could be introduced into these intelligence tests. As a result, when people extrapolate broad, sweeping conclusions from the results of intelligence tests, they build in those biases. It used to be common in the united states to argue that african americans were inferior to whites because they weren't as intelligent. How was this measured? Using IQ tests that were written exclusively by wealthy white men. So, poor african americans didn't score very well, partly because of these cultural barriers, partly for other reasons, and this was used to justify jim crow and other racist policies across the united states. Similarly, in the past, it's been argued that women are less intelligent than men because women's IQ scores tend to be lower, but since the tests are generally written by men, we shouldn't be surprised to see some bias there. Ultimately, we think that these tests can be used to fuel discrimination, they certainly have in the past, and that for this reason we should ban them, so that people don't draw the wrong conclusions from their scores in the future. Our second argument is that these are harmful to the people who take them. There are two outcomes to an intelligence test: one is that you are average or below average, and the other is that you're above average. Let's talk about the former first. For people who score an average intelligence or a below-average intelligence, this is likely to harm their self-esteem. They'll feel like they aren't as smart as their peers, they'll feel worse about their performance in school, and ultimately this loss of self-esteem might make them be a worse employee or a worse student than they would have been if they believed in themselves. So you can actually sabotage people by undermining them, using these intelligence tests. And people who do well on them are likely to rest on their laurels. If people believe that they're already smarter and better than others, then they have less of an incentive to work hard and more of an incentive to try to coast on their smarts, so to speak. So we think that no matter the outcome, this will either damage people's self-esteem or their motivation and undermine them as workers and students. We should ban them for that reason as well. And our third and final point is that intelligence tests are pseudoscience. Intelligence is a societal construct. In some societies, you might be considered intelligent if you're very quick to learn new things. In other societies, you might be considered intelligent if you've used memorization to master lots of facts. In still other societies, skill at certain talents, such as music or mathematics, might be seen as the greatest indicator of intelligence. So whatever standard we use is going to be completely arbitrary. When you try to apply these scientific strategies to this sort of arbitrariness what you get is a pseudoscience that legitimizes people to have incorrect beliefs such as that one group is better than another or that one person is better than another. We think that when this is disproven, it also undermines people's faith in psychologists or other scientists to administer these tests. So for all these reasons, we should ban intelligence tests. Thank you.
We should ban partial birth abortions. So what this debate is about is abortions that are performed in the late second or in the third trimester of the pregnancy. In which the fetus is partially extracted, and has its brain scooped out by a doctor and then the fetus is removed. So these abortions are performed for many reasons. Some might be performed at the mother's request, others might be performed for the safety of the mother or because the fetus has already died, but we are opposed to this in any instance where it isn't medically required. So, with that in mind we have two main arguments. The first of which is that killing a fetus that is able to feel pain, is ultimately wrong. We're not contending that the fetus is the same as a baby that has already been born, but what we are saying is that if you look at the net harm to the fetus versus the mother, you're going to weigh down on the side of the fetus in every single instance. Why is this true? Let's consider the worse case where a mother has severe illness or mental health harms that are actually being suffered from her by the pregnancy. We would be okay with this in those instances because there is a clear and present danger to the mother's life in the form of mental illness. But at other times, when a person may not want to bring a child to term, but isn't experiencing this anguish or mental illness, we think that it's true that there is a certain amount of suffering and disutility going on, but the loss of all future utility to that fetus, compounded with the disutility of having itself be killed by a doctor, clearly you're always going to weigh those harms much more highly. We see that for instance the anguish caused by this pregnancy, is going to be temporary, whereas the harm of being dead, ultimately weighs on forever. But aside from that, we see that although the fetus isn't a person right now, it's clearly has the potential to develop into one. Many children are born prematurely at an and survive at an age when this type of abortion would be performed. So it's clear that the fetus would be able to survive and develop into a healthy human given the opportunity. So at the end of the day we think that it is fundamentally unethical to kill a fetus that has the potential to become a citizen in the future, and that on top of that in your moral decision making, you want always consider more highly the person who served or being that serves to lose the most, rather than the being that serves to have the most rights in the status quo. This is why for instance, even though animals obviously have lesser moral standing than humans, we still don't let people have cock fights, say. Because although there might be utility for the people who practice that sport, the disutility to the roosters is much greater. Now, we're not trying to compare these mothers who want an abortion to cock fighters, but we do think that at the end of the day it would be unethical for the state not to consider what is best for the fetus given this tremendous amount of disutility versus the utility to the mother which, though not marginal, is still lesser. Our second argument is that we think that it is unjust or unethical for doctors to participate in these partial birth abortions. Remember that when someone becomes a medical doctor, they swear the hippocratic oath, which basically states they will never do any intentional harm to a human being. Now, it's questionable at what point a fetus become a person, but certainly they are a human being in the biological sense. We think that doctors ought not be performing this late term abortion that involves killing a fetus therefore, because that fetus, one, is going to develop into a person, and two, meets our standards for what a human is, namely, the ability to continue on as a human being, I suppose. But whatever standard you want to use, we think that doctors are violating one of the oaths that they took, a very serious one moreover, when they perform this type of abortion. We think that the government should step in to prevent them from doing so. Since the state takes responsibility for regulating doctors and for managing medical ethics, so there's a clear precedent for government to intervene to prevent doctors from committing misdeeds and ultimately this would fall into that category. So for these two reasons, we should ban partial birth abortions. Thank you.
The motion for today's debate is that we should subsidize embryonic stem cell research. These subsidies could take any form: it could be through tax breaks for corporations that are like producing embryonic stem cell research, grant money given directly to groups that promise to pursue embryonic stem cell research, basically any like anything like that, or like even offers of government contracts with companies that are doing embryonic stem cell research. With that, two main areas of clash: the first on the enormous benefits that embryonic stem cells provide. Most of the conditions that we currently struggle with can be treated using embryonic stem cells and the kind of cures that they predict. So, currently, the number one killer in the united states is heart disease, a treatment a a condition that we know can be treated with embryonic stem cells but isn't currently accessible, because of the ethical dilemma surrounding them and the unwillingness of private corporations to engage in it for fear of public reprisal. So, we think that once you are giving money to these corporations and saying that we are governmentally sanctioning this kind of research, you can actually access those long-term cures, because you decrease the stigma around the research in the first place. More than this, we think it's important to point out that stem cell treatments are much more long term and cheaper than treatments that we currently use, because a lot of the conditions that we're talking about are chronic pain conditions or currently considered incurable. So what you have is essentially people going in and spending money on treatment after treatment for diabetes, for heart disease, for arthritis, any of these kinds of things, and big pharma corporations benefiting off of it at the expense of the individual. But on our side of the house, you're going to be able to spend this money at the beginning to research what these treatments look like, but then they are permanent treatments that get rid of the condition for the long term. What this means is people who were previously weighed down by chronic pain or chronic conditions and die earlier deaths because you can never actually cure their condition can now have a permanent cure that allows them to be long-term more productive, and also allows them to take that money they were spending on monthly or weekly prescriptions and spend that on other goods that benefit the economy. More than this, we think that some conditions that are that are that are like currently rising with regards to disease rates, this can be cured much more quickly, and this is the fastest way in which to achieve that cure, because what's going on right now is that because you're having such rising rates of these conditions, it's too much and like drives up the price of medication for these families because there are so many people within the united states who suffer from it. So we think that once you are able to make a make a cure that can be more permanent, you will actually be able to deal with the rising numbers of people who have these conditions. We also think that it's good for the economy because it increases the general productivity of people and diverts that spending power from medications to other products. Our second area of clash has to do with ethics, because we think it's important to address the ethical dilemmas that people have with embryonic stem cells. A lot of people are worried about the ethical implications of using what what essentially are the pre-stages of like someone becoming a baby. We think this is silly because it's unclear who's rights you are actually protecting here. This child does not exist yet and will never exist if not for you trying to prevent people from using the embryo. We think that none of the standards are actually met. At the point that this embryo doesn't feel pain, doesn't have a conception of the future, doesn't have any of the associated emotions with understanding that it is an individual being and being upset that it's life is ended, we don't think there is anything that these activists are protecting, because they're protecting something that doesn't even understand it's being protected, but moreover, wouldn't care if you didn't protect it. So, say a dog might not understand you're protecting it but if it gets killed, it is probably not looking forward to that, given that it enjoys existing. The difference here is that this thing never enjoyed existing. But more than this, we think that the people that you're going to be able to protect in the future are much more important, not only because they are already alive, but because they are suffering much more. For these reasons, proud to propose.
Water fluoridation brings more good than harm. The process water of fluoridation is the process of adding fluoride to municipal water, so that people in a community are able to have more fluoride in their system, which has numerous health benefits, primarily though to dental health, into allowing yourself to have healthy teeth. So, we think that this is that this debate is about whether or not there are substantive impacts that occur because of this, and when we think, when you analyze that all the impacts are are beneficial for our side. So, what do we mean by this? Firstly, in studies of fluoride usage. While certain studies have shown that the use of fluoride in water can be unnecessary, and there's disagreement about the exact amount of benefit, that comes from having fluoride in one's water, it's, universally almost, accepted that fluoride doesn't provide any sort of harm to the individual that's consuming that fluoride, that even if it doesn't have the dramatic health benefits that people previously had believed existed, there isn't some sort of massive harm to consuming fluoride. It's not very easy to over overdose on fluoride, to have too much fluoride in one's system, especially because of the amount that this fluoride is distilled within the water. People are able to avoid this fluoride, if they choose to do so, because you can, as an individual, choose to drink bottled water, choose to get water from your own your own like plumbing system, and you can have different ways of getting the water you need, if you want to avoid this fluoride in the first place. But, given, but that is beside the point. Because when you weigh these factors against each other, there's no negative aspect of fluoride that really impacts individuals. And, we think that that means that definitionaly, fluoride must do more good than harm, because even if it only does immoderate amount of good physically, this is still on balance a net gain, and therefore it's more good than it does harm. But, we want to take this a second step further about whether or not this is something that the government should be doing, whether or not there's an action that, in its philosophical sense, is more good than harm. And in that regard, we still think that water fluoridation does more good than harm. We think that the job of government is to provide benefits to the people that you govern, is to provide things, that ensure that their quality of life is better than it otherwise would have been, and to do it in a way, that restricts their freedom in the least amount possible. And we think in in these regards, this checks off in all of them. We think that fluoride is very cost effective to the consumer, it costs very little money, about a dollar per person, per year, to put water to put fluoride in the water, which we don't think for any any developed society is a really high cost, to cover this type of process. People are able to avoid it, and even if they don't avoid it, even if they can't use their freedom to avoid it, it is, at worst, going to have a negligible health benefit in their development, in their health, and in doing so has no does not impede their freedom in any other regard, that they're going to try and use it. So given that this is the case, we don't think that this is something that the government is unjustified in doing, and we think rather it is the job that the government should actively pursue, doing benefits for the people, and in attempting to do that through water fluoridation, we think that this is exactly what the government is meant to do, bringing a benefit that can help the people, especially something that's much more difficult to do on a person to person basis. You can't just put fluoride in the water system on an individual level, it needs to be systemic. And given that that's the case, we think that this is the right arena for the government to be operating in, we think it's the right action for the government to be taking, and that on balance, it certainly does more physical good than harm, and that water fluoridation overall brings more good than harm.
The motion for today's debate is that the US should close guantanamo bay. What we mean by this is that the US would immediately defund, demolish, move the prisoners currently located there to another facility, and thus end the functioning of the prison camp called guantanamo bay, located overseas. Two main areas of clash: first on how it is contrary to US ideologies and international law. Let's talk about the geneva convention, and specifically the ways in which it violates it. So currently the way that the US qualifies guantanamo is that they say that the people there are enemy combatants. The problem with this is that underneath the geneva convention, which the US agreed to, there is no such delineation. For the geneva convention all people are who are taken by other countries must have a must have a status as either a prison of prisoner of war and other state's civilian, or a medical professional who has been taken from another state. And thus there is a convention that is associated with each one. So convention number one for the way that you treat prisoners of war and so on so forth. So, when the US delineates a group of people as enemy combatants, they're breaking out of this bubble and they're essentially saying: " there is no convention and we can treat him them the however the way however the hell we want. " But just because the united states government says that something exists, doesn't make it true. We think that first there's like an ethical issue in terms of following laws that you expect other countries to follow and specifically treating prisoners ethically, but also if the united states is going to get grouchy when others violate laws, it's probably going it probably should be presenting a better example itself, which isn't doing in the status quo. Moreover, abusive treatment of prisoners is an anti american and anti democratic action. The fifth amendment protects criminal rights, including protecting them from cruel and unusual punishment. This applies to anyone whether they're a citizen or not. This, for instance, is why even if you're taking someone who's an illegal immigrant you still can't beat them up in their jail cell. You have to deport them, but like while they're here you still treat them like a person. So, it's unclear why the united states gets to break the rules that apply to any other person just because they aren't directly on the land of the united states. Like they're still being treated by united states personnel, they're still like property essentially of the united states government. At the point that that is occurring, we don't think that there is an ethical delineation, or a legal one. So now let's talk a little bit about these ethics. Because we think that the reason that we have these laws in the first place is because we've defined systems of morality that say this is the way that we should be treating people. And as such we think that people do deserve a trial by jury in the ability to contest evidence. They shouldn't be abused in their jail cells. Not only, and we think that this is a right that is never extended to those who end up at guantanamo bay. They don't have a way to say that this evidence is false or argue for their cause, because they're never put forward like a jury of their peers, and the government hasn't answered to anyone about their treatment of them. This is unethical and devalues a human life. Our second area of clash has to do with the way that guantanamo bay is ineffective and expensive. Recognize first that it's been statistically and scientifically proven that torture is not effective and doesn't actually get you any useful information. We think the bottom line, at the end of the day, is that you could be putting these prisoners into any other prison camp. It's not the case with the way that obama said, that: " oh, these are people that are so especially dangerous that any other holding cell is something they can break free of. " We think that even if you stopped the abusive tactics of guantanamo and like built a similar facility that was also oversees, the just was a regular jail, they would still be perfectly fine within those facilities. Like these people don't have superpowers. We also think that in the end practices like guantanamo alienate our allies who find us unethical. This actually stifles the united states, especially in terms of finding information outlets, because foreign intelligence is less likely to cooperate when they feel like the united states has been behaving unethically. Combine this with the fact that it's a massive money pit on our tax dollars, we just think that it's not worth it. For these reasons abolish guantanamo bay.
Three main reasons we think the affordable care act brings more good than harm: one, it is a step in the right direction and probably the greatest step that could have been taken given the american ethos, two, it gives collective bargaining power to the little people within a medical system, and three, it anchors a broken market in price-setting. Let's start talking about these one by one: so, first of all, let's talk about getting everyone insurance. The american system is, to an extent, broken. It is broken because medical healthcare, which should be a basic right afforded to anyone, regardless of how much money they have, means they have, etcetera, is considered one of those staples of the free market that america loves so much. What does this mean? It means that unlike most modern countries who have national health care given to them by the state, at least to some extent, and then maybe private health care on the side in order to advance, they stick by their private health care, they have all private health care. Now, private health care is a problem because it prices at least some people out of having healthcare. Now, they may say on the other side we agree with this, we think obamacare is problematic because it still doesn't cover everyone. What we want to tell you is this: by making obamacare still to an extent a version of private health care, simply one that is affordable to everyone or almost everyone, you create a situation in which the american people are able to stomach the equivalent of national healthcare. So, we think it is the best way to get to the coverage percentages that you have today, namely that only nine percent of people are now not covered by health care. Secondly, we think it gives collective bargaining power to the weakest in society. We think one of the biggest problems of being ill, of being poor, of being harmed is that when you need help most, there is no one there who can help you and you cannot fight for yourself. This is not solved by private insurance companies because private insurance companies have a market around them which enables battling between them and factions to be created which means no one insurance provider has that much bargaining power versus doctors, versus hospitals, versus pharmaceutical companies. At the point at which you create a baseline medical provider like you have in medicaid, you get substantially greater bargaining power. This is why medicaid gets their prescriptions at a fraction of the price as anyone else on the market, because they've cornered the market on sixty-five years year-olds and up. This is why obamacare can do the same thing for the general population. By creating a baseline that becomes easily the most popular medical insurance in the country, they give massive bargaining power specifically to those poor people who need obamacare and therefore can't afford to pay that much for their medication or for their hospitalization. This fixes that problem. Lastly, it creates an anchor in a broken market. The problem with free market in healthcare is that regardless of the price, you'll be willing to pay it if you're able to do so. There is no price too high for saving your own life or saving the life of your loved one, your child, your wife. Now, there is a price too high in that people are literally incapable of paying it, despite wanting to, but that is the actual line, literally being unable to pay for it. There is no price that people would be unwilling to pay and that creates a problem in the market 'cause it means it continuously strives to go up and this is why you see rising medical care prices year after year after year. By creating a powerful insurance company that anchors the price by saying we set the price at seventy-five dollars a month and that's where we're gonna keep it because we're government-backed and we can do this and this is what we do, you're essentially forcing all of the other insurance companies to contend with that market price, therefore creating an anchor, a price above which people won't be willing to pay not because they don't care about their health, but because at some point, they have a place where they can do it for cheaper. For these reasons, we think obamacare has done more good than harm.
Endangered species are plants or animals at risk of going extinct. Sometimes the cause is unrelated to man but often hunting, land development, and human changes to local environments are the causes of the impending extinction. That is why we should protect endangered species. Let me talk first about the moral obligation that we have to the animal and plant world. Both because we are a moral people and because we have a moral obligation as the perpetrators of the crime in most cases, we are obligated to conserve these species. Let's remember that we are capable of helping. There are ways that we can protect endangered species, be they plants, be they animals. We have lots of different ways, including limiting certain land development in certain areas, protecting species by bringing them in in guarded environments and then releasing them back into the wild, limiting hunting, things like that. And we are a moral people as a whole. We created morality and we have an obligation to ourselves to be good people and to help others when we are able, and that does include other species - those who we use when we need to, but we should be benevolent in cases where we can be. Moreover since we are the cause of most of the damage to the plants and animals, and they are now largely dependent on us in terms of maintaining the environment, we have an obligation to them in that sense. In the sense that we've created dependency on humans and we now need to take care of them. But let's be honest, because morality is important but we are very selfish people. And we need to look at our interests as well. And is it in our interest? It absolutely is in our interest to to preserve endangered species. First of all, because the loss of animals and plants means a loss of medicines. Whether it's a unique compound found in a plant or the venom mused from arachnids and sneaks to cure certain diseases, or or the organs that are similar similar enough to humans to be used in research. So much of our health and so much of the research into health areas is dependent on a thriving ecosystem. We think it's vastly important, when we wanna when we wanna keep inventing drugs and finding new drugs and being able to produce drugs and being able to cure diseases, it is it is of vital importance that we keep every single species that we possibly can in order to investigate them. Because the answers are generally found in plants and animals. That's where we get our healing powers from. And then we have to say what is the ecological value, right? Or in the sing song words of disney - the circle of life. Because it's easy to think about the the loss of animals and plants as and dismiss it and say: " it's just one plant. Who cares? Or it's three plants. Who cares? " But it's not. Because when you lose one plant or when you lose one animal, it creates a chain reaction that affects the rest of the environment. It creates a chain reaction that could lead to the extinction of three or four or five more species in that area that are dependent on that specific animal, or bug, or plant that they were eating in in order to survive. And so when you have these kinds of of links, this chain reaction that you that can be set off when one animal or one plant goes extinct, we think we have an even greater interest in ensuring that there is as little damage as possible to these animals and that nothing goes extinct. That we preserve every species that we possibly can. It is in our own best interest and it is our moral obligation to protect endangered species ladies and gentlemen. And so we must invest in this. Thank you.
The motion for today's debate is that we should raise corporate tax. So I think that we're going to define certain barrier of corporations. We think that only those that are relatively large, so let's say like they earned a like a lot more money than like we think that we can classify in different ways, based on like employee size and how much they make, what a large corporation will be, and I think that's where you like going to raise the corporate tax considerably. And we think it's like a progressive tax, like smaller corporation get a lower one, larger corporations get a really big one, but it would be a raise to whatever we currently have. With that, two main areas of clash: first on the principle justification for why it is okay to do so. Recognize the corporations have plenty of money and that this money is made massively because of capitalist system that inherently oppresses the poor. Recognize that it relies on having cheap labor and consumers that are relatively ill informed of their other alternatives so that they will buy this object, and it takes large amounts of available wealth away from those that might be able to use it better or use it to lift themselves out of poverty. So at the point that all of this is true we think that capitalism, but also just the systems with which corporation's rise to power at all, are structurally disadvantaging those in poverty, and so we actually think that this is very very bad and as such they owe a larger debt back to society due to the drain that they have caused. And and then we also just like want to note that a lot of the time they also politically disadvantage the individuals so that people can get other policy passed, which means that this kind of policy would be helpful in counteracting some of the political influence they have as well. But second I want to talk about marginal utility. Because we think that ten dollars to a wealthy person means less than to someone who is actively struggling, for whom lunch is maybe something they don't know if they can afford, and this is something that can massively help them in such a way. And we think the problem is that that when you take some money away from corporation it's fine insofar as they will have enough money either way. Like at most some high level CEO's will earn a little bit less on our side of the house. But we're fine with that because a lot more money goes into the social system and helps those who are going to be able to use this money most effectively either way. Our second area of clash is about increasing societal good. Because recognize that this money can be used very effectively, rather than to take rich people out to lunches that they'd be able to afford either way, or like become the inheritance that rich children acquire after their parents passed. And we think that that's like very bad and we prefer for that money to go back into the economy and like do social good. We think that being able to redistribute wealth, either through welfare or through direct investment, back into economy has better social outcomes than the things that I just listed that rich people do. First recognize that welfare structurally helps those in need. Being able and like a lot of the time welfare specifically is incredibly underfunded and doesn't actually get like the amount of money that it needs to service the large amount of individuals that would come to rely on it. We think the problem with that is that there's like no one actively giving into that system or helping it enough. So we think that when you take money from a corporations and put it into welfare you're actually creating a world in which you're able to help those most in need more than you currently are. Like provide more food stamps, provide better public housing, invest in programs like education and cheaper colleges, and this is really important because it makes individuals who have previously been signed off by society into people who can actively be more productive and helpful. And we think that it's good when individuals are able to achieve their potential regardless of the fact that they were born into a situation that, outside of their control, pushed them into a box. We also think that economic investment is more macro scale beneficial in a lot of ways as well. We think that taking money away from already established corporations and putting it into start ups is what actually stimulates our economy. Insofar corporations that have created monopolies just stagnate, don't attract new investors, and oftentimes keep a lot of the wealth among themselves so that there's not actually any kind of trickle down, we think that when you are able to support things like start ups or able to put that money elsewhere you're actually stimulating better economic growth on our side of the house. For these reasons, proud to propose.
We should limit natural resource exploitation because limiting natural resource exploitation will be both good for the environment and it's the moral and responsible thing to do in the long run. So let's start by talking about why limiting natural resources is basically a necessity and there's like a lot of reasons for this. First and most notably, a lot of these resources are finite. It may like seem like when you're talking about like vast quantities of things, because like the earth is a pretty big place, so when you're talking about like something like oil or gas or even trees, you you in your mind are thinking of something that is basically endless, even like in the conventional sense like with some renewable resources. But nothing is really can like basically like most of these things don't just like last forever. You're going to run out of like rare earth metals eventually if you just keep using them endlessly. You're going to run out of like fossil fuels and even some like renewable sources of energy. So things like plants if you don't if you use them too much they will die out, and it could take like dozens or hundreds of years for some of these things to like rebuild themselves up. So if you don't limit your natural resources uses, you might you might just run out of it in the first place and then you're not going to have it at all. This is further more likely to be amplified when you talk about the fact that human consumption is only growing for a couple of reasons. First, because humanity is only getting bigger. There's like already what like seven billion eight billion people in the world. That number keeps growing. There's going to be like more and more billions of people as time moves on. So you're just going to get like a higher base number of people. But beyond that, people are also consuming more things. Like western countries consume a whole lot of stuff. Big countries like china and india are starting to consume more things. So as like the world keeps developing, you're also going to see like not just like the raw numbers of consumption going up but consumption per individual person is also going to go up. So you're probably gonna have a crisis of availability of a lot of resources. So this like lack of availability comes with a lot of consequences. The first consequence is that it's just not going to exist anymore. So you're going to have like a really abrupt need to change. So rather than like responsible long term planning and like needing to like use limited amounts of a resource over a long period of time, there may eventually come a time where it just like runs out and then you're fucked. So like like an example of this theory could be something like like there is like a lot of like media hype around like cape town in south africa basically in a drought. It could run out of like there might just there just might not be water in cape town anymore and they'd need to like ship the water out from elsewhere. Now imagine like on a global scale, if you just run out of something like water because you've used up all of the world's fresh drinking water or even more like you just run out of oil, so now all of the cars that currently exist just aren't going to work cause we don't have oil anymore. This is something that like is not entirely unreasonable and if we don't like limit our consumption and plan more responsible for the long term, this is going to happen and that's also going to like, besides just like have forcing like abrupt change you're not going to be ready for, it really is incredibly unfair to future generations who are going to have like a lot of like necessities deprived of them because of all of the irresponsible decisions that were made, hedonistic decisions that are being made in the present. And this doesn't even get into all of the like realities of like responsible climate change and things like that in that you want to like try to curtail climate change, you want to make sure that the earth is actually livable in the long term. So for all those reasons, we should limit natural resource exploitation.
Casinos should be banned. So we are going to argue that government should not permit the construction of new casinos and should gradually phase out old ones. So these should be casinos in places like las vegas or macau, that would be shut down over time and new ones, like the one being built near boston right now, would not be allowed to open in the first place. Three arguments for our side: the first is that casinos' business model is coercive. Basically in order to get people to come in and play their games casinos have to mislead people about the odds of winning. If everyone knew that ultimately you will always lose money by playing at a casino, then many fewer people would participate. But instead they choose to portray it such that games like roulette games of chance, where anyone can win, although actually this isn't really true. We think that ultimately the government needs to step in because you shouldn't be able to uphold contracts between people when one side is coercing or misleading the other. In other words, when you go to a casino and buy chips, you're entering into an agreement with them but you're doing so on faulty premises, namely the idea that you can win money by playing the games in the casino. In fact, this isn't really true because their business model is to fleece people. At that point we think that governments need to intervene, not allow these contracts to be formed, because one side has such an imbalance of power and information over at the other side. We see that states do this all the time, such as by preventing children from entering into contracts because they walk decision making ability. The people going to casinos similarly lack access to the information to make good decisions. Our second argument is that casinos are bad for the communities which host them. This is a huge debate anytime they want to build a new casino somewhere. Ultimately we see that while it is true that casinos bring in tourism money, they don't spread that money around to the community. Generally speaking, when people go to a casino, they stay at a casino hotel, they eat at the casino restaurant and they spend money gambling in the casino. They don't go around to local landmarks and things like that because in general people travel there with things like all in one vacation plans etcetera, or they go to an area for the purpose of going to this casino. What that means is that casinos consume a large amount of resources from the community. Things like obviously utilities, but also taking people who work there for relatively low wages, who aren't doing productive work, because what do you get out of a casino? But give relatively little back to the community around them. Small businesses in the community don't really benefit from having these casinos in place. What's more, it's likely that they bring in lots of unsavory elements. Groups like organized crime often control casinos even when they're operated in a legal fashion. What's more, they also encourage things like prostitution, because people expect to have access to that at casinos, and this then brings crime into the community which was absent before. We can see that places like las vegas are very seedy and not somewhere that many people would want to live. So ultimately we tell you that casinos are harmful for their communities and that this is a good reason to ban them, because they're bad for the people who have to live around them. Our third argument is that the alternative world is one with much less gambling and that this is probably a better world. Gambling is fundamentally very addictive and bad for people. Many people experience the same kind of reaction to gambling that you or I might to cigarettes. They feel it's very addictive. So these people cannot make a rational decision about whether or not they want to continue gambling and things like that. But people would be very unlikely to start gambling if there were no legal venue to do so. Relatively few people gamble illegally. So we tell you that in a world without casinos many fewer people would develop gambling addictions. We think that this would obviously be good for those people and for society as a whole. The other side might try to argue that illegal casinos will open up but we just don't see that this is the case in places like new york city where gambling is illegal right now. So for all of these reasons casinos should be banned. Thank you.
We should ban homeopathy. Homeopathy is pseudoscience taken to an incredible level. It has allowed the market to take over for BS spiritual healing and generally push this sort of ideas on innocent and naive individuals, who then harm themselves due to homeopathy. Because we think that there's an incredible amount of misinformation out there and because the ultimate harm of homeopathic medicine cannot be determined, we would say the government has an affirmative obligation to outright ban it. The model that we would propose to ensure that there is not abuse of this kind of law is that any sort of homeopathic medicine be required to have a massive label saying it is ineffective and generally doesn't work. We think that individuals can still take ginger supplements, can still take vitamins, but we would require that their labeling first say that this is not actively medicine, secondly say that it does not ever count as a substitute for conventional medicine, and third, not be allowed to use flowery language or claims. This is to say if I'm selling ginger, I cannot say that it will cure cancer, or even say that it will decrease the chance of a stuffy nosed. It can only say that is a ginger supplement, and that is it. Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first, why the government should ban it. We think that there's an information asymmetry which comes from homeopathy, which generally comes from it's inaccurate labeling and the information surrounding it being generally untrue. Because we think that there's a cult following around it and be because there's a market incentive to promote this cult, individuals largely do not know the extent to harm of homeopathic medicine. This will allow the government to ban it as there is largely a train that has gone from the station, which is pushing people towards death and generally a worse quality of life. The second standard is that there are third-party harms from homeopathic medicine. If there are harms to people who do not consent to the harms, government must step in to protect these people because they cannot protect themselves. The individuals who are harmed most by homeopathic medicine are children. They did not get to pick what goes into their body, largely because we provide that right to the parents. And yet, conventional medicine, things like antibiotics, are ignored for homeopathic medicine with startling frequency. Because of this, the government must step in and ban it. The third standard is if there's if the government is the only actor who can check abusive market practices. Because we think that no individual consumer or no individual organization can check homeopathic medicine and ensure it is not sold, the government must step in and ban it, which brings me to my second argument about homeopathic medicine supplanting conventional medicine. A massive problem in our present day is that homeopathic medicine is used instead of conventional medicine. It is okay when it is used along side of it but largely, because it replaces it, it can cause massive harms. If homeopathic medicine were effective, it would be called conventional medicine. Even though like ancient peoples had roots, had powders, which were effective, all of those have been coopted into conventional medicine. Everything that is left is not effective. As such, spiritual gurus and corporations who push homeopathic medicine can cause incredible harm to people, increasing the total cost of our healthcare system and increasing the total loss of life. This brings me to my third harmful argument about how it can be actively harmful. First, it is unclear the interactions regarding homeopathic medicine versus regular medicine. This can cause fatal interactions which can cause death. Secondly, there can be bad chemicals within homeopathic medicine. Corporations still want to save money and as such, they are liable to use incredibly problematic ingredients within their medicine. Third and finally, it is impossible to know the total side effects of these kinds of medicines cause we do not know the effect and because we don't regulate them like medication. As such, we should ban homeopathy.
School vouchers are beneficial. So basically, the way that school vouchers work is people pay the normal taxes that they would pay that goes towards a fund, but parents have the option to rather than send their child to a neighborhood school, send their child to another school by turning in a voucher. So that might be a charter school which is a kind of semi private school that started by a private group but funded by the state and held to certain government standards, or even a private or parochial school we're perfectly fine with people using these vouchers at catholic schools for instance, on our side of the debate. So, two arguments for why these are beneficial. The first is about maximizing individual choice. We think that broadly speaking, governments or an institution that limits people's freedom we see that, you know in a state of nature, parents would presumably have the freedom to send their children to any form of education that they wish, with no intervention from anyone else. That would be a state of maximum freedom. Now obviously, we want to guarantee certain minimum standards and we want to be sure that children are being educated well enough to become functional citizens, so the state has a clear interest in limiting people's freedom in some respect, in as much as it requires them to have their children get an education. But we don't think that government needs to intervene at the level of deciding which school the children go to. We think that if parents want their children for instance to get a catholic education, ultimately that's not the concern of the government. These people who come out of catholic school are just as able to be functional citizens. The people coming out of charter schools are just as able to be functional citizens anyone else. They can get jobs, they have all the skills that we care about, so it's not really our concern whether they have a religion class twice a week at the end of the day, and I think that that's really the comparative. The other team might try to tell you that some charter schools are like this unregulated libertarian nightmare, but if that's the case we think that the solution to this problem is to regulate schools better, not to get rid of vouchers. We think that by maximizing choice you also empower parents. We think individual parents probably know what's best for their child better than the government. Recognize that lawmakers can't consider what's best for every individual child. Imagine if you had a kid for instance was being bullied in their neighborhood school, who needed to go into a different school to get away from that but their parents didn't have enough money to afford it, we think that vouchers could be a really powerful tool there. We also think that if you had children with special needs those might be better met at a different school farther away than in your neighborhood, and school vouchers again could be a way to maximize choice in that respect. So this would ultimately maximize freedom, and be better for children with special needs are who are facing special circumstances. Our second argument is about integration and access. We think it's likely that charter schools will be much more diverse than neighborhood schools. Most people probably live in neighborhoods where their neighbors are similar to themselves. The neighborhood I grew up in, most people were white americans, for instance. I think that's probably true everywhere in the world people live with people who are similar to themselves given the choice. It's unfortunate but true. With that in mind though, we think that you would get more integration of people from different racial, ethnic, religious, cultural, language backgrounds, through these schools, because if anyone could turn in these vouchers then you'd probably have something like a lottery system, and you would have students who were from an immigrant background or hispanic or black or white, going to the same schools. And we think that this would ultimately lead to a society where more people were empathetic towards those who are different from themselves because they're socialized with them at a young age. And in terms of access, I think that these vouchers increase the access to really good schools for low income students. Unfortunately right now there's a tendency that wealthy areas have good schools and low income areas have bad schools. But with these vouchers if you're a parent and you know that your town doesn't collect a lot of tax revenue, so your private sorry, public school isn't that good, you can send your child to a better school, ensure that they get a better education, and ultimately we think it's more likely that those children will go on to get back to their community and help to make this a rising tide that lifts all boats kind of things, by investing that education in helping others, or at least that they're more likely to do so than people from outside the community. So for these reasons, school vouchers are beneficial. Thank you.
We should further exploit small modular reactors. When we say we're going to further exploit the small modular reactors, we mean that we should further increase our use of these things, both in more remote areas that struggle to get their electrical needs and for businesses, large manufacturing areas that require immense amounts of electricity that may want to move off the grid, and we think that this should be subsidized in large part by the government in order for people to adopt these things en masse. Okay. So, two reasons why we think that small modular reactors are good: first is that nuclear energy is generally quite clean as compared to fossil fuels and and other alternative energies, and the second is about the immense energy potential and why this is so important, especially moving forward in a developing world. Okay. So, on clean energy: compared to fossil fuels, nuclear reactors and small modular reactors having much lower impact on the environment. They don't because the type of deforestation and environmental degradation that fracking and other types of drilling cause. They don't require you to clear out large swathes of land in order to use these types of things, and they don't create the excess CO two that leads to global warming. This is crucial, because it's important to recognize that global warming is not only happening, but it's happening dramatically and quickly and that we need to quickly shift away from what we're doing in the status quo in order to prevent the worst effects of global warming from happening. In order to do this, we need to take advantage of all of all the resources that are available to us for renewable energy. We can't just we can't just resort to solar and wind and say that the job is done. We need to try and move the entire grid off of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. To do this, we think that small modular reactors are going to be a necessary way of enacting these changes, especially in areas that are much more remote than others, that aren't able to get access to these other types of renewable energy, for example, in areas where wind power and solar power simply is not going to meet the burden. It's also important to recognize that meltdowns generally are quite rare. So when the opposition may say that small modular reactors are bad because you're more likely to get a meltdown, firstly, these are actually less likely and more efficient than large nuclear facilities to have a meltdown, and the rates of some sort of a meltdown are incredibly low compared to, for example, the likelihood of an oil spill from an oil rig contaminating and ruining the environment for decades to come. These things happen much more likely, yet we don't completely force people to to flee from fossil fuels. We think that we have a comparatively cleaner technology that we should adopt, especially due to the impacts of global warming. Secondly, on the immense energy potential. The type of energy creation this is the type of energy creation that can be done in almost any environment. So unlike other types of renewable fuels and other types of fossil fuels, you don't really need to have any sort of particular geographical advantage in order to use a small modular reactors. They also be lower cost of energy than almost any other source once you get the energy up and running. Once you have a bulk use of small modular reactors, they're much easier to create, on the cheap, per kilowatt of energy than other types of energy, and this is why we should try to subsidize these things. So that we can get the market up to scale in order to make it efficient enough and cheap enough to be worthwhile. We would say that the grid is only going to be more heavily used in the future as more and more people become developed and start needing the electricity to live a modern life. Given that this is the case, we're going to need more to power the future, and it needs to be done more efficiently than possible or than has previously been done and is certainly being done in the status quo. In order to do this, we think a clean technology such as nuclear is a smart way to go and for these reasons, we should further exploit small modular reactors.
We should abolish term limits because term limits are anti-democratic, can be bad policy in a decent amount of circumstances and they're not necessarily inherently bad in the first place. So for starters, term limits are inherently anti-democratic and the reason for that is because when you're talking about what an ideal democracy should look like it's one where the people are maximally empowered to choose who they think is best able to enact their ideals, their ideas and policies into actual action. And and whatever people think is going to be the best for them that's a choice you make. So in order to be just in that way you want to be minimally restrictive in who you allow to run for office. So things like term limits, things like age limits, limits of all kinds that restrict who's allowed to get who's allowed to get access to office is necessarily bad because it restricts the rights of the people to decide who their leaders are. And it allows whoever sets like these archaic laws in the first place oftentimes to make these decisions. But secondarily term limits can also be bad from a policy perspective and a very clear example of this could be you know someone like FDR where it may make sense to have somebody who's in power for more than one term. So let's say that you're in the middle of a war and you may not want to change leaders in the middle of a war, it could be in the middle of an economic crisis, or it could just be that there is not anyone that's more qualified for the position then the person who could run for the third term and that's who the people think is going to be most capable of actually getting things done because no more experience than you have in position maybe you're going to be better at it. All of those could be perfectly valid circumstances under which it would make sense for somebody to have multiple terms, and certainly not be limited by anything. The the final thing that I want to talk about it is term limits aren't necessarily bad and they're only bad insofar as the democratic process itself isn't being followed. So obviously if you have like people who are proclaiming themselves as presidents for life that's like inherently suspect because it's essentially saying that like you're going to be president forever and not necessarily subject the public well. I don't really think that that's what term limits are about. The idea behind term limits is that if you let someone rule for like fifteen years instead of like ten years or something like that, then suddenly that person is becoming more despotic and their rule over the country's tightening or something, which I think is a little bit ridiculous because it's all about who the person that's wielding power is and whether or not the democracy itself is healthy is probably independent of whether or not there are term limits. So for all those reasons do not we should for all those reasons we should abolish term limits.
We should abolish intelligence tests. So in this debate we're gonna make two two main arguments. The first is that intelligence, as quantified by these tests, is a bad concept a flawed concept that doesn't actually reveal any information, and the second is that these tests are generally used for bad purposes. So on the concept of intelligence: intelligence tests are based on this idea that there are some mental quality that is all encompassing, that can be back to be qualified as well, as to how smart you are. That this idea of being smart, of being intelligent, is a is a one type of thing. It's not a multitude of things, but rather it is one thing that we can quantify and from that quantification we can make judgment calls and use that data for further for further purposes. We think that intelligence in reality comes in so many different forms and that people can vary in what types of intelligence they excel in. For example, there are some people that have quantitative intelligence, which is often what these intelligence tests are trying to find. The type of intelligence that allows you to do basic mathematics, to understand spatial reasoning, to do the things that engineers and physicists and these types of people are able to do. There's also though emotional intelligence. The understanding of not only your own emotions but those around you, and how to react to those emotions in such a way to make people feel better. To play off those emotions in a way that benefits you. There's also social intelligence. The type of intelligence that understands your community and your immediate social situation. Intelligence tests can really distill only one type of intelligence. This quantitative intelligence. And even then they only do it in, such a in, they can only do so so well. There are many other longitudinal ways of measuring this type of quantitative intelligence that we think are even preferable to intelligence tests if you want to get this type of intelligence. But we don't actually think you get any useful information from these tests. However because because it tries to quantify something like intelligence in a poor manner that can't actually be quantified in a one catch all term of intelligence. What we do think though is it leads to people making misinformed choices when doing things like hiring a new employee, like choosing a career or a college path because an intelligence test told you you would be best suited for one thing, or choosing which which classes to take in school, and these types of intelligence tests can affect someone at any stage in their life. So what of those additional bad purposes that we were talking about that we think intelligence tests are used for? As we've shown they simply don't work to divine any useful information. And there are harms that arise from these tests. Those who don't perform well simply feel belittled. They feel lesser than because they're stupid or unintelligent. And it turns into a self fulfilling prophecy, where those people under perform because they set low expectations for themselves. If you are told in a quantitative way that you are less smart, less mentally capable than those around you, this tells you that there's some sort of barrier that you cannot overcome. That intelligence isn't fluid but rather it static and that you cannot go above and beyond what your natural capabilities are. None of this is true. But it tells people that this is the case and then from there people set expectations that are lower and lower of themselves and they justify it by saying: " I don't have the intelligence to do any more than what I'm already doing, and it's not my fault. There's nothing else that I can do. " All these things are wrong and it creates tears and divisions between people in our society. And it creates a lower class, an underclass of people. We think that this is a fundamentally problematic system. That having intelligence tests breeds a resentment for other for intellectuality generally and that it breeds resentment for oneself if you are said to be intelligent enough. They also don't really divine and useful information for further planning. And for these reasons we should abolish intelligence tests.
We should cancel the patriot act. The patriot act represents one of the worst policies ever adopted by the modern united states government and as such must be removed. It was passed in a fervor of confusion and through massive coercion through a political body which demanded that it was infallible right after nine eleven. As such, we would support the following model: that the patriot act be removed and that individuals who can prove that they were unjustly harmed as a result of it become compensated massively for these harms from the government. With that, I have three arguments. First that the patriot act is unconstitutional. We think the patriot act violates two key amendments to the united states constitution. First is the fourth amendment. The fourth amendment protects individuals from unreasonable search and seizure. It guarantees that we have some privacy rights and has been essential for passing precedent on things like abortion rights but also simply in protecting our ability to have free speech which is unregulated by governments. With that in mind, we think the patriot act has massively stifled speech and massively destroyed our privacy as it expanded the police state and allowed for further surveillance apparatuses to be placed on the average individual. Organizations like the NSA were although they were not created through the patriot act have their power massively expanded and as such our communications have been monitored ad nauseum since its passage. We think this is fundamentally unjust and also violates the united states government's obligation to its citizens as enumerated in the constitution. The second amendment it violates is the fourteenth amendment which guarantees equal protection under the law. The patriot act has effectively made being a muslim in the united states considerably more difficult. The vast majority of harms which have been a result of the patriot act have been actualized upon minority groups and as such we think that it has had inequal application based on race and based off ethnicity. We think this violates the core of the fourteenth amendment which demands equal protection under the law. The supreme court has routinely found that particular bills and particular laws are unjustified eventhough they do not have explicit racism but because they have an implicit racism which was actualized upon the execution of the bill. With this in mind we think that the constitution is incredibly important. The only way in which government can effectively maintain its legitimacy is if it maintains its obligations to its people. We would say that the only way that rights exist is through a contract because there's no power up above our power inside of us which inherently give us rights it is simply how we agree or make agreements with the government. If the government fails in this regard, it has truly betrayed our trust, stolen our resources, and effectively made our lives worse. My second argument is about societal effects. We think the patriot act has massively created a stigma against islam in the united states. Because the execution of the policy has largely been against these individuals, the average person has also reflected the opinions expressed by our government. This is problematic because we think we should generally decrease hate particularly as a goal of government policy. My third arguments about the political effect of the patriot act, because it is massively decreased our security, as is put in place expansions of the TSA and clandestine operations which ultimately don't actually increase our security but simply just make people feel safer. As such we've become complacent in a system which still allows for terrorist attacks. Finally, the worst political effect has been the ability of of using national defense as a defense in court. Huge amounts of evidence, particularly about corporations, have not been entered into the public domain because they simply claim that it is for national defense and many judges have agreed with them because of the fervor around the patriot act. Removing it would empower individuals and guarantee they find justice in courts of law. As such, we should cancel the patriot act.
International volunteering brings more harm than good. Obviously we have nothing against people who choose to devote from their time and volunteer. And if the comparative would have been between volunteering abroad and not volunteering at all then obviously we'd prefer that people would volunteer. But the counterfactual that we believe that is true in this debate is that people will volunteer more with local charities and we need to explain why we think that this is better. Why do we say that this is the true competitive? Because there exists many like very few people that truly devote their entire lives for helping the weak. And that is understandable. Normally people only search for a place to volunteer, which is by the way already a minority of people and not something that can be taken for granted, so normally these people will focus on one purpose that they see is especially important. This means that whoever ends up traveling to the other side of the world for a year in which he volunteers with children in africa for example, in most cases once that year is over he'll be returning home feeling gratified and satisfied as he well should and move on to think of himself, his career, his family, and his future. However on the other hand, people that choose to volunteer at local charities like, once a week, closer to home, in a way that doesn't necessarily force them to go through great sacrifices or stop the routine of their life, their day to day lives. Often these people stick around for many many years. Exactly because this is not such a great bother as like compared to going off and living in a tent in conditions that are radically different from the comfort of your own home. So why do we prefer the model of volunteering once a week across many years over the model of one intensive year in which like you do concentrated volunteering? Firstly, we assume that either way we are talking about good deeds that if it weren't for me there would be nobody else to step in and do instead of me. And that is simply true because unfortunately there is always a need like there's always more need for help than actual help offered. Secondly, we believe that all the charities and all the volunteer work that I could possibly do are equally important. Even if we accept that the situation of the needy in africa is worse than the situation of the needy in the west, in absolute terms, eventually a hungry family is a hungry family and a sick child is a sick child. And if we can do something about it, if we can cheer up a sick child or somehow get food like a warm meal for a hungry family, then we have done something equally wonderful. Lastly, and most importantly, in many types of volunteer work there is great advantage in tenure. This is true both in cases where experience is needed in order to be able to perform your volunteer work more efficiently would like more complicated cases like medical assistance and so on, but also in simpler cases where there is simply a lot of like importance to creating a long term connection with the population to which we assist. Think about cases of make creating an emotional bond with orphaned children for example. What happens with these international volunteering is that often by the time that you that you gain experience and start and starting to be good at what you do, then your time is up and someone entirely new steps in. Or, that by the time that that the true emotional bond is being formed between you and the local population, you're forced to leave. And that is obviously difficult for both sides but especially to the people that again feel abandoned. For all these reasons we say that international volunteering brings more harm than good.
We should abandon television. So in this round we think it's important to draw a comparison between television what we think would come to replace it. We think in abandoning television what you're more likely to get is an alternative, more specialized form of media that is primarily probably coming through the internet. We think should abandon traditional cable outlets traditional forms of television. We think that alternative mediums are actually quite beneficial for their own reasons specifically, that we think that these types of mediums allow for more connected communication between followers of these types of media. So we think that for example, a television following is less interconnected than an online following of similar type of content because individuals are more able to clearly comment and more easily communicate directly with one another. We think there's closer communities generally that end up allowing people to be more actualized and more active in their consumption of media. We also think that these other forms of content creation are much more open source. What we mean by this is that the barrier to entry into television and to cable television is incredibly high in regards to the fact that there's an immense amount of money in financing needed and that there's a limited amount of real cable outlets for which people can show content but in the case of the internet and other types of specialized media, that we think is the comparison, we think that these are much more easy for other individuals to enter which means we think you get more niche types of content that allow people to be more pleased with the content they're generating. We think that people are going to have a more preferable media experience generally if we were to switch to a different type of primary form of consumption. We also think that there's just more possibility for interaction, for innovation. We think that the current TV confines that exist are fairly constraint in regard to what people are willing to do in regards to the norms that exist around television. We think those norms don't exist on places like the internet. We think that's something that allows for again better creation. So that's about why the alternative we think is preferable. So why do we can television is uniquely so much more harmful? So we think that television has historically been incredibly bad for the health of the people in countries where it has become prominent especially in developed countries. We think there's a major issue with inactivity in the status quo. We think that it's very clear through things like rising obesity rates, rates of diabetes, and that these trends follow the amount of increased hours of television consumption in specifically the american public and in the public more generally worldwide. We think that television is a type of media consumption that is always going to be focused on the living room. That's always can be focused inside the house and that because it's such a central part of the household is something that people learn to consume from a very young age. That children become comfortable with being in front of a television and that it ends up in leading to adults that are more situated for that type of experience, that are more socialized to see that type of media outlet, and that type of primary entertainment. We think it leads to more lazy and generally less healthy individuals. We think that in comparison to alternative forms of media, firstly, there are often calls to action on these alternate forms of media, calls to meet up, because so much of the media is interactive. There's an incentive to go out but you're also not stuck in front of a TV in your living room when you're when you're consuming other sorts of media, things like podcasts and online content or things that can be consumed on the go and that allow you to have more content that is more niche, more preferable for the for each particular individual and that doesn't constrain the individual to norms of sitting their living room on their couch, something that is overtly bad for their health and for their future and for these reasons, we believe we should abandon television.
We should ban anonymous posts because anonymous posts create a culture on the internet of harassment and it silences discourse and it additionally also leads to devaluing of discourse and overall worse discussions about substantive issues in society and I think that those are very bad things that the government directly has a business in regulating. So first let's talk about what I think is the most severe issue and that's that anonymous posting creates it makes it a lot easier to have harassment. And I think that the reason why this happens is because when you don't have to actually attach your identity to what you're posting, you feel more emboldened to do things that you may otherwise be more unwilling to do. So obviously there's crimes on the books about things like stalking, about harassing, about publishing private information about people. These are all things that are illegal in the status quo, however when these things are done via anonymous posts or false identities, it makes it so that it's incredibly difficult to so that it's actually incredibly difficult to enforce these laws because the internet is just so widespread. The internet just like so like easy to use and accessible to so many people that it becomes and since all of your information, everything is oftentimes on the internet nowadays, whether you have hackers or just bad people, they're able to get access to this information and do incredibly bad things to you. And I think when you ban anonymous posts in addition to more directly targeting the postings itself, you're also targeting the sites that allow that serve as a platform that enable these kinds of harassments and things like that to happen in the first place. So no longer well like places like 4chan or like r/alt_right on like as a subreddit or things like that no no longer will like these kinds of like anonymous areas be able to function as essentially incubators for the worst kinds of people in society. Because now they're not going to be able because the sites don't want to get shut down, the sites are going to be worried about their own legal repercussions and their own interests. So they're not going to have as so if you ban anonymous posts then they're obviously not going to let their own people get involved in these kinds of things and you can put the onus on these platforms to conduct like identity checks and things like that. So that way you actually have enforceable anti-harassment laws and more enforceable privacy laws and things like that. And I think in like the internet age where all these things are very prevalent problems, this is a very real policy issue that we need to solve. But the next thing that I want to talk about is I want to talk about trolling and the impact that this has on discourse and the like. Because I think this is very important in that people, because of the threat of harassment or the threat of violence and things like that, are possibly not as willing to express their views on the internet which is a primary platform for communication nowadays. So like any time for example you criticize maybe donald trump supporters on twitter or things like that, you can open yourself up to anything from death threats to like your identity being hacked or your accounts being hacked and all kinds of things like that. So it makes it more unlikely that people won't even feel comfortable expressing themselves. So that suppresses discourse which is obviously something that is pretty bad. But I also think that it makes it more likely that you're going to see things like trolling, you're going to see things like that that are going to further degrade the discourse that we have in society which makes discussions more uneducated, discussions more hyperbolic, less ground in reality and informed, higher prevalence of fake news because people are more willing to like spread around false lies and rumors and things like that if there's no shame or stigma attached to like them putting their face not themselves. I think that banning anonymous posts can get rid of a lot of these problems. So for those reasons we should ban anonymous posts.
We should introduce a smoking ban. Smoking is an incredibly unhealthy activity. Even those people who do smoke, who don't intend to stop smoking tell other people you should never start smoking. The physical dependence that it breeds, the health harms that it causes, ultimately means that people live shorter lives, worse lives and spend a massive amount of their disposable income on smokes. Because we think that cigarettes are such a problematic part of our society, we think the only way that we can truly uproot them and get it out of the common conscience is by a total smoking ban. As such, we propose the following model: that the united states federal government ban all cigarettes, all tobacco and any way in which you can consume tobacco including things like dip, chewing tobacco, any sort of way that you can get this nicotine into your system. Three arguments why this is a good idea. First, smoking is incredibly unhealthy first for the individual who starts smoking. The physical dependence it's it breeds and the way it harms your lungs means that most people who start smoking will die of lung cancer. If that doesn't happen, smoking gradually clogs your arteries, puts tar into your system and makes heart attacks far more likely. Anyone who smokes has a considerably decreased expected life total and were we to ban smoking we think that we would massively increase the total quality of life for many people and this isn't just for the individual. When these people spoke it harms other people in two ways. First, if people are having more heart attacks, if people are having more cancer, if they demand more medical resources, they drive the total cost of healthcare up. Insurance premiums are ways in which insurance companies can charge healthy people to help unhealthy people. As such, the ultimate result of insurance policies mean that smokers will charge you more money. Additionally, as they fill hospital rooms, as they make doctors more in demand, these individuals can demand a higher wage as well which ultimately means that healthcare becomes even less accessible particularly for people in poverty. It's incredibly unclear why individuals who have willingly elected to smoke deserve this sort of protection above people in poverty many of whom had no say in their predicament. Secondly though, secondhand smoke is incredibly harmful. Children around smoking adults can also develop lung issues, can also develop asthma and developmental issues. Adults around other adults can also be harmed by secondhand smoke. It's just as bad if not worse in some situations as smoking or actively smoking a cigarette as the individual doing it. My second argument is it's incredibly costly. Each individual who smokes spends almost a thousand dollars each year just on cigarettes. A pack a day smoker will spend far more than a thousand dollars. This cost is fundamentally unacceptable. Because nicotine creates an addiction because there are other addictive chemicals in cigarettes, these companies are essentially using a chemical dependence to get money out of other individuals. We think this is fundamentally unethical and unacceptable and we don't think we should allow any company to continue profiting off of addiction and the harms it causes. My third and final argument is that cigarettes are environmentally harmful. The vast majority of cigarettes are simply tossed out of windows and thrown on the ground. In my home of the pacific northwest, a lot of the time this causes forest fires which can take thousands of lives and destroy millions upon millions of dollars worth of property. In most cases it simply kills local animals, destroys local areas, makes things look disgusting and is just a bad scene over overall. As such, we should introduce a smoking ban order to help our environment as well.
Use of the AI should be abandoned. And I hope that the computer debater won't be offended here. It's nothing personal. I promise. That said, we see two main reasons why the use of AI should be abandoned. The first is that we think that the long term risks are generally going to outweigh the short term benefits, and the second is about the trade off in research and development funds. So to focus on the long term risks and the short term benefits of artificial intelligence. It's certainly true that increasing use of artificial intelligence in manufacturing and other industries has increased global economic products. It would be very difficult to produce the amount of automobiles we do right now for instance without automated factories. However these benefits largely accrue in the short term and we think that ultimately a few harms are going to outweigh them: the first is the massive destruction of the economy. We've already seen many people laid off because automation has taken away their jobs. But this is fundamentally different than other technologies. No one would advocate for getting rid of cars just to keep horses employed, but we think that it's quite likely that in the future people will be largely unnecessary for most industries if AI keeps improving at a quick rate. For instance, we think that AI is very soon going to completely replace trucking, manufacturing jobs, and some of the other most common professions in the united states, and leave tens of millions of people unemployed. Right now the american welfare system does not have a way to cope with tens of millions of people suddenly becoming unemployed. Now, an optimist would say that other jobs will come along to let these people do work. But we think it's likely that soon AI will be so good that it can design new AI to do its job even better and replace even more human workers. And what's more, that because payroll tends to be the most expensive part of running a business, that corporations will do everything they can to lay off as many people as possible and not offer them new jobs. So we think that this is going to be fundamentally different than previous technologies that temporarily destructed the labor market, and that this could very well prevent humans from participating in the labor market at all in the long to medium term. We could be the first generation that sees unemployment in western countries rise over fifty percent, and it will be because of automation. But moreover, not to sound like a conspiracy theorist, that no one knows just how powerful AI is going to get. What happens when people outsource major policy decisions to AI, because it's seen as neutral? Which is something they're already discussing in the US as a solution to gerrymandering. To have an artificial intelligence design our voting districts. We think that ultimately an AI could make decisions that aren't the best for people and everyone will go along with them because they're seen as neutral or because a few people in power want to go along with it. So we think that there's a risk to great dependence on AI undermining our society in many ways. And our second argument is that this is a poor use of r and d funds. To be frank it just seems to me that research and development should be focused on alleviating the most serious harms and artificial intelligence doesn't really play into that. Right now there are eight hundred million people in food insecurity around the globe and hundreds of millions who lack access to clean water. Coming up with more effective ways to distribute food and more effective ways to ensure that people have access to the resources that they need seems like a much better use of r and d funds than making a ford slightly cheaper and more efficient to produce. And what's more, we also think that this trades off with medical funding which could save people's lives. Now some might say that artificial intelligence will increase economic growth and that a rising tide lifts all boats, but as long as millions of people are dying from easily preventable diseases like diabetes, that don't have a cure yet, we think that that money would always be better spent on something like a cure for diabetes than it is on these machines. For all these reasons, the use of AI should be abandoned. Thank you.
We should legalize sex selection. Sex selection is a relatively innocuous process in which particular sperm and embryos are selected such that a child has a particular gender upon birth. It allows parents to express gate greater control over their children's future and, as such, express greater control over their own future as well. We think that individuals should have as much control as possible over their own future, and when we deny individuals this sort of autonomy and this sort of self-determination, we are being fundamentally oppressive. To this end, we support the following model: that countries around the world allow sex selection. They will allow in vitro fertilization which allows the sex to be selected or any other process that does not depend on terminating an incorrect pregnancy. We're not going to defend sex sex-selective abortions here, but we think that nearly any other tool is fair game in this debate. Three arguments for why this is a good idea: first, on the rights of parents. We think that parents sacrifice a massive amount to have a child. It's incredibly difficult to raise a child from infancy to adulthood, and it costs huge amounts of money. For many individuals, they want to have a number of children of different genders. The standard american household is a child of each gender raised to adulthood. We think this is relatively fair. For many parents, though, this simply is not an option. They either have children of the same gender or they keep having children until they get that sort of diversification they want, but then have too many children. Either way, parents are sacrificing part of their future simply because of this sort of random choice. We think that parents deserve the ability to control their own future and we believe that the gender of their child, while having no meaningful effect on the child itself insofar is it is not unjust to be born one gender or another, can have a meaningful effect on the parents. As such, parents should be given greater autonomy and be able to choose the sex of the child. Secondly, though, let's talk about parental efficacy because we think when parents are more passionate about raising a child, when they want to have more diverse experiences, they're usually better parents. If someone has raised only boys for awhile and is, frankly, tired of it, then having a girl might make them a better parent going into the future. We think that this sort of diversification is incredibly good for both parent and child. We would also say that children who have siblings of a different sex are probably more likely to be respectful. They're more likely to empathize with these people and have resources going into the future. Contact is valuable for learning about a number of individuals from different backgrounds and, in this case, different sexes. My third argument is about how this encourages family planning. We think that individuals do not plan regarding having their family enough. When individuals get together and actually discuss what they want to do, when they discuss it with their partner and that becomes normalized, and when they discuss it with a professional, they're far more likely to have a happy future, have a healthy child and, ultimately, empower everyone involved in the raising of the child. To this end, we should legalize sex selection.
We should adopt slow food. Slow food is a culinary movement that began in italy as a reaction against the proliferation of fast food in that country but now has spread globally, and we think that more and more people ought consider the benefits that this has to offer them and their community when they make decisions about how and where to eat. So a bit about what slow food is. Slow food focuses on preparing foods for each individual rather than mass producing foods, on using local and traditional measures rather than industrializing food production, like you'd see at something like mcdonald's, and oftentimes focuses on providing a better quality of food, both in terms of health and also just the the appeal of the food to the consumer. This is something that people can do at home but there are also restaurants that are devoted to the principles of slow food, and this includes many traditional restaurants around the world. So our first argument is that this would be good for promoting regional culture. I read that the beginning of slow food was when mcdonald's was going to open up near the spanish steps in rome, and people were up in arms that such a major site for italian culture was going to have a mcdonald's there. Having been to rome now, I would say that there's a mcdonald's on every corner, but one great thing about the slow food movement is that it gives people an alternative that really captures what that region is about. The slow food that you get in rome is going to be different than what I can get in los angeles, is going to be different than what you can get in tel aviv or kuala lumpur or whatever city you pick. By its nature, it encourages people to cook the way that their parents taught them and to take their time with it, so this encourages people to learn about their local food culture and also to pass it on to their children, something which may not happen if people become more dependent on a sort of globalized, very industrialized type of food production that we sometimes see. So I think that's a major benefit and that this can ultimately be an important tool in preserving local food cultures around the world. And if we've seen anything from this kind of foodie revolution of the last few decades, it's that there absolutely is value to having diverse food cultures around the world and that it's part of what makes different regions special and what gives people their identity. So we think it's something that's worth preserving absolutely. Our second argument is about people's health. When people put a lot of effort into preparing their food and doing things the right way, we think that they're much more aware of what they eat. Nobody is going to just make a cup of soda and put ten tablespoons of sugar into it or whatever is in a cup of pepsi if they can actually see what they're putting into their body. Fast food and processed food have hidden from people how unhealthy our diets are, how full of corn syrup and sodium and all of these other awful things that we wouldn't normally eat our diets have become. But with slow food people are eating the way that people are supposed to. They're eating healthier diets and because of that, people are able to better control their weight and oftentimes live longer and avoid illness. So I think that there's a very real benefit to people's health from the slow food movement. And the last thing that we'd argue is that this can help to build communities. So I think this is distinct from regional food because oftentimes you don't have to be from a region or involved in a region to appreciate their cuisine. One of the great things about the slow food movement in the US has been that we've seen a lot of new fusion cuisines emerge and a lot of new types of food emerge that people wouldn't have seen otherwise, and this has facilitated the development of new communities such as vegetarian and vegan communities around the united states. Whereas previously, because a lot of mass produced food doesn't cater to these groups, it would have been much more difficult to have many people convert over to veganism or vegetarianism, much less to have a community, today we have many restaurants that serve those groups and offer them a place to have a community. So for all of these reasons, we should consider adopting slow food. Thank you.
We should ban whaling. So I want to be clear what we're talking about: we support a total worldwide ban on hunting and killing whales for any reason. So with that in mind we have two large arguments. The first is about ecological considerations surrounding whaling. I think that it's important to understand that some species are more important to their environments than others. These species are called keystone species and most often they are the ones that other species depend upon the most. If you have a large predator, for instance, that consumes huge amounts of biomass and keeps other species population in check, then that's really essential to be sure that those species don't get out of control and ultimately decimate the ecosystem. This is the case with most whales. They are the largest predator in their ecosystem and it's true that they consume things like krill that you or I may not think of as a large species but ultimately in the kind of environments that most whales live in, namely the arctic, these are extremely fragile environments where the whale is the keystone species because they keep the populations of other species in check and at very little risk of high population growth themselves. But we also have another ecological benefit which is a bit more humane which is that they're very charismatic mega fauna, is what people call them. Basically what that means is that little boys and girls around the world love whales. So they care about the environment because of whales. People don't care that much about some arctic shrimp going extinct even though it may be a problem for the environment. What they care a lot about is a great big graceful beautiful creature that is potentially at risk. This means that the whales mean that people are more likely to care about the environment as a whole because they care about one part of the environment. But if whales are hunted to extinction then you lose out on that and these arctic ecosystems lose out on one of the strongest guarantees of their continued existence, namely human investment in their well being, in the form of human concern for wales. So we think that in the long term these environments are much more at risk because of the loss of a keystone species and because people won't care as much about them. And I guess obviously we're concerned about unforeseen harms. I mentioned before that you might see runaway population growth through the shrimp and krill that whale eat but who can say that there won't be other side effects as well that no one can predict right now because we have imperfect information? We just don't think that you should make an irreversible decision like letting whales be hunted possibly to extinction in order to er when you don't have all the good information. Now I bet the other team is going to get up here and say that they can hunt whales responsibly but we just don't think that's true. We think that there is a sort of tragedy of the commons with the open ocean where every single country wants to take as much as they can and give us as little back and that means that every country will always regulate themselves favorably and ignore any international treaty that doesn't suit themselves about whales, like japan is doing, in the status quo when they systematically ignore regulations about whaling. So our second argument then is about the providence of nature. So we think that future people, first of all, have an equal claim to current people to the beauty and goodness of nature. In other words we need to leave the environment the way we found it or better so that future people can enjoy the beauty of nature and the resources of nature. And if we consume them all now they will never come back and we are basically robbing our grandchildren of these incredible creatures and the environments where they live. But aside from that, we'd like to point out that whales tend to live in international waters and that no one country should be able to get rich at the expense of every other country by destroying a valuable resource like the whales. And lastly I'd just like to point out that biological diversity is irreplaceable. Once species go extinct obviously they are never coming back and who can say what uses those species might have to humankind in the future? In terms of research or unforeseen potential benefits to our species. So we see that for instance if people twenty thousand years ago had hunted horses to extinction the course of human history would have been much impoverished. I'm not saying that whales are the next horse, I am merely saying that they could have unforeseen benefits to us that we couldn't even begin to imagine right now. So for these reasons we should ban whaling. Thank you
We should subsidize distance education. So, just to explain what this debate is about, distance education is usually a form of tertiary or university level education in which students are not present directly on a college campus. So in other words, if you were taking a degree in math, you might go to a campus in a city near you twice a year to take exams, but otherwise you would watch lectures online and submit your problem sets over the internet so that a grader at the university could grade them. So people would graduate with accredited degrees from respectable universities, the same universities that they might attend now in person, but they would be able to do all of this from a distance. So with that in mind, we have three arguments for our case today. The first is about a broader reach. Necessarily, there's limited space at a given university. I'm right now on the campus of the university of california at los angeles, and it's a huge university in the middle of an enormous city, one of the largest in the world. But even so, there are so many people in los angeles who can't attend the school because there just isn't space for millions of people or hundreds of thousands of people to attend any one campus. Even some of the largest schools in the world, like the university of toronto, still can't serve everyone in their metropolitan area, simply because there are too many people in a large city who need to go to school. And that's to say nothing of rural people, who don't live near the kind of school that they'd like to attend or any suitable school at all. So on our side, we can reach more people with less space. People can sit in their apartment and learn and watch lectures and read, and then only travel to campus to take exams, or maybe even get them proctored closer to home. For instance, some schools would let you have a librarian or a priest or another respected authority figure proctor your exam, so you don't have to go to the university at all. So with that in mind, we should subsidize distance education so that people have access to a quality of education, no matter how crowded their local university is or no matter how close they live to a university. Our second argument is about nontraditional students. More and more people today change their career at a later age in life. And if you're, say, a mother of two, you're forty years old, and you're deciding to get your college degree, you probably don't have the time to go to campus, even to take night classes. Although obviously night classes are great for letting working people go to school, some people will never be able to have that structured block of time or, as I mentioned earlier, they may just not be able to access the university. So these students, especially older students, are better able to get an education in our world, because they're able to take these classes online whenever it's convenient for them. And as long as they get the work done, they can be guided at their own pace. So we think that this is better, especially for adults returning to education, than having a more structured environment would be. And our last point is that this allows more people to access elite instruction. There's a popular online computer science class taught by a very well-regarded harvard professor. So right now, only a few thousand people get to access the benefits of having a harvard professor, presumably one of the best people at teaching in his field. And if there's a better instructor available at these schools, we, in our world, can offer it to everyone around the country. So thousands of people can take this harvard online compsci class and learn about computer science from one of the best instructors in the country whereas without distance education, only a handful of harvard undergrads are able to benefit from this. And when you subsidize distance education, there's more of an incentive for schools to have their star lecturers create these online courses than there is right now. So in our world, we have a broader reach, we help nontraditional students, and we give everyone access to the best teachers. For all of these reasons, we should subsidize distance education. Thank you.
We should subsidize wikipedia. Wikipedia is a free and open encyclopedia on the internet. It can be edited by basically anyone and, yes, there's a review process. It's not just like those edits will stay without some sort of review by general volunteers that work with wikipedia or wikipedia staff. Wikipedia does not cost a whole lot of money to run despite the fact that it has a huge amount of internet traffic, and it isn't actually profitable given that they don't have ads on the site. We think that in the subsidy we should give a no strings attached full funding for wikipedia's budget, given that it's mostly just server cost and it's simply not very expensive. Okay. First, we want to talk about how wikipedia expands human knowledge. Wikipedia is a truly revolutionary development in human history. It's difficult to understate or it's difficult to overstate overstate the impact that wikipedia's had in spreading the openness of human knowledge. It's an open source of information that's available to access for anyone that has internet access unless there's some sort of country firewall, but it's not a wikipedia firewall that's preventing you from accessing it at that point. It's an amazing resource for people to learn about all branches of human knowledge across cultures and languages. It's unlike any encyclopedia before in that it's not just something that was designed by experts or, you know, put together by a few like a few people or a group of people, and it's not something that's limited by like, you know, a a binding book or a a number of pages. It's something that has articles on almost any topic, any person of note, any field of study, any type of of almost anything that you can imagine, that you would want to have some sort of formalized article about can be found on wikipedia. It's it's a truly remarkable encyclopedia in that sense, and it's impossible to overstate how impactful that can be. For the first time in human history, we compiled information about so many subjects in a way that it can be constantly updated to reflect new information, and it's made available for free with relatively low barriers to entry. It is a true it's a truly immense tool for educating the public. We think this is a clearly good use of subsidy because it's incredibly low cost relative to the to the budget of any developed country, and it's a resource that can benefit all citizens in a wide variety of ways. It's not partisan, it's not biased, it is an open source of information created by the public, and that's the second thing we wanna talk about: communal generation of information. This is revolutionary in a second way. Anyone can edit wikipedia or add new entries. For most of human history, the information that was shared and put in publicized articles and journals and and encyclopedias was dictated by close by closed-off institutions like universities, governments, professional boards, publishers, etcetera. Wikipedia breaks down those barriers and allows a community to arise that make fact-checking possible while still allowing for a free flow of information that's created by the community of the world. All people get to be a part of knowledge generation, not just for some side project, but for one of the most impactful and used encyclopedias on the planet at this point, certainly one of the most used reference sources in human history, and it's not being controlled by some small group of people or some elite group of people. It's being controlled by the people of the world. They get to dictate what knowledge is shared and what knowledge is deemed important for the first time in human history. It returns the keys the keys and language of knowledge to the common people and allows for more information to be spread than ever before possible. For these reasons, we should subsidize wikipedia.
We should ban homeopathy, because it at the end of the day just hurts people, it hurts people because it discourages real treatment, and it discourages access, or seeking out real treatment in place of fake treatment. So, obviously the government should ban them on those grounds. So, let's talk about that: what is a good standard? What should the government be thinking about when it decides if it wants to ban something? There's three things that come to mind for me: first, does this hurt people? Second, are there any benefits that could possibly counterbalance the fact that this hurts people? And third, even if it hurts people, or doesn't help people all that much, is this a choice that people can make accurately and consent into, is there coercion involved, things like that. Am homeopathy has problems with all three of these rather basic paradigms. So, let's go into that a little bit more. So first, as far as the harms are concerned, homeopathy obviously has no real scientific value, but it has harms, in that it could possibly for example, the treatments they are getting themselves can be harmful, you can get more sick as a result of the homeopathic treatment, or at the very least, the homeopathic treatment is happening in absence of scientifically proven treatment, or am actually well tested treatment. So, even if the homeopathy itself doesn't make you less healthy, which it might, it certainly isn't going to make you more healthy, which is net loss if you are sick, because if you're unhealthy that means you're just going to be staying unhealthy, and that's obviously a very big harm. So homeopathy is bad for that. Am, but, additionally there's no benefits to counterbalance this. Maybe if homeopathy was proven to work for some people, am in of itself, that would be worth it, but it's not. There's been extensive scientific testing on this, and there's no real proof that homeopathy actually helps people, any more than a placebo effect otherwise would. So, there's no real reason why we should accept the fact that this does harm people, and we discourage people from getting real treatment. But, the final part about this is about can people make this choice, and I think that this is uniquely bad, because if this is true, then you're essentially seeing people getting coerced into picking a treatment that, we know doesn't work, am and why? And the reason for this is they think because it's cheaper, fake medicine is usually cheaper than real medicine, real medicine costs money to produce, it costs more money to research and develop, it has to go through more extensive testing, there's reasons why medical care is oftentimes expensive. So people may feel, especially if you're financially disadvantaged, you may see this as a viable treatment option, something that could fit your financial needs more so. But that's bad, because I think that the focus should be on enabling access for people for real treatment, it to be enabling access to real treatment, rather than am making it so, that people feel pressured into picking fake treatment, ultimately getting sick and dying anyway. Obviously that's very bad. But don't think that that's obviously something that this would be first choice, I think most people's first choice would be the more accepted in sound medicine, because people want to be healthy, people are going to want to pick those things. Am but, the final thing is that, people also may be coerced into picking this, because it may be easier, oftentimes undergoing, whether it's taking possible cocktails of drugs, that could impact your mind in a different ways, or impact your mood, impact your health, or eating habits, am possibly having to undergo something like like chemotherapy can lead to harmful side effects, amm oftentimes drugs can't get mixed and mashed together very well, there's all kinds of things that can happen. There's all kinds of reasons why homeopathic treatment may strike someone as an easier route to go under, and that's something that people want to believe, on a very basic level, they want to believe that it's going to work, but belief in something working doesn't mean that it's actually going to work, in the same way that believing global warming is a myth doesn't mean that everyone isn't going to be fucked in a few years. So it's very important to recognize this, because this is a perfect scenario for which you should ban something. Homeopathy only hurt people, it doesn't help anyone, and people can't even reasonably pick if this is right for them, because they're probably going to be pressured or coerced into take taking this, because they feel that this is an easier way out of a big problem for them, or even more perniciously, they feel that they can't afford, there's no real affordable option for alternatives, so they see this as cheaper. That's not very good, you need to have better options for people, and in light of that you should ban homeopathy
We should fight nationalism because it is incredibly difficult to critique the state and ultimately try to get better policies when you have a lot of nationalism and additionally because nationalism is immoral and it's something that ought be fought. So let's start by talking about why it is in order to essentially live up to the ideals of democracy in a free society, it's necessary to fight nationalism. And I think that the first reason for this is because when you have an overwhelming sense of nationalism, it ultimately corrupts policy and it corrupts decision making in incredibly profound ways. And I think that the way in which this happens is in that politicians, people who can be like perceived as like strong men or or just individual people, essentially appeal to oftentimes the worst impulses of people. The ideas that we need to preserve particular ways of life, the idea that you need to be greedy and put yourself and your own self interests before others, the idea that descent and critiquing things like the military or police forces are un-american or un-nationalistic, things like this are ultimately incredibly bad because obviously, first and foremost, I think that a lot of them are bad which is basically the second thing we're going to talk about. But also it has a very important impact on suppressing discourse and ultimately denying an ability to really dissent is meaningfully against unjust actions. And this is the case because when you're being labeled as anti-american or anti against against your own people, it becomes more difficult to state your arguments because instead of it becoming a discussion about the issues itself at hand, it becomes a discussion about your identity and a discussion about whether or not you're even like rationally looking for the betterment of society as opposed to some kind of insidious actor that's trying to undercut the the good of your own country. And I think that that's a big problem. But additionally I also think that nationalism is immoral. And I think that it's immoral in a fundamental way in that it's very greedy and exclusive. Nationalism is often predicated on the idea that you need to put the nation and national pride, amongst other things, and that this is a very important thing. And I think that this is a bad thing several fold. First and foremost, I think that national loyalty and identity and things like that aren't things that simply should be owed to a state. You don't owe allegiance to a state. And you ought not. And the reason for that is because it an allegiance should be something that is earned and it's earned on the basis of representing the values of what you think are good. And if a state doesn't do that then you are within your right to go against that and fight against that. And ways that suppress you from doing that are immoral. Additionally, it's an oftentimes incredibly greedy mindset that leads to you messing up a lot of people in a lot of places. It can lead to things like colonialism or imperialism or wars and things like that with the intent of getting your own resources enriched and things like that. It can be seen as exclusionary because you don't want to see a risk to your alleged way of life, or you don't want to let in other people from other countries because you see that as a threat to your own life and things like that. And I think that it creates this kind of false narrative about what the actual impacts are. So for all of those reasons we should fight nationalism.
Athletic scholarships are ways for large organizations to make enormous amount of money on the back of underprivileged people, while taking advantage of those people and giving them almost nothing in return. We are happy to oppose athletic scholarships. One important thing to understand. There is a counterfactual to athletic scholarships, which is not just nothing else. There is an incentive for sporting conglomerates to have young leagues in which people can advance and become better at the sport. In almost every country that is not the united states, these teams and these leagues, the basketball league for example, fund triple-a leagues and double-a leagues and camps where people can practice for years and become better and hone their abilities, in order to funnel the best of the best into the major leagues. This doesn't exist in america because it's replaced, or exist to a much smaller amount, because it's replaced by college athletics. We think at the point at which athletic scholarships are no longer a thing, you get these leagues as a replacement to them. And that we think is the counterfactual to the debate. Let's talk about the harm this creates to the athletes. So the first harm we say, is that these athletes are essentially unpaid, non-unionized labor. They have to work unbelievably hard in order to get better at their sport. They work hours a day in training. Simultaneously, in order to maintain their scholarship, they have to work just enough to maintain a passing GPA as well. So they have additional work on top of this. Now, they'll say on the other side look, they're they're getting paid, they're getting the equivalent of fifty thousand dollars a year or whatever it is that an that a scholarship is worth. Note that this money goes towards a degree which they are unlikely to ever use. Meaning sure, they're getting paid in the form of a good that they receive, but it is a a it is a good that they're unlikely to ever use. Why? A, most of the athletes don't ever end up finishing and getting that degree, because they're either not good enough to maintain an average and therefore get kicked out, or get drafted before they ever finish the degree into the major leagues. Or c, simply drop out when they realize they're never going to be drafted into the major leagues at the point where they're kicked out of the athletic sporting team. Secondly, even those who get their degrees, so a, some of them still focus on sports at which point the degree is unnecessary to them, but b, because they were so focused on their athletic section of their academic education throughout the entire time, their grades are such that they're unlikely to get a job based on that degree, because comparatively they've done less well than other people in this degree. So we think the payment that they get is essentially a non-beneficial payment to them, which means they're basically working for free. Secondly, let's talk about the harm to future potential of these athletes. So, we already started talking about this, but let's get more concrete. If as an athlete I am forced to also focus on my academics, it harms my ability to hone my skills as an athlete. If however, for those few people who aren't actually there for the athletics, but are there because it's their only way into college and they want to be a scholar, we say these people's ability to become scholars is massively harmed by the need to focus on sports. Now, they'll say this is the only way they're getting into college. We say that's not true. If you take away the ability for colleges to meet their affirmative action quotas for example, based on athletic scholarships, you suddenly realize that they actually have to let these people in for other reasons, without forcing them to play sports in order to upkeep their scholarship. So for all these reasons, we say oppose athletic scholarships.
The motion for today's debate is that we should ban casinos. Three main areas of clash, first on why casinos are just a different kind of addiction that ought be banned in the same way that we regulate things like heroin or cocaine or any kind of other addictive drug. Recognize that like chemically and scientifically as it has been studied gambling has been shown to just be as big of an addiction as cigarettes to like cocaine and heroin. The advertisers often specifically put their advertisements in poor areas in this pray on individuals that already don't have very much money and oftentimes like don't have the same kind of indoctrination into why why gambling is so bad and so I think that is like uniquely a way which they take advantage of individuals as well but also we think that it like it brings people in by promising large rewards that never actually occur insofar as people are often set to lose thousands and thousands more dollars than they could ever have potentially gained. The important thing to remember here is that this money trades off with the resources that individuals need for their families. It become like not only are they no longer providing in a financial way but now that they have contracted was essentially an incredibly deadly disease, this is something that the family needs to provide treatment for and support for. This is harmful both to the individual and their like directly related family but it's also really bad for society when rather than like spending your money within your region and like on things that trickle down to other people and stimulate economic activity, you sit in a casino all day and only spend money on like that bracket so that a certain group of people are the only ones who benefit off of it. We think that that's actually quite bad but more than this like bringing us to our second independent point, I think it's important to recognize what kind of behavior casinos actually like encourage and impose. We think a lot of the time what happens is that casinos promote disinhibited behavior that often involve substance abuse especially they bring in like harsher forms of drugs and prostitutes to fuel the behavior that we've already identified can be incredibly problematic. This is bad because it raised the level of crime but it is also bad because it makes the areas more dangerous. The correspondence that occurs there then is that as the like dangerousness in the area rises the prices of the area and like the land and the property become a lot lower which causes more well-off people to leave ie white flight but also forces individuals who do not have the money to leave and just lost a lot of money on their house to be stuck in these awful situations that they can never get out of so we think that's like actually quite bad and so we should never put a city in the position of having to avoid this kind of drainage. But our third independent point is about economic depression because recognize that a lot of the time casinos tend to depress economically the areas surrounding them. This is true because casinos are like a like three-inp-one in that they will often provide a restaurant, they will provide overnight like overnight utilities and overnight beds and entertainment in just one large area. This drives other competing businesses in the region out of business given that no one actually wants to have to leave the casino being inebriated to go get food or to go get other kinds of entertainment and and so this like after and after that occurs in like smaller businesses in the area are driven out because they have a monopoly the casinos can jack up their prices and provide an undue economic influence over the region as a whole. This a problem because it allows things for political lobbying to go through much more quickly if a like certain congressman or whatever thinks that they are a like more likely to lose should do not support this. For these reasons proud to propose.
We should ban human cloning. So we think it's simply the case that there are a massive amount of risks that come with allowing human cloning that come with allowing people to clone themselves or for corporations to clone other people with very little gains that can come from this. Recognize that the process of cloning can still be tested under this model through other animals, that you can still produce organs in a number of ways. In fact, organ production, human organ production is already being done in a number of different ways through a number of different methods that don't involve human cloning. We simply think that is the case that there's no real game. So why do we think that's the case? If you create human agents you should treat that human agent as such. What that means is that if you were to create a clone than that clone should be given the full rights of any other human agent simply by the nature of their humanity. Just because they are a the same genetic makeup of another human being doesn't mean that they can't internalize the harms that will be placed upon them such as that other human being. It doesn't mean that they don't have the right to their own autonomy, their own agency. It doesn't mean that because they're derived from a method other than natural birth that they aren't still a human and deserve the rights that come with that. What this means is that any if you were to create a human clone that human should be created as a new free individual but this is an incredibly costly process and given that the outcome of that costly process would be essentially the same outcome of giving birth we simply don't see any massive benefit to doing this. Maybe there are scientific advancements you can gain but we don't see what scientific advancements you gain particular specifically through human cloning that you wouldn't be able to gain through learning about how cloning works in other organisms and other animals. There's nothing about human biology that is so unique that we couldn't learn or get scientific breakthroughs through other methods of cloning but what you do get is you don't create a new human agent when you do cloning through other species. We think other scientific knowledge knowledge can be gained from cloning animals but we simply don't think the massive cost of cloning a human is worth the outcome of creating a new agent but what we do think is likely to be the case is that if you were to put this cost in people would have some some sort of expectation of that cloned person. We think there are a number of ethical qualms that come with cloning. The first is a property right to a clone. The question of who has property to a cloned individual is something that we think is likely to arise and along with identity problems that come with that clone. The identity problems of the original person and of his clone knowing who they are and being able to relate to the world. We think that that kind of psychological burden is unfair, not to mention the fact that there is now a property claim being contested between the original individual who has been cloned and probably the corporation or the lab that was to clone them. We think there's a potential for organ farms which we think is incredibly problematic because if you were to create this high cost business of cloning human beings, we think it's likely that you'd want some sort of economic return on that and we can a very easy economic return is given the massive shortage in in the need for organ donations, we think organ farms are likely and again this would lead to human agents being stripped of their organs and used as a means to an end. Something that we can see huge ethical problem and something that shouldn't potentially be allowed. We also think there's a potential for human for for humans to have their rights stripped. We think there's a massive potential that no matter what type of economic end you want to retreat from this, that whatever clone is the result of this process is likely going to face massive stigmatization, massive harms to their identity, and ultimately are likely to have their rights stripped to the point in which they are no longer human, but that doesn't mean that these harms wouldn't gather on that person. It doesn't mean that this person this this clone wouldn't internalize the harms of such practices and given that these practices are likely to arise from such a process of human clothing cloning, we think we should cut it off at the head. We think we should ban human cloning to to prevent these things from ever arising and for these reasons, we should ban human cloning.
We should ban cosmetic surgery because of the impact that it has on people's emotional health and the financial costs that it imposes on people as well. So in order to show why we think that these harms are likely to be realized, we're going to first talk to you about how legalized cosmetic surgery leads to an culture in which cosmetic surgery is glorified, and it creates false ideals of beauty, and that ultimately this is what leads to those harms. So how do we so how does cosmetic surgery do this. So we would say that cosmetic surgery oftentimes leads to people changing their body in ways that they otherwise shouldn't. Whether it's models that are like are plastered around on advertisements to look in a certain way, or advertisements that say that you can look better if you get something like a botox or a breast or a breast augmentation surgery. We believe that these kinds of procedures are what leads to an entire culture where ultimately this is the expectation for how you should look. And we believe it is when the a when a culture creates this kind of an expectation for beauty, it means that cosmetic surgery oftentimes is something that people feel pressured into getting, something that they feel that they must get in order to feel wanted, attracted or lovable. So why do we think that this is harmful for people's emotional health. Because first and foremost quite simply, this means that most people are not going to be able to meet a societal ideal of beauty without engaging in these cosmetic surgery. This means that in order for people to feel comfortable in their own skin, they have to go and pay for a procedure. That's obviously something that is not good and something that we shouldn't encourage within a society. But additionally we think that since oftentimes a whole lot of people aren't going to be able to access cosmetic surgery, whether it's for economic reasons, or parental consent reasons, or simply not knowing how to do it, or being afraid of the procedure altogether, this means that a whole lot of people are going to have a low sense of self esteem and a lower sense of self worth, because they're not going to feel like they look the same as people in advertisements, or look like the prettiest people at school, or the most attractive people who are going to look these kinds of ways. So why do we think that this is incredibly problematic. Given that there is honestly a higher prevalence then in a lot of cases for things like depression or other forms of mental illness, we would say that it's incredibly important to make sure that we encourage people to have a healthier outlook on their body and a higher sense of self worth. But this is something that is directly discouraged by a world in which cosmetic surgery is legalized. And the next thing that I want to talk about under this, finally is about the financial cost that this is often going to impose on people. What do we mean by this? So I already talked about how cosmetic surgery leads to a culture in which you're likely going to see people want to pursue this for in order to look better. This is problematic because we think that in a lot of ways these procedures can be quite expensive, they can run up margined cost margins of thousands of dollars. So when people are coerced into spending thousands of dollars on frivolous nonsense, they obviously have less money for other things as well, things that be could be quite important for them like food, support, or other things that can make them happy overall, like vacation time. But we also think that this is quite bad in general, because what this is essentially amounting to is society coercing people in a way so they would'nt spend this money otherwise. Something I think is a real problem. So the final thing that I want to talk about is about how this uniquely harms poor people. Because we think that oftentimes there's a lot of negative stereotypes that fall around poor people, like in america for example poor people are often seen if there in a racialized sense, poor people who are minorities are often seen as more hyper sexualized or more unattractive in certain ways, while poor white people are often made fun of for things like missing teeth or likes like that. We would say that oftentimes this is in many ways contributing to a buyer culture in which cosmetic surgery exists, and the expectations that you're going to look a certain way. And we think that in a lot of ways this creates a distain for certain groups of people in society, a distain which can also ultimately drive policies that we see of far greater importance. So it is for all of those reasons we think that you should ban cosmetic surgery.
We should encourage self-employment. We're not going to get too deep into the specifics of how we're going to encourage this. We think, broadly, that you can do things like give tax breaks or subsidies to people that start a small business, or work as freelancers, or work in some sort of way that they aren't tied to a preexisting corporation or business. A few reasons why we think this is crucial: the first is that automation is leading to a loss of jobs. So, in the near future, automation will be able to do many, many more human jobs than it is currently capable of doing, for example, autonomous driving. As it currently exists, the technology is largely capable to take over the job of every truck driver, taxi driver, uber driver, and transportation service person in the country, in the entire world. The technology is at that level at this point. It's just a matter of regulation and adoption and when that occurs, the single highest employer in the united states will now need to employ, the single highest job will now be simply unemployable. No one will be hiring for truck drivers anymore when you can pay for one truck that is autonomous, that doesn't have to stop for breaks, that doesn't need that doesn't need to be paid any sort of money aside from upkeep. It is just an easy transition to that autonomous opportunity. Where does self-employment come in mind? If we encourage self-employment and if we encourage people to shift away from corporations and shift towards doing things that they are allowed to be their own boss, that they control their employment, it means that fewer people are in this in this job market that is going to be swept up by autonomous by autonomous workers, and will then and it means more people are already in that process of transitioning to a to a post-corporate world, to a world in which you are your own employer, in which you have to have your own business. We think that fewer people in the job market, as far as corporate work, and more people that are under self-employment means fewer people that are impacted by automation in general. We think that self-employment also encourages innovation, which is: one, just good for our society writ large. We think that innovation often leads to technological and social progress, and those are all things we can get behind. But additionally, innovation in services makes it less easy to automate jobs. So if you have self-employment, if you, say, for example, have someone that starts a small business and comes up with a new way of servicing some sort of field, of doing some sort of product, it means that automation can't take hold of that as quickly as it's taking hold of existing sectors of the economy, and it means, again, more jobs available when that autonomous wave comes. But finally, outside of talking about automation, we think that self-employment has various life benefits. First, you get to pick your own hours. You get to choose when and when you when you will and won't work, and it means that you can choose basically how much income you want to take in based on the load that you're doing. It also means that you have an immense amount of latitude over your work. You get to decide what is and is not an important way to spend your time. You get to choose the people that you want to work with and, for example, if you maybe have a customer that you didn't particularly like at your first job, you, at this new job, can just choose not to service them. You have that ability. You can do work that you genuinely enjoy when you've the latitude to decide what that work is going to be and how it's going to be done. We think that self-employment can be incredibly fulfilling and additionally important, it's going to be incredibly important for our transition to a more autonomous economic environment. For these reasons, we should encourage self-employment.
We should lower the drinking age. We should lower it everywhere and we should probably lower it to sixteen, maybe eighteen, definitely below twenty one, and the reason that we should do this is twofold: first and foremost, on a practicality level, as far as sensible regulation of act of drinking, and secondarily as far as rights are concerned. So let's start by talking about responsible usage. I think the first and most important thing to note is that the drinking age is the biggest joke in the entire world and as somebody who is now just who is now twenty one but has nevertheless been drinking for many years now, I think that if you ask just about any person in most countries, certainly in america, they tell you that there's a variety of ways in which an underage person can get alcohol and that the drinking age is entirely unenforced. You can get it from an older friend, you can get it from a lot of parents who don't care because when they were in high school the drinking age was eighteen, you can get it from with a fake ID. Years a whole, there's like an endless flow of ways in which alcohol is just accessible to people. So, given that we operate in a world in which alcohol is going to be accessible to minors and that this isn't going to change because of deeply ingrained social structures that make alcohol a part of our culture, the focus shouldn't be can we get people underage to stop drinking, the focus should be how can we make sure that people who are underage drink responsibly. So I think that the first thing that you want to do is not make people be afraid to call the police or be afraid to call an emergency or like the EMT's if somebody for example drinks too much, or if somebody is possibly getting like sick from drinking too much. And I think that this is a real problem in a lot of like parties and things like that where because there's a real fear of consequences, there's a real fear of getting in trouble, people don't wanna tell the authorities when things got out of hand. So you're less likely, first and foremost, to see partying happen in a responsible way and you're less likely see drinking happen in a responsible way secondarily, when you're not allowed to drink legally you're more likely going to do this in less safe places. The drinking is more likely going to happen in the basement of a fraternity or the basement of like or like or in a high school party, than at a bar or somewhere where it's like public and a lot more able to be regulated. So I think that that's another thing that's incredibly important. But I think it additionally when you have a drinking age, it creates more of an an allure or more of a taboo or more of a glorification around drinking that makes us that people are more likely to over do it, so that people are more likely to use it as an act of rebellion and that people are more likely to essentially drink as like a symbol of independence. A a symbol of having fun in your youth. And I think this is very clearly something that we see right now and it's a big reason why like for example risks of binge drinking or over using too much alcohol are much more prevalent and places in america than they are in more some european countries where it's much more normalized and there's not the same kind of allure. But the final thing that I wanna talk about is right. Because I think that the idea that if your eighteen, or even if you're younger, you're an independent person with autonomy, with agency, with dignity and worth, who can make decisions about their life. Who can decide whether or not it's good or bad for them to have a shot of alcohol, who can decide whether or not it's good for bad for them to have a glass of wine at night. I think this is an incredibly basic decision that the average the average teenager is entirely capable of making. It's not like you're buying a car or something like that, where you're spending tens of thousands of dollars, or in something that's going to affect you for years on end. We're talking about things that are only going to affect you for one night, that aren't ultimately that big of a deal and are perfectly reasonable decisions for people to make. We let people buy like sandwiches. I don't see why alcohol is all that much why it's all that different. Just because something affects your brain does not mean that you shouldn't be able to like use it as long as you can use it responsibly. And the assumption that young people cannot do something responsibly is obscenely ageist to the many responsible young people, and to the many people who simply do not fit into these stereotypes. So for all those reasons we should lower the drinking age.
We should abolish the needle exchange programs. So, we think the principle in this debate is one in which we recognize that the purpose of needle exchange programs is supposed to stop the spread of things like STDs and other viruses that can be spread between addicts, but we think what's important to recognize is that, above all, these are costs that are associated with drug usage, but that the drug usage itself is something that is incredibly detrimental to a person's well-being, and what we mean by this is that heroin usage can ruin one's life in a number of ways, that simply outweigh the possibility that you cut down on sexually transmitted diseases. We actually think you're more likely to get more people doing these types of drugs, doing these types of things, if you even incrementally decrease the risks that are associated with them. So that's what we're going to talk about in this debate. We're going to say that people are more likely to use, and that this outweighs any other considerations and things that may be gained by those needle exchange programs. So, why do we think people are more likely to use? Firstly, you have an infinite access to needles. So as soon as you have one clean useful needle, or any needle that you can find, you're able to get any number of resupply from these programs, which means that in in instances in which people otherwise may not be able to accumulate the equipment to do these drugs, they now have much easier access point to get these types of things, and we think that is incredibly detrimental, because we think that it means that people that otherwise may be forced to quit by their circumstances are going to continue to use, and that's problematic. We also think it obviously reduces the risk of a that are associated with heroin. Things like HIV are are additional incredibly detrimental to one's livelihood. And if you're an individual that's considering using heroin, we think that this is something that may weigh against it. We think that maybe if someone still wants to get the high of heroin, they may go to other drugs that don't have the same types of risks associated to it, but if you decrease the risk of these external diseases, and these diseases have no pleasure associated with them, the reason people are willing to take the risk with heroin is because there is an end gain from that, but there's no end gain from contracting HIV from using heroin. So we think that when you decrease the the likelihood of those types of things, you're more likely to get people to do these things. And finally, we think there's a signaling mechanism associated with this. So, even though needle exchange programs don't overtly say that heroin is okay or that this is something that people should do, when you're willing to increase the ease of access to these types of things, we think it signals to individuals that heroin isn't as bad as you otherwise signal, and you keep laws as stringent and as strict, and you don't institute these policies, and signaling is crucial. When government and society sends a message to people, especially the people that are vulnerable or on the edge, or those that are most likely to consider using heroin, when you send those types of signals to people, it has a real impact on their psychology and a real impact on their behavior. And we think that evens and marginally increasing the potential for people to choose to use heroin, because they think it's not as bad as they otherwise would believe. Again, the risks associated with heroin usage, the likelihood of overdosing, the likelihood of addiction, the things that in heroin are much worse than in any other drug, we think that those things cannot be tolerated and cannot be allowed within our society. Even though needle exchange programs may decrease the risk of other types of illnesses associated with heroin, we think that those are risks that people are able to recognize when they choose to do this drug, and are crucial in getting people to avoid using heroin in the first place, which we think should be the end goal and should be a major goal of society to avoid drug addiction and drug use, especially when it comes to heroin. And for these reasons, we should abolish the needle exchange program.
We should ban organic food. So in the status quo, in places like the united states and the european union you have government entities that label some food which is produced according to a long list of guidelines as organic. So the only way that you're allowed to call your food organic is if you go down the sort of government checklist and meet every requirement and they presumably test your food to ensure that you do so. So what we're arguing for on our side of debate is to get rid of this official label of organic for any given food. Instead, we think that consumers should be able to read if something is produced according to certain natural methods, but that the actual term organic should not be used. And certainly, nothing should replace it that's a similar government label that's indicative of this type of quality. So three arguments. The first is about why we think that organic labels drive up food costs. So we tell you that it's much more lucrative to sell food to people who have more disposable income rather than less. We see that, for instance, there are probably people in san francisco who can afford to pay a lot of money for a bag of rice, and people living in oakland who can pay a lot less money for a bag of rice, so you would always want to be the person producing for those wealthier consumers. Now, the organic label is an excellent way to get someone to pay more money for effectively the same product. We tell you that going down this checklist doesn't actually mean that you've done that much differently, just that you've avoided certain chemicals and likely substituted in other chemicals instead. This may sound a little bit cynical, but most organic food is not coming straight from, you know, your grandfather's farm, it's coming from a massive agribusiness that's just as manipulative is any other food company so we tell you that because it's more lucrative you get fewer alternatives, because stores also want to stock the most profitable foods, which means these organic foods. So they're taking up space that would otherwise go to regular, cheaper foods. At that point I think that you get higher prices for the same foods, and that this is unacceptable because this makes it more difficult for people to have food security in their community. Our second argument is about why we think this label is fundamentally misleading, and I suppose I've already hinted at this a little bit. So there are no proven health benefits to so called organic food, and this makes a lot of sense when you think about what it actually is. The USTA in america, or the EC in europe, basically just say you can't use any chemical on this list, and you have a few other requirements for how you store and treat this food. So it doesn't make any sense that it would have any health benefits given that you're effectively eating the same thing minus a few safe chemicals that have already been approved for use in food these foods have the same nutritional value. Now, it might be the case that one farmer has a strain of tomato with a little bit more vitamin a than another farmer strain of tomato, but at the end of the day these differences are insignificant when you account for the natural variation between foods because they're a product of nature. We think therefore that this label is misleading because it exists to mislead consumers. Basically, the companies that produce this organic food, these large companies like tyson and other agribusinesses, are implying to customers that organic food is healthier and more nutritious. And even if they don't lie in their advertising, this seems apparent based on how people understand the word organic. So we think that there's an imbalance in access to information between consumers and companies. The companies know that the food is the same nutritionally as any other food, but the consumer thinks that they're getting something better. At that point we feel like the government needs to step in and ban the use of this label because consumers are effectively being taken advantage of and can't protect themselves from these predatory businesses. Our last argument is about why we think that the organic food label is actually harmful to small farmers. So because this list is pretty long and requires you to use more expensive chemicals to grow your plants, or to raise livestock in particular, we think that most small farmers actually can't afford to meet these sort of arbitrary regulations for the organic label. What is that mean? Now, they can't compete in the gourmet food market, which we already told you is the most profitable food market, but on top of that, we think that they're likely to lose customers because people who probably would have bought produce at things like farmers markets and other places are now going to turn to other markets buying from large companies in order to get organic products thinking that it's healthier. We think that many small farms will likely go under as they lose their consumer base, which is people with enough disposable income to buy from a small farm in the first place. And this only strengthens and entrenches the power of large businesses. And we think that this makes it likely that there will be less competition in the sphere of food production in the long run which ties back into what I told you earlier about driving up costs due to lack of competition. So for these reasons, we should ban organic food.
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offense. Assisted suicide is ultimately suicide. It is the taking of a life without fully being able to understand the ramifications of such action. Even when there are incredible checks in place which guarantee that individuals without mental illnesses and who are simply, who are not simply depressed, are unable to access assisted suicide, we still think that it is problematic. Even in cases of terminal patients, even when individuals have ruminated on the implications for a considerable amount of time, assisted suicide will fundamentally destroy their access to rights and pushes the barriers of consent far beyond what we should allow as a government. To that end, we have two arguments for why assisted suicide should be should be a criminal offense in every single state. First, on the limits of consent: no individual can see the future. No one can understand when their suffering will or if they will be alleviated of the problems that currently are pushing them towards assisted suicide. We believe that taking your own life is a horrible thing to do. It doesn't make you a horrible person but, ultimately, in the grand scheme of things, the action itself is incredibly bad and should be avoided at all costs. We believe that assisted suicide, the taking of someone else's life with their consent, is ultimately a harm to their future self. Individuals are not necessarily continuous. We exist each instant and are able to appreciate our world as we take in the stimuli at that moment. However, assisted suicide or suicide at all ultimately destroys your future self. It is ultimately revoking the consent of any future actions and any future thought to such an extent that individuals lose all rights. This brings me to my second argument: why causing death is inherently unjust and should be avoided in any situation. We believe that life is a fundamental right. It is impossible to contract away fundamental rights. We would say that someone who signed a contract that says, " I will never engage in political speech again. I will never vote again. I sign away my rights to ever have privacy, " would ultimately be absurd. We would not allow that as a people or as a government. However, allowing someone to have their life taken away is doing just that. We believe that life is a facilitative right to political efficacy, to speech, to assembly, to engagement with the world. However, allowing individuals to take that right away ultimately diminishes the value of human life in general. Even if it's not the case that individuals should not be allowed to have assisted suicide, we think it's important for governments to signal that assisted suicide should not be an option. When government wholeheartedly wholesale support suicide as a potential alleviation of suffering, we think that's when individuals start to take their lives with more regular occurrences. That's when individuals feel even more abandoned, when the government is willing to put money into assisted suicide but not into mental health rehabilitation and support. Because we think assisted suicide is inherently problematic but is especially problematic when recognized by governments, assisted suicide should be a criminal offense.
We should fight for tibetan independence. First, I want to be clear about what we mean by like, because I don't necessarily think that conceptualized violent resistance, or an attempt to violently overthrow chinese autonomy in the region. I think that we should fight for tibetan independence via non violent means, things like economic boycotts, divestments and sanctions, supporting these things on a global scale as well, and I also think that, you should engage in maybe acts of political and civil disobedience, but the focus should always be on it being non violent in nature, and I think that this is very important on a strategic level, as far as actually getting support and sympathy in the international community, and therefore increasing your chance to actually ratchet up enough pressure on china, that they're willing to make concessions. So, first I want to start by talking about, why I think that it's so blatantly obvious that the tibetan people deserve their independence, and that the fact that they're not currently achieving it is a travesty. So, first, I think that they just have an affirmative right to make their own choices. Keep in mind that, they have a distinct language, they have a distinct religion, they have a distinct culture, they're far away geographically from like beijing, they're like they're not even really all that close, they have distinct economy, they're distinct in like a ton of ways, way more distinct than anywhere else in a lot of other countries would be. So, this is all important because, all of the political decisions that get made in your day to day life, in order for them to be, I think, legitimate, you have to be able to have some degree of say over them, and it's very clear that the tibetan people right now don't have this, and that's a right that's being deprived of them. But I think that, secondarily, there's also almost like a negative conception, where like even if the tibetan people didn't, in theory, deserve independence, the fact that china is is oppressing, committing human rights violations, against people in tibet, is, I think, in a like a negative right sense, like they have lost their right to sovereignty over them, they have lost their right to govern over them, because they've abused that right, and they've abused the tibetan people, and therefore the tibetan people need to, in order to protect themselves, be responsible for their own governance. But I think on the flip side, I think that when you fight for independence, you're still going to achieve a lot of good for the average tibetan person's life, and the reason for it is this, I don't necessarily think that, certainly not right away, you're actually going to be able to get independence, if you start fighting more so for independence, much more aggressively, but I do think that this is important strategically, for increasing the rights and autonomy of the average person, and here is why: while china may not be willing to give up entire independence, if enough economic pressure is growing, if enough political pressure is growing on china, because china is not some independent actor that can isolate itself from from political impacts of the world, because it's dependent on the united states purchasing and things like that, they ultimately have to listen, if there's enough pressure. So I think that, china would be very willing to make concessions, to not make as many human rights violations, to give more autonomy, if not outright independence, and I think that this would start to be seen as a reasonable middle ground, between the status quo and independence. While the alternative reality would be, if you're not fighting for independence, out of fear that that could lead to more crackdowns, or fear that that could make the situation worse, then ultimately you're just not going to see a change to the status quo. So I think for all of those reasons, it's very important to fight for tibetan independence.
I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion, that we should ban lotteries. The model here is pretty intuitive: we would just say that governments ought not, even at the state and local levels, have any sort of government sanctioned lottery. Given that the scope of the info slide specifically regards state run lotteries, I think it is completely fair to say that we are fine with private lotteries, and things like casinos continuing onward, we would just say that government sponsored lotteries are a bad thing, and should be abolished. So, three independent points of analysis under this: first, we would say that this facilitates gambling addictions, and that that's a bad thing. Second, we would say that there is a disparate impact on poor individuals in the society. And third, we would say it is a bad form of revenue raising for the government. So, first argument, that it facilitates gambling addiction. I think it's pretty intuitive as to why this is true, right? Like, you have like not just a large pot to be won, so like people with the most significant incentive to gamble, in the most serious addictions, are going to be drawn to this pool, insofar as it is like the biggest shiniest pool, you have a multi billion, or multimillion dollar pool sometimes, that are extremely attractive, and because of just the scale of the lottery, you're always going to beat out whatever the private casino or whatever might promise, but we would say that, that is problematic right? Addiction itself is a bad thing, we don't want to facilitate addiction, but we also think that when the state becomes involved in the gambling industry, and becomes a significant actor, that has a financial stake in ensuring that these people these likes quote unquote whales keep coming back to use the gambling services, that's when you like, erode at the actual state infrastructure, that is designed to help these people that are in need. The state now has a financial incentive to overlook its moral obligation to assist those that are suffering from severe gambling addictions. Likewise community members, that are profiting off of these lotteries, like shop owners, also have an incentive to turn a blind eye. So, we think it is necessarily problematic, then, when you create a structure, that uniquely puts the state in a position to overlook this extreme form of suffering. My second independent point, that poor people are disparately harmed by the lottery is also fairly intuitive. Rich people don't need to gamble, because gambling is something that, generally speaking, people start doing because they believe that it will get them to riches. These are generally people that are the most destitute within society, that have the least to lose, and as a result, are the most likely to engage in what is an inherently irrational behavior. Lotteries are built on the assumption that they will bring in more money than they will put out, that is to say, that your probability of winning is significantly low enough, sufficiently low enough, that that would dilute out the expected winnings, weighed against your percentage probability of winning the lottery. So it is an a rational behavior, that is generally fueled by a need to rise up in society, that is not felt by those that are already doing well. So, we would say this is a bad policy, or this is a bad thing to have at the status quo, because it perpetuates the inequality that is systemic to lotteries. My third independent point is that this is a bad way to raise revenue. So, we would say that, generally, the argument that side government is going to make is something to the effect of like: but we increased state coffers, we put this money towards like education, or welfare, or whatever thing that the government does that you enjoy. The problem with this is that presumably, the services that you think we really need, that are historically underfunded, are the ones that go to the poor. Things like funding for homeless programs, or funding for job training, or welfare, or whatever, right? But the problem is that, at the point where you're taking the money from the people that are worse off in society, this reasoning doesn't make sense. It's a regressive tax, because you're just taking from the poor, and then giving some of that money back to the poor people, that needed it the first place. We would say that this is inherently irrational way of raising the money, that is necessary to provide these important social services. Proud to propose.
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned. So by this we mean that the catholic church, which for centuries now has required that priests be celibate, should give up this requirement. So priests ought be allowed to marry and have sexual intercourse, the same as any other married adult in the catholic faith. We don't want this debate to be about the theological implications of the vow of celibacy. We're just going to say that orthodox priests and protestant priests and even certain rights of catholicism, aside from roman catholicism, these or christian groups allow their priests to marry, so we see that clearly there is some religious ground for this practice to be allowed. But with that aside, we want to get into two major arguments of this debate that we think will be more accessible. The first is that the vow of celibacy dissuades young men from joining the priesthood. So we see that because of the vow of celibacy, many young men who might be deeply religious, who might be very attracted to life in the church, are likely to turn to secular occupations instead. Indeed, this is one of the reasons why we think there may originally had been a vow of celibacy was to sort of weed out those of lesser faith. But we think that a result of this is that many of the most qualified candidates will choose not to join the church. Imagine that you had a hundred young men in the city of boston every year who are interested in becoming priests, and fifty of them are, you know, intelligent, driven young men who you would want to become priests, but only twenty five out of the total group are willing to take this vow of celibacy. Half who are the kind of competent people that we want and half who are incompetent. We see that if you have a certain demand for, say, thirty priests that year, that you will have to take some of the incompetent men, whereas if you got rid of this requirement, you would only take the confident young men. We think that although obviously these numbers are made up, you can see that you're more likely to get incompetent priests as a result of the vow of celibacy, and you're likely to have young men who could otherwise have served the church in a very fruitful, useful and personally fulfilling way, turn to other occupations in its stead. We think that the church suffers when there is comparatively poor leadership. That you would be able to reach out to more people through evangelism, that you would be able to better care for current members of your parish, that you would be able to fill positions which have gone empty, there are many parishes around the world which don't have a priest because there's a shortage of capable priests. We think that all of these harms could be avoided by simply removing the vow of celibacy. Our second argument is about how we think that this is a law made to be broken. What do we mean by this? We think that it's very difficult for any young person, most people become a priest when they're fairly young, to really weigh what this means over the course of their lifetime. You know, a young person who is a virgin may not fully understand the implications of what they are signing up for when they choose to take this vow of celibacy, which means that it's quite likely that they'll eventually break their vow. We think that this has several major harms. One, is that it means that people who were doing a pretty good job as a priest otherwise will be removed from their parish and sent off to be isolated from the public, because that's generally what happens when priests break their vows, which means that they won't be helping people, they won't be reaching out to those who need them, their talents will go to waste. And on top of that, that optically it makes the church look hypocritical if priests are violating their vows. So we think that this will turn many people, especially young people, away from the church, because they think that the leadership of the church is not living up to the same standards that ordinary people are expected to in terms of maintaining vows. So ultimately we think that because this is such a difficult vow to keep, it has many harms to the church in terms of its personnel and its public perception. So for these reasons, the vow of celibacy ought to be abandoned. Thank you.
Blood donation should be mandatory. On our side, we're arguing that people who are safely able to give blood, such as healthy adults and people who don't have any transmissible disease, should be required to donate blood if there is a shortage of blood in your country. So we're not saying that everyone is going to have to go in every monday morning and donate a pint of blood but, for instance, after a natural disaster, when there is a huge demand for blood donations, we would be okay with requiring healthy people to donate. A good example of this might be after the terrible hurricane that hit puerto rico last year. We would be fine with requiring healthy puerto ricans to donate blood, if they're able, so that we have enough blood to supply all of the people in need after that terrible disaster. With that in mind, we have two main arguments: the first is that from a utilitarian perspective, this is obviously ethical, and the second is about how this ends shortages. So what do we mean about why this is ethical? We would tell you that when you're making a decision about whether something is the right thing to do, you need to weigh the costs to different groups of people. We would say that the harm to someone of not getting blood when they need it is so great that we're willing to ignore people's right to choose how to use their body in order to prevent that from happening. We're not going to deny that this is an imposition on personal freedom, rather we're going to say that if you compare the enormous harm of someone who has a rare blood type or who just needs blood in general not being able to get that transfusion versus the relatively minor cost of having to give up a pint of blood and maybe drink a little bit of extra water that day, it's clear that we should defer to the person whose life is at risk rather than the healthy person, whose time is at risk. Now, they other side might see that some people have religious objections or that some people are just very uncomfortable with needles but, again, I think it's clear that saving people's lives, especially in a time of extreme need, is much more important than any other freedom. After all, the right to life must precede any other rights that people have. You would have no way to access your right to freedom of religion or bodily autonomy if you aren't alive. So we think that this is the most basic right that governments need to preserve. And if there is a demand that isn't being met, we think that it's necessary for the government to step in and correct this failing of the market by requiring that people donate. Our second argument is about how this uniquely ends shortages. Blood donation tends to be something that people do a few times a year when their office or their school has a blood drive. Many times this happens around the holidays. The problem with that is that blood, apparently, doesn't remain stable very long. You have to constantly be replenishing the supply of blood available to hospitals in your country. In a huge country like the united states, this might be something that people can do easily, but in a relatively small country like, say, switzerland, there might be many fewer people donating at any given time so that, if god forbid, there should be a disaster, there wouldn't be enough blood on hand, even if people were donating a little bit throughout the year. The only way to deal with this sudden demand is to have a sudden increase in supply as well. And while it's true that many generous people might go out and donate blood of their own volition, what we're talking about is what happens when people aren't donating enough blood. After all, if there was no need for this, it wouldn't be implemented. So we think that given that there's this sudden surge of demand, the only way to end the shortage is going to be to require people to donate. The other side might say you could import blood from other countries, but that probably isn't an option for many poorer countries and, also, sometimes isn't practical, because you have immediate need. On our side, we've explained to you why this is ethical, why it's necessary and, also, how we uniquely stop shortages in the blood supply when it's most needed. For all these reasons, blood donation should be mandatory. Thank you.
We should end mandatory retirement. So in this debate we have two main arguments. The first is about why age based restrictions are essentially problematic, and the secondly is about why it's unfair to workers. So firstly on age based restrictions. It's important to recognize that age is always an arbitrary line. You cannot simply say that all sixty five year olds have certain capabilities and all forty five year olds have certain qualifications and that this is always a universal truth. That is simply not the case that age is a good approximation for other types of qualities, which means if you set an arbitrary line at when at which someone needs to retire, we think that you're judging all people based on a stereotype and based on a metric that is simply untrue. We think that arbitrary delineations should not be a part of public policy and that rather other metrics are preferable. And that's the second thing that is important to recognize, is that age in these types of discussions is always just an approximation for something else. In this case, it's an approximation for competency and about an approximation of skill, about whether or not someone is actually qualified and capable of serving in their role. But you can still test for those things in a market that doesn't have mandatory retirement. Businesses can still phase out workers once they become no longer productive enough to meet bare minimum requirements of a labor and you can still create competitions in the workplace to ensure that people that are no longer skilled cannot serve in the role. But to say that at age sixty five, or whatever age you set, all people lose the ability to produce and to be effective laborers we think is simply a stereotype and nonsensical. Yes it is probably true that there are some people that once they hit a certain age are not capable of being productive workers. But mandatory retirement phases out skilled workers in addition to unskilled workers. It ends up being a net loss to corporations when otherwise you could simply phase out those that are unskilled and allow those that are still quality employees to work. We think that you're lessening your labor base and you remove qualified and knowledgeable workers and replace them with workers that are less familiar with the job, less familiar with the company, people that don't have the experience to do the job in the same quality way that people with vast experience those that are retiring are likely going to be able to do. Alright secondly on why this is unfair to workers. We think that there are two possibilities of these mandatory retirees. The first is that they still need money. They simply don't have the funds to retire and they still need to work. Well when you force mandatory retirement on them their skills are often nontransferable so they can't just go to another corporation because they have to compete with the younger workforce that otherwise is going to that is going to provide more long term assets to a company and is a better investment for training and things like that. And oftentimes these people simply don't have the assets to go and acquire new training which means that people that need to work end up being forced into low skilled labor jobs which I think is an inefficient use of their experience, their knowledge, and their worldly time that they spent in any sort of corporate or other job position that they're being forced out of. We think that this is unfair to workers and we think that if you need to maintain yourself in a job, if you need to continue to work and you have the skill to do so, you should be allowed to do so. Finally, it is also possibly the case that you don't need to work but because you've been working in a job for so long, your job provides you with meaningful fulfillment. Again in these cases if you are qualified enough to work, we think it is unfair and irresponsible to strip these people of something that provides them with such fulfillment as a job that they've been invested in for many, many years. Because age based restrictions are arbitrary and because there are legitimate reasons people may still want to work, we should end mandatory retirement.
We should abandon television. No forms of technology has inspired as much laziness as the television. Since the nineteen twenties individuals have plopped themselves in front of television and watched it for hours on end leading to a far more sedentary lifestyle and far greater disease among society as a whole. Because we believe television leads to a system which causes obesity and heart disease as well as a system which caters to problematic niches we believe that we should abandon television. The model that we propose to do this is that individuals should simply stop watching television. It's not as though the government should intervene and actively ban television rather that individuals of their own volition should choose to stop watching this foolish form of technology. Two arguments to support this motion. First that it is unhealthy and second that it leads to problematic niches. First on healthiness. Television as a system is dedicated to keeping people in front of it. Channels use their ads in strategic ways putting cliffhangers in putting shows in that require individuals to sit for a long amount of time in order to get more ads in front of them and as such it's led to people going outside less and interacting with their family less. Although we think things like phones and laptops will largely take individuals away from their family in equal amounts as television we think television is unique in the its inability to move around which we think is incredibly problematic. It leads to far greater obesity and heart disease as individuals choose to watch television rather than going outside. We believe this is a clear tradeoff given that entertainment is largely zero sum the time spent. And when individuals have fewer choices and further incentive to go outside and see what's happening they will generally take other options. Furthermore when the strategies of television are not being used on them then it does not require constant viewing to actually keep up with a certain show they'll be more willing to go outside and be happy there and we think that individuals are incredibly bad at making long term decisions and as such the government assuming that the government but individuals will not take this option unless there is some some form of fiat as we state in the model. My second argument though is that television creates problematic niches. First off on entertainment. We think entertainment in the status quo depends on carving out a small but loyal niche. This mean shows like big brother can be racist sexist and generally fratboyish in order to attract that crowd and will never face meaningful scrutiny. The niches that are created exist all over. In the far left in the far right particular shows only cater to a certain crowd and as such there's no empathy between these crowds. We think this effect is even more problematic however with news. Print media with a particular number of main sources leads to general moderation. We think the new york times could publish something that's far left or far right before and generally have a discussion between individuals from different political fields. However with thousands of channels on the air and requiring only a small consumer base new shows are able to attract a particular crowd and continue catering them in an incredibly problematic way. Where the most effective news channels at gaining a large audience and making money has been fox news which is dedicated to misinformation and far right pundints stating their ideas. At the same time far left pundits can also create echo chambers which are incredibly problematic. This leads to division and inability to create effective policy in the long term due to the sort of new shows and generally leads to the election of fascists from a particular area such as trump which we think is incredibly problematic. Because of these harms we should abandon television.
We should protect whistleblowers. Whistleblowers are a key resource for many journalists who want to uncover dirt or shed light on corruption in powerful systems in our society. Because the most powerful organizations take incredible means to hide information and to punish those who leak it, when individuals face incredible harm they're unlikely to come forward with the truth. Even when corporations are destroying the environment, incredibly oppressive towards the global poor, or just generally problematic in terms of their workplace culture if they bring the hammer down on whistleblowers, whistleblowers simply will not exist. Because we want to make whistleblowers feel more secure and because we do not think whistleblowers should have to incur incredible harm to protect the public, we would propose the following model: the government to be unable to subpoena journalists for sources that corporations be unable to take libel policies and slander policies against journalists who are quoting anonymous sources if the corporation cannot prove that the individual accusations are untrue. We think that the only case and in which whistleblowers can be charged is if a corporation can positively prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they themselves are not conducting the harms in the accusation. Three arguments for why this is a good idea. First on the responsibility of government. We think it is unjust to punish individuals for doing the right thing. Our criminal justice system depends on individuals only being punished when they cause a harm to the whole of society. Law is how individuals speak in a political system. When laws are undermined or when individuals do not are not aware of laws being undermined they are being harmed. Whistleblowers do the opposite. They empower the criminal justice system and yet they're regularly targeted to the fullest extent of the law. This policy would protect them and guarantee that we do not take unjust action against them. We think government has an obligation to do this as it is the only one who can reform the criminal justice system. My second argument is regarding the value of this kind of knowledge. We think that when individuals do not know the perverse incentives and harms of government, they cannot vote in a meaningful sense. If I do not know the worst thing a candidate has done, I am far more likely to vote for them even though I should not be doing so. This undermine the right to political efficacy and destroys the democratic efficacy of our government. We'd further say that individuals cannot conduct their daily life if they don't know the harms against them. They don't know where to invest if they don't know which corporations are abusive. They don't know which purchases they want to engage with if a corporation deserves to be boycotted yet no one knows what they're doing. At the end of the day, the market is a democratic institution. It allows individuals to place their resources where they can gain the most utility possible. By decreasing this the access this information we guarantee that corporations increase the externalities upon the public and generally make the quality of life for all individuals worse. This brings me to my third and final argument -bout how whistleblowers deter corruption. When there is no way to check if a corporation is doing a bad thing, they will always do the worst thing possible. In a free market economy any chance to get a benefit will be taken. Any chance to get a leg up on your competitors will be taken. This means that without proper coverage, corporations will inevitably destroy the environment and oppress their own workers. Whistleblowers are important because they deter that corruption. They increase the total risk involved with acting problematically towards the world and as such, are far more likely to deter corruption not only for corporations but for politicians too as they do not want to be voted out of office. For this reason, we should protect whistleblowers.
Surrogates you should be banned because of the harmful impacts that it has on women. It has the course of nature of a surrogacy contract and secondarily, it's bad because it deters people who can't conceive normally who are going to be using surrogacy. It deters them from adopting and that's just a much more preferable option that they should be doing anyway. So let's start by talking about the course of nature of this and I think that this is really important because when you're agreeing to be a surrogate for somebody you are necessarily going to be in a pretty vulnerable position. You are going to have a lot of like your like fundamental aspects of like your like lifestyle are going to change as a result of being pregnant, and that's because pregnancy exerts a substantial burden on women. It's a substantial burden to be pregnant. So I think that when you're going to try to create almost an occupation of people doing this, this is going to be incredibly bad. It's going to coerce people to have just like keep having babies for other people at the expense of getting other more like lasting jobs which I think is not very good. I also think that additionally it's important to talk about how this is going to deter people from adopting and that's just more moral option. So why are why do people typically request a surrogate or try to get a surrogate? It's because they might not be able to conceive themselves. So I think that there's a problem here because I think that it's quite clear that adopting is probably the more moral option than naturally conceiving and the reason for this is because when you talk about people who are in adoption they're oftentimes incredibly disadvantaged. They have a lot less support. They can be in like overcrowded and underfunded foster care systems. They're not going to get the individual attention and support that they need to like oftentimes succeed in life, and there's oftentimes just too many of them, and I think that this is important because when you conceive naturally instead you're contributing to this problem. So when you use so instead of having a surrogate you could adopt and therefore you can keep incentivize people to do that. The final thing that I want to talk about is that I often think that this is going to be not necessarily the safest thing, and I think that oftentimes this is done in like cause it's very difficult to enforce. It's very difficult to regulate this constantly. It can often times be dangerous because pregnancy can lead to complications for women. It could lead to complications for the mother. It could lead to some health problems and that's important because I think that that's something that is like a hazard enough reason that we don't need to allow people to do that. So for all of those reasons very proud to propose this ban.
I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should fight nationalism. In terms of the model this is you know something sort of broad but generally we would say that we want to you know take steps to combat the ideology of nationalism. So maybe that means public discourse, you know maybe that means you know simply endorsing viewpoints that run directly counter to nationalism such as multiculturalism, but the main take away here is that we want to actively dispel this ideology in the public discoursing in the public mind. Three independent points. The first being that nationalism is a huge driver of international and even internal conflict. Nationalism at its core contends that a certain group of people is inherently preferable to another group of people. This is often disguised as a sense of pride or you know civic pride or whatever but this is broadly always going to be something that people will look at and use as an excuse to justify their superiority. Everything from something as you know harmless as like a preference of a sports team in the olympics all the way up to you know actual acts of genocide and warfare are justified to this ideology. And the significantly less harmless ones where people you know actually engage in international violence those are worth mitigating to a severe extent and we think that even if there are benefits on you know domestic level to having nationalism as a coalescing force we think that that the scope of international conflict a serious suffering that it creates is worth getting rid of and we think that that's always going to be a more significant weighing point. Our second independent point is that this drives xenophobia. So specifically what I mean is the admission of people from other countries into your country you know with migrants with refugees with just immigration in general this is a mitigating force. We think that necessarily immigration is important people you know that are in other countries are often suffering at the hands of some sort of you know malady hardship or dictator within that country and it is obviously preferable for them to be in a country where they're not experiencing that hardship. However you know the united states is a prime example of this. There's often a sense of nationalism, a sense of individual pride in one's own country that precludes the in the you know the admission of people from other locations and as a result people are left to suffer in countries that cannot properly provide for them by virtue of other people's nationalism. We think that fundamentally this is an extreme problem and that we should you know mitigate basically the the ideology that justifies this. Our third independent point is that there is an internal purity test that that is associated with nationalism on a domestic level that then justifies significant amounts of oppression and acts of violence. So what I mean by this is that when you look to again using the united states is an example a a large part of you know discrimination against citizens who are black or latino for example is often rooted in the sense that they're not real americans that you know people from the midwest largely white largely rural consider themselves you know the real america and this at its core is nationalism. This is a sense that you know america is you know preferable to other countries and that you represent the true america. This is a problem then because it's often used to justify acts of violence and oppression against these minority communities who you know from a citizenship perspective are no less american than anybody else but they just don't fit into a particular subculture within that country that has been declared to be the true america. This is a problem obviously. It results in acts of violence, it results in you know housing discrimination, everything from you know small stuff like interpersonal interactions all the way up to you to you know large scale government policies that actively discriminate against these groups. At that point then we think the ideology that justifies this should be actively combated. Proud to propose.
