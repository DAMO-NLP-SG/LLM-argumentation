We should further exploit wind power	The lithium ion batteries are becoming more and more sophisticated, which means that the cost curve for producing solar power is much lower than that of wind power it's simply a more affect of way of storing and holding energy and it's more applicable to smaller scale
We should ban cosmetic surgery	I think it misses the fundamental point that the problem with cosmetic surgery isn't the act of getting cosmetic surgery, it's generally speaking the norm that there is a a specific beauty standard that individuals must be held to and beat the even broader standard that armed men in general get to dictate beauty standards that women than conform to I don't think banning cosmetic surgery, sold these big macro issues at the end of the day misogyny is a quite flexible weapon, and I don't think that banning cosmetic surgery is going to have much of an impact
We should adopt libertarianism	Most recently in the financial sector, with two thousand the two thousand eight financial crisis
We should lower the age of consent	So if a seventeen year old has sacked sixteen year old brother had sex with like an eighteen year old or a nineteen year old that's already legal in most states, I think the difference that's being established onsite government is just how low you push the bar you're, not getting rid of the greys own arm on our side of the house
