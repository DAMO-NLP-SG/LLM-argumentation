We should adopt libertarianism	And I think that what the fines libertarianism most is our it's extremism in a way in which it values concepts like ownership
Bullfighting should be banned	We should respect those wishes and respect those preferences, our third and final independent point is that making bull fighting a legal because it is so heavily demanded will simply result in underground bullfighting and analogous example in much of central america, and even in spain itself is cock fighting where instead of having the sort of like open available on and regulated cock fights pull up bullfighting would simply become something like what cock fighting is today
We should ban anonymous posts	And being able to post anonymously, brings a kind of shield your identity, and it makes it more likely that you could be willing to engage and express your thoughts in the first place
We should legalize cannabis	And thus the health harms to marijuana will be significantly down played in a way that precludes informed consent
We should lower the drinking age	That is that the age of majority isn't often not designed in such a way that it is like by each team, you will be mature enough to do a lot of these things
We should disband ASEAN	Thirdly, alice says there's imbalance in ACA, and some of the countries are rich, some of them are poor, and that creates tensions
Sex education should be mandatory	They think that parents shouldn't be the ones that educate children on sex why because they're no experts on sex education being are not an expert on how to use contraception or in STV's now that might be true, but we really don't think that the critical part really needs to be explaining the biology behind STV's or behind getting pregnant or whatever come on
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	So under the first argument that there is a better stability in a world with a veto power it's important to recognize that it ensures that nothing passes that would initiate major conflict with the US
We should adopt libertarianism	The reason why is that in a libertarian state large companies like exxon and amazon can largely do is they will with no oversight from the american people, no it's true that these companies are governed democratically to the extent that shareholders get to vote, but that really just means that it's a democracy for the very wealthy who can afford to buy the shares and get on to boards essentially its return to government by the super wealthy elite like what you saw in britain before reforms in the nineteenth century back when only rich land holders could vote in parliament
We should abolish intellectual property rights	We think that the impact of this is that people will invest much less of their time and effort into creating intellectual property this as many harms first culturally you'll, see a much reduced output of films and books and other types of cultural goods that rely on intellectual property because artists will be able to support themselves anymore
