We should legalize cannabis	And thus the health harms to marijuana will be significantly down played in a way that precludes informed consent
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	China has this power over a lot of members as does russia
We should adopt libertarianism	Most recently in the financial sector, with two thousand the two thousand eight financial crisis
We should ban anonymous posts	Our second point is that banning anonymous posting is completely unenforceable
Physical education should be mandatory	This is a personal choice, and we think that it ought be left to individuals so there's no reason for the government to get involved now we'll talk about a third standard that I want to deal with real quick
We should ban partial birth abortions	We say, first of all, it's not clear at all there's a good reason why it's inside the womb for nine months, it needs those nutrients, it needs the protective atmosphere in order to to grow and develop and it's a very ins, not clear at all that a fetus would survive earlier than eight to nine months birth
