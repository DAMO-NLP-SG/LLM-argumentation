We should further exploit wind power	I am proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should further exploit when power our first independent point is birds
We should ban anonymous posts	And being able to post anonymously, brings a kind of shield your identity, and it makes it more likely that you could be willing to engage and express your thoughts in the first place
We should lower the age of consent	What this means is that every year that teens get older, they are able to make better and better decisions biologically, but on top of that, every decision that you make is informed by past experience, people who have more experience are more likely to be able to make good decisions
