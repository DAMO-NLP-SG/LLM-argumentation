We should ban partial birth abortions	This could be, you know, physical, like actual health risks associated with it
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	You see that the soviet union was one of the founding members and that china under chiang kai shek when they were admitted, was also not a democracy
We should further exploit wind power	The reason for this is that not a whole because renewable energies are at this moment, not very profitable and it's not something that investors are looking to you really invested in the status quo
We should disband ASEAN	It allows them to work together towards a common goal of independence, and it reassures the independence of every member state from international oppression and dependence on one country for trade
We should abolish the US Electoral College	So california has over fifty votes because so many people live there what this means is that ultimately a we balance the interests of small and populous states
We should abolish intellectual property rights	If you know that people are just going to create their own films and not credit, you would all using those characters
We should ban beauty contests	But I think that the fundamental thing that we're going to talk about is why adults ought be able to consent and participate in these kinds of activities as a brief overview
We should ban beauty contests	We believe that individuals can make statements about war can make statements about what is best for society, although we only focus on the worst answers if you actually watch beauty pageants, if you don't have the sort of stigma which my opponent and braces you see these women very regularly, give cogent intelligent responses and make statements about the current system of police brutality, bore the military industrial complex and the wrong doings of society at large as such
We should abolish intellectual property rights	If you buy that this is the case and for the vast majority of countries there's an obvious there are all these laws protecting property rights, we would say that intellectual property is no philosophically different from physical property that has been protected by modern states since their conception, we would say that intellectual property requires the exertion of immense amounts of mental effort, immense amounts of innovation, an immense amount of investment from individuals, and we think that intellectual property clearly has in in in some intense market value
We should disband ASEAN	And the second argument made by danielle is that's easy and excludes other options, such as multi lateral or direct negotiations and he's, and he seems to think that these are better because they are smaller deals in scope, they're faster to agree upon and negotiate like better terms
We should ban anonymous posts	I think one reason why there are so many more people with diverse identities out in the open today than there were thirty years ago is that people can find community online in a way that they can't in person don't feel comfortable talking about things like sexuality or gender identity, if they live in a conservative country or a conservative area of the country
We should lower the age of consent	My second argument that restricted autonomy, although this policy seems to increase total autonomy, we think that will actually decrease it
We should disband ASEAN	So we tell you that people in AC on countries can study in other countries and learn about development industry and how other countries have been successful in the past and use this in order to help their own home country
We should further exploit unconventional oil	Okay, so recognize that alternate methods of oil are the least clean ways of extracting oil going to things like sands and using fracking aren't, both incredibly difficult in the status quo, which means the method of extraction, both requires the use of energy in order to extract a higher rate than other types of energy extraction, but also have the most impact on local ecology
Sex education should be mandatory	So I want to talk about what's in avoids talking about in these are specific populations that this proposition is going to be very, very problematic for we're talking, of course, about religious populations where any type of sexual education that is not abstinence only will be perceived by parents as an attempt of the school or of the state to corrupt their children, and we think that the potential to backlash in this sensitive matter is huge as we've already mentioned earlier, schools, avoid inserting politics into the classroom and there's no way around this six is a political issue
We should ban partial birth abortions	So first, we think that there's a general right to bodily autonomy in that people should have the right to do as they please but their own bodies on
We should ban anonymous posts	We tell you that the kinds of extremist you might want to stop from talking online are still able to do so therefore so there's, no successful affected this policy for all these reasons we should not ban anonymous posting
We should disband ASEAN	One on how blocks bring more power to the region and to on how economic dependence between nations is a good thing, particularly in an otherwise rather tense region of the world, a few points of refutation t I'll before we go to the argument
We should ban cosmetic surgery	Now it can be argued that this has become too extreme because of the model of beauty but that's a reality that is unlikely going to change because people are just programmed by nature to be attracted to or to be like not attracted to people based on their appearance
We should adopt libertarianism	The second argument is that this creates profound collective action problems
We should ban beauty contests	There are many other reasons in our culture that this might be the case I mentioned modeling earlier, and I think it's quite likely that as long as you continue the trend of marketing products by having beautiful women appear in their commercials that people will objectify women
We should ban cosmetic surgery	And yes, you could point to the sort of signaling the facts that cosmetic surgery has the sort of perpetuation that we've already talked about
We should lower the age of consent	So we should really be talking about is a much younger age of consent, and what james is pretending it is don't
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	This is just behavior that bothers people so we don't understand on what grounds the separate here between something that bothers people and harm if we're talking for instance, about a neighbor that insist on playing his music really really loud, and this is harassment plain and simple
We should ban anonymous posts	So every comment that people make to a facebook profile or something similar to online comments you a bridge that freedom of speech we see that this is already acknowledged by courts around the world to the point that doc sing the practice of releasing someone's personal information without their permission is a crime or has been banned in many jurisdictions
Physical education should be mandatory	We see that many overweight people or disabled people are able to be good workers
We should ban cosmetic surgery	We live in a country that values protecting individual freedom, even when they think that the decisions they might make our part for themselves or for society, something perpetuating a bad nor is not reason enough to ban it and tim doesn't do nearly enough work to show you why it should be and why should outweigh those personal freedoms
We should adopt libertarianism	So specifically government brings up this example of like smoking and being a legal and bars in massachusetts, we think this is actually a really good example of a fundamentally important type of regulation regulations that prevent third party harms gulf is correct when they say that people should be able to do is they choose and have what happens to them as they please
We should lower the age of consent	They had with people of the opposite sex within this is an incredibly problematic as learning that all individuals are equal in that all individuals are respectable occurs at least somewhat in terms of individuals having childhood friends of the opposite sex
We should ban partial birth abortions	The crucial thing that these have an impact on is the availability of an abortion
We should ban anonymous posts	These are really tiny things that are really central to the way individuals self actualizing, personally identify, like, working guys that things like LGBT q forums like our women's, sexual health forms
We should ban anonymous posts	Our first point is that anonymous posting allows valuable discourse while it's true as will said that some people take anonymous posting as an excuse to be the tree, all look were hateful at the same time
We should ban cosmetic surgery	We all put different valuations on anything from physical pain in long term health care implications to physical appearance, to monetary cost, given all of these different moving pieces and the different ways in which different people value them
We should ban beauty contests	We don't think that you should ban this one thing and uniquely but what's more implicit in many of the arguments of the other side is that it is anti feminist to have beauty pageants, but we would advance a conception of feminism in which by making their own choices about how to live their lives, even if women choose to participate in patriarchal power structures, they're empowering themselves and that they should be the end goal of feminism
We should ban partial birth abortions	It doesn't mean that women are going to end up being like, like just because the abortion happened
We should legalize cannabis	And to me, it seems unlikely that there will be any time soon no similar technology to gauge recent use of cannabis
We should legalize cannabis	So we think that generally speaking when third party harms occur on a band is justified because even if people are allowed to consent into harm upon themselves, you are not allowed to consent other people into harm's
We should further exploit wind power	You have to rebuild the entire power plant they're, not scalar, which means that you're locked in to an inefficient form of energy that won't scale up well in the future
We should ban beauty contests	This has worked partially and very slowly and I'm like we would have wanted perhaps it's time to change our approach and change the way that we treat men specifically, we advocate in this debate the already existing and rapidly growing phenomenon of things like chippendales backstreet, boys, one direction and justin bieber now, here's something that I never thought that I would say, truly our line is simple
We should adopt libertarianism	But I think that the comparison here is between a society like most developed societies today with the large but not enormous amount of state intervention versus the libertarian society will proposes and ultimately our world is better for everyone so therefore we should not adopt libertarianism
We should ban fraternities	What that actually means is that students living in the town around the school have set up unofficial fraternities instead so they're, not regulated by the school
We should lower the age of consent	Fourteen certainly is not ready inherent and frankly frequent to risk of sex being pregnancy means that we should not put children in a situation which is possible to have a child due to the actions that they take by banning it, we will decrease the total incidents of pregnancy to a great extent and allow individuals live a better quality of life into the long term
We should adopt libertarianism	I stand and firm opposition to the motion that we should adopt libertarianism
Sex education should be mandatory	They must assume that whatever he says is true without doubting him too much alley features will start discussing issues that are not clear cut and will make a stand in this case like making a stand for instance that having sex in the young is like having sex in a young age or before marriage is acceptable, then they are doing something unfair, the are you abusing their power and their authority
We should adopt libertarianism	One overview before three reasons why we should not adopt libertarianism may overviews very simply that in any western over the market, see where this kind of debate would ever be possible, the alternatives, our liberty and democracy without adopting libertarianism, we can easily adopt a system work every individual gets a say in the government where there's not profound amounts of gerrymandering or abuse, and where there is ample amounts of government intervention and regulation in this speech, I'm going to show it
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	The veto was basically what makes the united nations useful if there's no security council veto, then there's no reason for powerful countries like russia or the united states which can impose their will globally without need for recourse to the united nations to participate in the united nations we see that in the past, the united nations has been extremely successful at preventing war between powerful countries
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	I'm proud to oppose the motion that we should abolish the anti social behavioral disorders
We should ban cosmetic surgery	In order to serve this ideal say that I was born with a disfigurement of some sort that makes me ashamed or in secure
We should ban anonymous posts	So we think that because a person is defined by their preferences and their opinions that like this fundamentally is what makes me distinct from other people, your past self can be considered fundamentally distinct from your present self, your preferences in the basic thoughts and ideas that make up who you are change over time
We should legalize cannabis	So possibly doing things that are like cruder crossed that make people fit like very uncomfortable being outside in public
We should further exploit wind power	If you put it near the tall buildings, if you put it near even tall trees, it can block the wind turbines and make them considerably less efficient
We should ban partial birth abortions	Specifically, we think that by banning this type of abortion that you give an inch to anti abortion activists and as such hot, this has political ramifications on abortions that are performed at earlier stages, we think there's this bizarre prevailing logic that like if you ban partial birth abortions that signals that like will we're not getting behind the really egregious things in the viscerally obvious things we're just saying that like these, we cases of what abortion should be allowed all make sense
We should lower the age of consent	And we don't want people to go through that or alternatively either race by young parents were not as wealthy and were less experienced it aren't able to provide for them in the same way that older parents could
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	And I think we already have mechanisms that we apply to other aspects
We should legalize cannabis	Our third and final argument is that most countries around the world, perhaps all are signatories of international agreements which prohibit the creation and distribution of certain illegal drugs, and that marijuana is one of them
We should ban partial birth abortions	But I think this fundamentally violates the point of the motion because these are basically t only situations where people even request these partial birth abortions
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	This is just something that is fun for you, but it can be actively harmful to others
We should abolish intellectual property rights	The reason for this is that even though there are like patent trolls and people that just snatch up good ideas and then try to sue people for building on that idea, we think that innovation goes down because there's a necessity to work because there's no incentive to innovate when you can't get the returns on your investment
We should ban beauty contests	And for the money on ours, three main areas of clash
We should lower the drinking age	We call this the anchoring effect this the number that we set is being used as a sort of a metaphorical anchor that people don't stray too far from so we say that it's it's perfectly make reasonable, but the other side or saying that the current drinking age is a bit unfair to eighteen year olds, but as they tell us themselves, h like eighteen year, olds don't really suffer too much out of this, the drink anyways
We should ban beauty contests	Additionally, we think that people can just be individually in power
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So we think that the rich who can afford to travel will still have access but middle class or working class people who might have been able to save up for this type of procedure if it were available to them in britain or america or wherever they live are now going to have no access
We should abolish the US Electoral College	We should not abolish the US electoral college, so well, people may be with an uproar given that the two of the last five presidential elections resulted in a result in which the popular vote winner did not win the electoral college and therefore did not become president of the united states
We should disband ASEAN	So we shouldn't disband AC on our last argument is about peace in the region recognize that there are many potential sources of conflict within the southeast asia region
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	Ultimately, these are still signed by a judge or jury, so we don't think they're completely unreasonable, and moreover, the gradation of the punishment fits the crime
We should lower the drinking age	We also think it's bad because currently it's already difficult for high school kids to get alcohol because no one in high school is twenty one on you have to in order to obtain it, you either have to steal it from parents or make someone who's older your friend
We should ban cosmetic surgery	And this is equally someone thought I think also the problem is that even if it's harmful to you may have to show that it's so harmful to yourself or others that it is worth the band at the point that we refused to ban cigarettes, which can literally cause cancer, both yourself and innocent bystanders who happened in hell your smoke
We should lower the age of consent	And this means we are going to have to continue on lowering the age of consent, more and more
We should further exploit wind power	So there are a limited amount of investors, and there are women amount of central government funds that can go into renewable energy resources, other funder, going into also fuels and those types of energies
We should ban beauty contests	We think that scholarships money in recruitment for jobs like colleges often happen at beauty, pageants people have a right to go for that like I'd like to go to my overview
We should ban cosmetic surgery	First on it, why it's not justified to them recognize that cosmetic surgery, doesn't hurt the people who is were doing it, and it doesn't have any overflow arms right
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	And when you take away power from those who see it as necessary to that, we think that all that happens is that none of these five national security nations are going to be willing to give up their effective veto and so are going to exercise it to the manipulation of countries
We should subsidize biofuels	It causes much more CO, two causes much more greenhouse gas emissions that cause much more environmental degradation than your average production of oil, even in cases of fracking
We should ban partial birth abortions	One that is logically consistent one that says, look fetuses just don't have rights
Sex education should be mandatory	Now I don't know where ten gets his data from on like places without sex education, having more problems, but they don't sound reliable and even if they are the only establishes correlation it's best to not because ation to the constructive
We should lower the age of consent	And you end up in the kind of power discounts relationships that we're talking about it's just true that there's something wrong with the twenty eight year old who's dating sixteen year old that sixteen year old probably needs to be protected from them
Physical education should be mandatory	So that's not important like you should leave it like, like recesses, like a good enough time to get this right arm and secondarily like the second reason why p their portion be mandatory is like all this comes in conjunction with an assumption that p e, which is bad as I just talked about this is a suitable replacement for actually working out which is bad
We should lower the age of consent	So obviously we think it would be a little bit ridiculous to just are you like to change it into lower it's for one year
We should ban cosmetic surgery	And this is important because then you're not necessarily going to have is informed decisions because you're not gonna have the same laws regarding what doctors have to see to their patients you're, not going to have the same safety checks to make sure things like equipment is clean doctors are qualified, are you won't have those concerts are you one of those things
We should ban anonymous posts	And we think that that's a right that exist regardless of the intent behind whatever those individuals are doing like
We should abolish intellectual property rights	For example, if you created a song, if you're a songwriter, you made the song, we think that you should have the ability to determine where that song is played and who gets to use it, for example, many people don't allow politicians to use their music because they are so scene with that music and their brand is associated with that music and they don't want to be politicized or they disagree politician and we can doesn't hardly fair and without intellectual property rights instances like that would not allow the creator to be protected
Bullfighting should be banned	For example, I know that I have the right to reasonable trial trial by jury of my peers and a right to be protected in courts
We should ban cosmetic surgery	The vast majority of people are just born into the state that they live in, or they were forced to live in the state by the circumstances out of their control
We should ban partial birth abortions	Likewise, with bodily autonomy, your bodily autonomy does not go out the window
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	It is good if their names and shame because they can continue to get through the day, even though this punishment has occurred
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	Second argument is that this will change these groups of people's papers overall
We should ban cosmetic surgery	The problem with this is that as we told you these beauty standards are already there at most a there is a marginal reinforcement when the top one percent meets the most cosmetic surgery, we think the vast majority of people are still not doing it in order to look the way the men want for that like if only because they simply do not have the money to do so on a personal level will did not address any problems
We should abolish intellectual property rights	So recent studies stating that like specific amino acids can decrease by set mutations, but these never get put into play because if it is a very generalized non patentable martin molecule, no one wants to frisk me creating that technology because they don't know if it's gonna work out, we also think that patents in the promise of intellectual property motivates used to enter these kinds of tech field in the first place because there's the promise of discovering something new and putting it and making it your own
We should legalize cannabis	And ultimately quite anti social or that the police will resort to profiling and making decisions that are based on prejudice about whether or not they think someone has been using marijuana
We should disband ASEAN	Some countries are more closely aligned with china, so they see an advantage in china becoming more hegemonic
We should ban cosmetic surgery	And what not that are on, you know, brought up routinely throughout these types of debates on something like a car crash victim getting facial reconstruction
We should ban anonymous posts	So for all those reasons, very proud to oppose this motion
We should ban beauty contests	Ladies and gentlemen, we have an interesting opposition line for you today, let's see how this goes
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So we think that you might as well be allowed to do what you want proud to oppose
We should lower the age of consent	This takes time this means that as our children are not really physically ready to have sex, this this social norm is increasingly becoming more and more open to the to the idea that they are with every passing generation
We should lower the drinking age	These third party harms are fundamentally unacceptable and are not a meaningful benefit when compared to the arguments I thought opponent gets quite simply age based restrictions exist on a variety of fronts certain rights are given to the parents
We should abolish intellectual property rights	We think that intellectual property rights ensure that creators get to profit off of their efforts to get to profit off of their intellectual property
We should ban cosmetic surgery	We think this is because individuals have the ability to make decisions based on their personal preferences and priorities that the state simply doesn't know or understand
Sex education should be mandatory	This is math english literature pushing the a certain subject at the detriment of all of the others does little more than create a political system for schools, which does not serve the general genuine purpose of schools, which is educating their students
We should ban cosmetic surgery	We believe that banning cosmetic surgeries harm both the principle of autonomy over one's body and people's identities that first of all, we think that we should distinguish cases of true deformities or for instance, procedures that are meant to restore one's previous looks after he suffered an injury that resulted in some deformities side government doesn't, say anything to that effect all the talk about this botox and like breast enhancement surgeries, obviously, we think that that is a huge impact on the debate and a huge harm that they do not addressed at all moving on
We should legalize cannabis	But we think that what's important here is that there is a precedent not to sell recreational drugs when the public believes that they are unethical or ought not be used and to sell them on the public supports them
Bullfighting should be banned	Secondly, and most importantly, animals cannot reciprocate, those rights, the only way that rights have power within society is one all of us choose to reciprocate those obligations on those rights on to those around us
We should ban beauty contests	So we don't think we should single out people who participate in beauty pageants
We should ban beauty contests	So we're gonna, focus on two things were going to start by talking about objectification and why opponents of beauty contests, their anger is misplaced in talking about the objectification that exists within beauty contests
We should lower the drinking age	This is very important because alcohol is proven to mess up your brain, a lot of ways to stunt its ability to grow to kill to kill aspects of it and that's a really big problem, because when they're there for when you allow people to take alcohol, a young age you're, essentially allowing them to poison their development, which is obviously not something that we should walk this second thing though, is that due to will do to the increase lack of maturity, that's more likely to be present in younger people there's more of a likelihood that you're going to experience the worst aspects of alcohol
We should ban partial birth abortions	So I don't really think that the time of the abortion itself is a particularly good standard, especially given that there is active actives lake like there there's people who are actively trying to make it difficult to get an abortion specifically, so you can't get it until it's already too late to get your abortion and that's seen as a tool, essentially by like republicans and conservatives, the combat portion
We should lower the drinking age	You allow free reign to help free reign of alcohol to young people, especially people that don't have the life experience and the mental development to understand how to drink responsibly you're more likely to have these people become alcoholics in their life
We should ban beauty contests	We allow individuals to smoke cigarettes to get breast implants because we value individual freedom more than we value societal outcomes in so far as we want to avoid recognizing the individual because that tends to be abusive in so far as the goddess, idiosyncratic, and this has clearly been deemed to be good by society let it stand proud to oppose
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	So our first argument is that these anti social behavior orders are necessary to fight harassment, recognize that before the mid twentieth century, when these policies started to be implemented, there just was no legal way to fight against harassment
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	For instance, the US doesn't have to go into the awkward position of defending israel from a foreign invasion because of the UN security council
We should lower the drinking age	So at that point, and because the american government is dependent on public will for its legitimacy, we think it would actually be in just to raise or lower the drinking age again, if the government says that something is moral or immoral without public support the need eventually is tantamount to the state deciding what is and is not ethical or moral
We should further exploit wind power	So firstly, when power is renewable and clean well it is renewable, and perhaps relatively clean, of course, it's not perfect for the environment and wind farms do adversely affect the wildlife and natural habitats and scenery off wherever they are located
We should adopt libertarianism	So when I have lots of disposable money, it's not worth as much to me because the diminishing marginal returns on the individual dollars that I have are less and less the more I have, you think equalizing the playing field means the most utility, because people get the most bang for their buck
We should disband ASEAN	Some countries are capitalist it's been conflict in the past over east timor, and there are other ethnic tensions, boiling beneath the surface in many southeast asian countries
We should abolish the US Electoral College	So if someone were to try to engage in for example, like hacking election, his jeans or something like that it's really difficult to do because there's no lack of stuff because there's no standardization across state lines, if you engage in a national vote, however, that's sanitization becomes necessary
We should legalize cannabis	So even if you don't buy like all three of these standards on any one of them is sufficient to trigger a band being justified, our first independent point is that there is an information asymmetry intrinsic to marijuana consumption
We should ban anonymous posts	So they can't have the information on those forms used against them, not because that information is dangerous
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So this is going to mean that people are still going to get cosmetic surgery, but it's going to be let's
We should further exploit unconventional oil	They tell us that the men is it in elastic people need to keep people need transportation, they don't get less when it's more expensive, we say, they're misleading
Physical education should be mandatory	You essentially use that time as best as you can there's only so much
We should legalize cannabis	So basically countries around the world like the US and EU countries have agreed that they won't legalize marijuana that they will criminalize its use that'll prevent its production and distribution if the united states or britain or some other company country decides that they're going to opt out of this ultimately they're acting in bad faith with regard to these international agreements
We should abolish intellectual property rights	If you want people to be creative, then you need to offer them some sort of reward to incentivize them to develop those skills so were fewer people have unique skills in a world where you don't allow intellectual property rights
We should ban beauty contests	Well, beauty is only one metric of judging the human being it's, not invalid for someone to be empowered by their beauty and to want to express that through these type of contests
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So what they do on their side is further entrench the norm that the very wealthy are much more attractive than the rest of us now because they're the only ones with access to the surgery server these reasons we think that you should not ban cosmetic surgery
We should abolish intellectual property rights	This makes it harder for your workers to interact with the rest of the globe, disincentive eyes as foreign direct investment, and ultimately makes it harder for your country to catch up with the more developed countries
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	And so I could know exactly how you must behave in order, not to break the law let's move on over to the positive
Physical education should be mandatory	You would say that the physical education should not be mandatory
We should abolish intellectual property rights	So first on fairness, broadly we would say that property rights are important and all be protected, we would say that people exert effort time and put their own labor into the products of their creation, and because they are the sole creators of the primary creators of their products
We should further exploit unconventional oil	Two things were going to discuss today, one on international relations and direct engagement with proposition
We should further exploit unconventional oil	Why isn't a zero sum game, a money is fungible any money that I've invested into these forms of energy can be reinvested into green energy, given that it's important technology
We should lower the drinking age	So first and foremost let's talk about why drinking is bad for the health of young people
We should ban beauty contests	This is why there was demand to establish beauty pageants in the first place
Bullfighting should be banned	Look at the end of the day bullfighting kills a bowl instruct the more entertaining way than the slaughter house
We should ban beauty contests	And even a minor way, we think that beauty pageants art expression expression of speech, and the idea that government should go in and banned them is taking away the rights of individuals simply because some people feel unsafe, although many liberals like to express the idea that hate speech are problematic speech should be banned giving this sort of power to government government can easily lead to a turning of the tides
Sex education should be mandatory	The question then becomes is this bad sex education, worse than no sex education
Physical education should be mandatory	So why should we tell sixteen year olds that they have to do so now it's true that we treat children differently from adults in some respects, but if you think that the absolute good is sufficient reason for the government to abrogate personal freedom, then you should apply it to everyone and make everybody go out and play a game of soccer every saturday and run three miles every day since it's clear that we wouldn't do that I don't see why they should apply to children as well
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	But when there's a drug prohibition against the action when you're worried about getting caught doing it, regardless of who's around you are secondary of clash is about how it's most democratic because as usual says a lot of the time these kinds of rules, and these kind of acts are determined by the surrounding society
We should disband ASEAN	So because it's an anti colonial institution because it promotes development and because it will be to peace in the region, we should not disband ishi on
Physical education should be mandatory	So we understand the need for something like recess, but we don't think that something is long and time consuming as physical education is necessary at the point where it can be handled elsewhere
We should disband ASEAN	Firstly, in cooperation incorporating these conversions, these nations increase their global clout as individual nations, their rather small on the global scale, but when you interact as a block in global talks, a global treaty, arguments and things like this, we think you increase the amount of bargaining power that these countries get overall, which means that you're more likely to get benefits coming to you and things like trees on global warming and things like global security treaties that are beneficial to these regional actors on an economic economic level
We should ban cosmetic surgery	They talk about how this medic surgery enhances the model of beauty and all of its harms to society
We should lower the drinking age	So we believe that especially at a young age like in your teenage years children again, don't have access to the necessary information to make informed decisions on everything that they do given that we afford a lot of latitude to parents in being essentially the proxies for their best interest because parents do have access to that information they've lived longer lives and understand more about the world
We should lower the age of consent	And there are a huge part of the voting populace that we ought to for to the public will and the public will stand the age of consent be somewhere between sixteen to eighteen in most free countries
Sex education should be mandatory	Secondly, we say that in order for the teachers status not to be harmed, we want to avoid unnecessary conflicts between teachers and parents if I hear that my child is hearing from his teacher, all sorts of things that I oppose
We should abolish the US Electoral College	What the point where our lawmakers are elected by gerrymandered districts and have a vested interest in preventing the american people from having a lot of control over elections, there's no reason to assume that they wouldn't come up with some ridiculous and unfair method of selecting the president, perhaps they would have the president be elected by the house of representatives and the senate rather like help prime ministers are selected in countries like france, but this would just transfer power farther away from the people and make gerrymandering effective at the presidency as well as in other respects, or perhaps they would come up with some system whereby it was based entirely on popular will
We should lower the drinking age	The drinking age, the first is that a higher drinking age limits access for teens
We should abolish intellectual property rights	We think it's clear that we should not abolish intellectual property rights
Physical education should be mandatory	And we think that if you're spending that time on doing something that can be done just as easily at home arm, you know, you can the comparative is teaching them
We should lower the drinking age	So with drinking, particularly that we think that children are uninformed and the consequences of this action and as such it is reasonable to proxy off the decision about whether or not they can engage in drinking to a parent
We should ban anonymous posts	And this is like it makes the problem even harder to really focus on
We should lower the age of consent	And the reason for this is because first and foremost, obviously a whole lot of places throughout the united states and other parts of the world too don't teach us sex education until either later in life, or if they do teach at all it's oftentimes taught in not very ideal ways, it's not like abstinence only sex education, but secondarily there is an additional problem with having sex before the age of consent because there's also problems with being able to purchase health care, for example, your oftentimes not able to get access to birth control
We should ban fraternities	We have three arguments for our side for why fraternity should be allowed to continue and exist at universities
We should ban cosmetic surgery	It is still a woman's right to model herself in the male gaze, even if it is something that is bad for society writ large, we think this is about the individual woman's choice and what empowers her not about societal reaction, two main areas of clash, the first on the standards of a ban it is generally accepted that a democratic government can ban something if there is either a large personal harm that requires paternalism, or if large third party harms that allows you to personalize an individual's choices will says but society in the reinforcement of stereo types
We should ban anonymous posts	But we also think that for people who live in politically repressive countries such as many arab countries that this is uniquely valuable
We should lower the age of consent	Second thing to say here is that we think that the changes in social norms just continue on happening in the pattern of like an ongoing race to younger and younger ages
We should legalize cannabis	The recreational market means more usage happens because you legality is actually a barrier to purchasing like when someone makes that calculus in deciding am I going to smoke this we're, not only going to go out and buy this or not generally speaking, it is more likely that person will decide know if there is a risk of like four rastra fight or something if they do so secondly, consent is not always meaningful into doing this
Physical education should be mandatory	So we think that it's particularly problematic to put children in a position where they are more subject to sort of like bullying and social pressures
We should adopt libertarianism	So when you drastically roll back the government and people start dying of easily preventable illnesses, and there are no public schools and people are starving, all of us will be responsible for that it is an act of aggression, not to have a large and generous social safety net
We should ban anonymous posts	Look, it is really important to recognize the circumstances that odd that sam talks about having anonymous posts are not the majority of circumstances in which they are used sure we agree sometimes awful people do awful things by manipulating the fact that they are anonymous and allowing themselves to post really awful things from behind the mask of anonymity, the internet offers, but just because that not minority of individuals exists doesn't mean you should remove the anonymity of many, many, many other people who are doing things that are infinitely better
We should lower the age of consent	So the number that appears in these laws is some sort of anchor that dictates the general area of ages in which people are going to like in which children are going to have sex with adults
We should lower the age of consent	Look, I think the problem is with the way that danny tries to characterize when these kinds of laws are actually put in place because there is a never there's never a world in which to underage kids are engaged in sexual relations, and one of them get sued, because at that point, both have equal legal standing to sue the author, and there just isn't an incentive to do so, especially since this is often times an expensive and painful process
We should further exploit wind power	This is a good reason, not to further exploit when power is that every wealthy country like britain or like the states has the option to buy into more efficient forms of energy like liquid thorium reactors that are being used today, china
We should adopt libertarianism	We think things like roads, we think a central emergency services must be solved through collective action
We should legalize cannabis	We see this in states like oregon, washington and the lasko, the these states have already had investigations by the department of justice, but continued to be racist as it is essentially a symptom of the police system, legalizing pot, legalizing cannabis will not solve this two arguments for why legalizing cannabis is a bad idea
We should ban cosmetic surgery	The reason for this is because people don't have the choice to opt into the state people have the choice of the society that breeds them with that sars that they have
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So firstly, on freedom, we don't think that the government has the right or the power to ban something into a prohibited action when it doesn't have a direct adverse effect on someone else
We should ban beauty contests	We think it's unfair that you restrict that choice and trying to find solutions to issues and solutions to a patriarchal system
Physical education should be mandatory	But we also think that there is indeed for the state to insure than that
We should abolish intellectual property rights	So if you think that people get value off of art or if people get value from listening to music, if it makes our lives better it's important, make sure the you're supporting the people who give you that sense of happiness when you listen to a great song and debate we which this is supported, is by making sure they're able to make a living by doing what they're doing, but without an intellectual property right it's, impossible for them to actually make this living because anyone can just rip them off use their song
We should lower the drinking age	First on why not having a quick all having a drinking age doesn't actually fix the problems rather just pushes them to a lower age because you don't remove the top you're still going to have parents that say you can't drink until axe age because letting your six year old drink is justin on reasonable and untenable system that can lead to long term brain damage and addiction to alcohol so it on their side of the house, you're still going to have twelve thirteen fourteen year old we're going to try it and be afraid to tell their parents or the police because they don't want to get charged for it
We should further exploit unconventional oil	We want to a lesser reliance on these and that's the best way to actually reduce our carbon footprint, and this creates a bit of a problem because when you keep exploiting what you already have you're essentially just conceding to being lazy and sheep and kind of stupid to be honest because you're not reinvesting in greentech, an infrastructure as you should be you're, just relying on the things that you already have access to as well
We should lower the drinking age	We usually say that eighteen year old probably shouldn't drink because they're prefrontal cortex is growing expanding and essentially becoming more effective alcohol can inhibit this, but if children as young as ten are drinking alcohol, the entirety of their brain is growing their forening, the synapses that will be effective in living for their entire lives, they consume alcohol at this young age, we would say that they were likely to face profound consequences for their overall development, the likely to face more issues later in life, anger, issues emotional issues as they are not able to effectively grow
We should abolish the US Electoral College	So the popular vote doesn't always have a majority, but the electoral college does the deeper impact of this is that it reduces for force recalls and dragged out elections
We should ban anonymous posts	People are always going to find a way to post anonymously
We should lower the drinking age	The problem is is so obviously, like a lot of the time, particularly in the united states there's a culture of parents if they are okay with it, just allowing their kids to have drinks before, it's legal in usually this isn't cracked down on
We should lower the age of consent	So we're gonna talk about the broad benefits of having a higher age of consent
We should adopt libertarianism	We think that there is a fundamental injustice in society on particularly modern society where there is massive income and wealth inequity on this is largely a product of the fact that poverty often happens in cycles
We should adopt libertarianism	We would say that all that does is create a vacuum or the presently rich and powerful can decide literally every rule they want for themselves incredibly little government oversight
Physical education should be mandatory	And finally, we think that physical education and physical education classes are honestly traumatic for many individuals students are regularly bullied in these classes
We should lower the drinking age	Then, because we think that drinking is something that is a particularly important decision, not just in terms of the way that it can affect your life
We should legalize cannabis	Both of these are terrible options that are far more likely if the cartel has no other option, the cartel has huge infrastructure, put in place to smuggle goods into the united states and will continue these paths
Physical education should be mandatory	No, I don't see how physical education directly contributes to this it's true that people will be healthier in the long run if they do more physical education, but it doesn't directly make them a better citizen
We should further exploit wind power	But in addition to that, I also think that they can be more effective in there you like solar energy can be more much more effective in its use of export it compared to wind farms, wind power in now there is a few reasons for this of first and foremost because of the potential for energy
We should lower the drinking age	I'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should lower the drinking age, three, independent points
Physical education should be mandatory	Our second and final point is about the purpose of education because let's remember we don't take all these kids away from their families and send them off to school for ten hours a day for fun
We should adopt libertarianism	All the way up to bill gates had some say over how the country is run and what services are available rates
We should ban beauty contests	I also just think that oftentimes it can be used to celebrate different kinds of attractiveness, certainly maybe not body type
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	So we think that criminal law should be concerned op, principally with mitigating damage upon innocent people and preventing them from experiencing harm, even if the harm is somewhat minimal at that point, then we think the anti social behavioral disorders are uniquely equipped to deal with that three independent points pertaining to the mechanisms by which the anti social behavioral disorders mitigate the proliferation of anti social behavior
We should ban cosmetic surgery	The first is about freedom, and the second one is about power
We should ban partial birth abortions	And at this point, then when you're looking at the most extreme instances of when it is justified for a woman to have an abortion because there is the most egregious in obvious harm being inflicted upon the woman's body is of incredible importance to ensuring that that right is preserved
We should further exploit wind power	But if we invest in research and development people drive costs down, except no, it wouldn't go unless them has plans to develop some new way to create more wind at greater speeds, artificially around the globe, which will which by the way will be also disastrous for the entire global climate
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	This brings me to my two arguments first on the facts on large nations, we believe that what this does is guarantee the large nations will be happy enough to stay and continue supporting the united nations
We should ban beauty contests	And I think the idea that we have to control the way in which women present their bodies to the world because we're worried about the way that men are going to react to that when this happens is the oldest of it all is an old would sign of the kerr of like the on the presence of p turkey in society, I think that's quite bad, but additionally, I also think that the be a beauty contest or in a lot of weight actively anti patriarchal in the way that they exist
We should further exploit wind power	Yeah, we would say that solar power is immensely further advance, especially given that there are companies like solar city run by you on must that already have immense amounts of resources at their disposal and are already putting products on the market
We should lower the age of consent	So even beyond just the pragmatic impacts of what this policy entails we think there's a problematic signal sent from the state that then creates a societal discursive shift that is problematic for the individuals that are now going to be are losing their legal protections prod to oppose
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So the idea that it is cosmetic surgery that creates an expectation is incredibly misguided, like maybe it affirms that expectation, but we don't think that's meaningful harmful either because recognize that the amount of people were willing to pay for cosmetic surgery, tends to be individuals who have extreme issues with their current body that isn't going to go away right there, people who are willing to spend that money even though it is so much
Bullfighting should be banned	And the second is that people should be allowed to take risks in that risk aversion and trying to maximize the length of one's life is not the only metric of a good life lived
We should ban cosmetic surgery	It is a lot more physically damaging to me oftentimes cost just as much and I'm still meeting the same beauty stereo types, women who have too much money for their own good and hate their bodies are going to find a way to satisfy those standards regardless what this round is about is whether or not they ought be able to choose the method by which they do so and whether paternalism is justified, we tell you that we prefer a safer way more than that
We should ban partial birth abortions	And finally getting an abortion is just a hard choice for women so it's something that they can't just it's, not just something that a lot of people like come to the conclusion very easily, some people struggle with that decision
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	Secondly, we think that the anti social behavioral disorders are more adaptable than typical criminal law
We should lower the drinking age	Second point is about public will recognize that the higher drinking age wasn't, an instance of top down governance, forcing the american people to accept something they didn't want public interest groups campaign for this, and ultimately it was put into place in order to appease those public interest groups
We should disband ASEAN	Also, these countries haven't had a war between them in years also probably a good thing like we're, not sure what the mark of success yeah, others trying to reach is, but it seems that these countries are at least partially doing well that may be a marker of success to yes, says look there's, no unifying factor, exactly the point
We should further exploit unconventional oil	One of the ideas that was proposed was that society would naturally moved towards renewable resources as spoil prices grew
We should disband ASEAN	So first wise development, the most important good, if you think about the quality of life in AC on countries, obviously it varies people in malaysia, for instance, have like a middle income quality of life people in vietnam are much poorer, but we think it overall everyone in all of these countries could still benefit from more development
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So parents will actually take their kids to these kinds of shady areas, even if they don't go themselves, but also now you actually get the kind of risks that sam keeps talking about regarding how likely you are to get hurt afterwards or like experience about side effects, our third arguments about why it's not unique government has to show how this is different from doing things like wearing make up for having chicken cutlets in your prompt were using waist trainers all they're doing is forcing people to repetitive processes
We should lower the age of consent	And I think that this creates a problem and not the relationship itself cannot hot cannot be based on like healthy consent given that there is such a prominent age gap, and I think that the age gap between age sixteen and eighteen is a particularly pourtant one because once you turn eighteen, you are essentially now a legal adult you're likely leaving your home you're going to college, you could you're either going to college you're, getting a full time job
Physical education should be mandatory	And we think that parents ultimately know these better than the state at the point where we let parents make decisions like whether or not their children are going to work during high school or how to name them or what religion to have them practice
We should ban beauty contests	We should not ban beauty pageants and just to be clear what we're defending on our side, we would be fine with having a minimum age to enter beauty pageants, but we think that it would be wrong to categorically banned them completely and society
We should abolish the US Electoral College	So we can't just ignore some of them like wyoming, even if they have very small populations now rituals correct that wyoming has a smaller population than most large american cities, but that doesn't change the fact that it has equal sovereignty with california, which has sixty times more people so that's a facet of our legal system, but because the current system has produced so much stability and prosperity and is still generally democratic
We should subsidize biofuels	Then if we wait and let the market decide what we should adopt our second argument is that government money is fungible what we mean by this is that giving money to corporations is not preferable to giving money to the american people recognize that this is basically corporate welfare, you say, if you do the kind of production that we want we will subsidize you will give you some money back but that's money that isn't going to other programs like snap or wake which are important american social welfare programs
We should ban cosmetic surgery	We should not ban cosmetic surgery, I'm going to present three arguments for why this is the case first personal freedom, we think that it is fundamentally arbitrary to ban cosmetic surgery when we allow people to make lots of other ultimately harmful decisions in order to pursue a more attractive figure or face, we think that prince since we allow people to take on a diet supplements and things like that that are heavily regulated we allow people to diet and exercise in unhealthy ways
We should abolish intellectual property rights	Well money, for example, is necessary to gain things like healthcare and stuff like that
We should ban beauty contests	What I mean by this is that I think you have to prove to you that this is the cause of those of those actions of objectifying women, etcetera, rather than just a symptom of a society that already does so being exaggerated in so far as women are going to be sexualized and objectified in literally every other aspect of their lives
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	So ultimately we might as well just have the veto to prevent grandstanding an escalation of tensions, which seems likely to arise if we remove the detail
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So in so far as the cultural harms that sam talks about exist on both sides of the house, the question is just how comfortably can women access the solution, we think that is what matters most in this round, proud to oppose
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	So we see that while proxy wars did take place for instance, in vietnam for the americans are afghanistan for the soviets
Bullfighting should be banned	And while we may provide these rights to animals on certain occasions, because we can see their pain for instance, in this may provide us with this utility, the rights of animals do not exist in the ethereal sounds and do not exist within our social constructs unless we've created them in that way given that in these rate in these regions, the cultures existed in the morality has come to exist in a way that is excluded
We should abolish the US Electoral College	I think that the electoral college has obvious benefits that even on a pragmatic basis make it worth protecting most notably minority rights book, even on like a larger systemic level
We should abolish the US Electoral College	We think that person should be forced to recognize that the issues of rural and urban of coastal states enough internal states of all these groups and we think that the US electoral college best does her best ensures that that's the case
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	But what's important is that right now the u n doesn't, take actions that back major countries into a corner
We should disband ASEAN	On the contrary you other groups, such as the ECB and european union, and which for the most part hegemon screens in the u you've countries like germany and france that are able to push around and dictate what is going on in smaller countries within the same block, where's the asia is an actual democratic body is a body that fosters global corporation and regional cooperation in a way that doesn't subjugate certain nations at the expense of more powerful nations
We should abolish the US Electoral College	So like say that you had a forty sixty split in your state and so in you hide it, ten members of the electoral college is interesting example, you'd have six of them vote for one person and four of them vote for the other on meeting that would be really useful way of making it a more democratic system and we'll be fine with defending that without too many areas of clash as to why you should not abolish the electoral college first ensures that all parts of the country are involved and matter if the popular vote was all that mattered people would only campaign to very populous states
We should lower the age of consent	We believe that the point of these laws and the people that are supposed to target are people who are more predatory in nature, people who have sex with people who are who are years upon years younger than that
We should lower the age of consent	These are things that a large amount of people are simply under informed about look at places that are even developed countries such as the united states, their huge walls of the united states that don't understand safe sex that don't have adequate sexual education that don't understand how to adequately defend yourself against stds giving people an additional an additional amount of years to learn about this information to do their own investigation into their sexual
We should abolish intellectual property rights	The first is about incentivizing creation, and the second is about how this works internationally
We should ban fraternities	Wow, willis correct that there's a lot of illegal or undesirable activity that goes on fraternities at the very least
We should ban fraternities	And those people are able to choose them recognize that college is incredibly difficult, especially when you are first transitioning, your freshman year frats provide a meaningful community that help people through hard times in right
Bullfighting should be banned	The very beginning of this debate is that it has been a cultural institution within the communities that practices such as spain, portugal and parts of southern france for hundreds of years, fighting's tied in with the cultural identity of these regions, deep way it has been part of festivals and celebrations of triumphs and of the history of these people in the culture of these people for hundreds of years
We should ban partial birth abortions	We think there's a far simpler rule, which we can apply which will return better results, which is that we ought not use human beings as a means to an end realize that when you prevent women from having an abortion, you are using them as a tool to bring this child to birth
We should ban beauty contests	But we also just think if the government doesn't have a right to ban it like there are plenty of problematic activities that happen in so far as you can still make children go to hip hop classes that sexualized them and promote the same kind of objectification it's unclear
We should further exploit wind power	So for all these reasons we should not further exploit when power thank you
We should adopt libertarianism	Look, I I understand the sort of philosophical justifications that are given by government
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	We would say that someone being too loud on the phone on the bus, probably isn't a criminal offense, someone harassing people and saying that they want to essentially it deport all muslims probably ought to be a criminal offense as it makes the entire neighborhood in hospital for a particular type of people there's a right to be mean but there's, not a right to be unnecessarily cruel
Sex education should be mandatory	They say that now places where there are no such as sex education classes, children will have unsafe sex and we'll get knocked up and catch stds all over the place and come on
We should ban partial birth abortions	The first is that the first trimester is not enough time for people to make the decision whether or not to have an abortion, the other side tells you that there are okay with allowing people to exercise their choice during the first few months of pregnancy, but we think that there are many reasons why someone might need or want an abortion very reasonably after that time period
We should disband ASEAN	This still saves a lot of transaction costs because we are talking about one big like one big agreements instead of every country having to go through an engaging ten individual agreements, moving on to our constructive arguments
We should ban fraternities	There is some level of influence there you can actually for some rules like party logging and making sure you know where all the parties are things like that
We should lower the drinking age	But the problem with this is that if an individual isn't old enough to understand the consequences, the action, it isn't reasonable to call that consenting into the action or autonomy by any means our second independent point is that people will always drink before the drinking age gulf makes a lot of noise over the fact that people tend to abuse the drinking age arm and drink before it's legal
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	We think it's better, not to defer to democracy, but to have the you and take actions to prevent these wars from breaking out, and that is made possible by the security council veto
We should abolish intellectual property rights	So combination is something that is deserving of a of an ownership claim but also recognize that the most blatant examples of this like, say sampling for example, in music do require you to actually pay money to the person that initially created the things like a lot of the time, the way we combine things requires payments to those who came before us
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	If we would have left things like decisions and matters concerning declarations of war to be settled in the general assembly of the when and to be settled by a simple majority in the general assembly, this would have been way too easy to gather the needed votes to decide to intervene militarily
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	So as we can see things would not have become more fair, only more dangerous and more full of tile, we have no problem with changing the structure of the security council, so would prefer better reflect the current super powers in the world, but the veto rights must remain as a balancing factor when the u n's ability to abuse its powers, please oppose
We should lower the age of consent	We think the problem is that he's going to be making a lot more difficult for those who aren't having consensual sex to report it since on his side of the house will have to go through the whole criminal investigation into whether it was actually raped while on ours, the asian itself is enough to protect the kids and make it started tory and justify things like restraining orders on so it keeps them from having to go through that process like recognize it's really rare that two kids are sexting or having sex in their sent to jail because of the same age like no one cares enough to report them at that point
We should lower the age of consent	This means more and more immersion in sex before you are old enough to even conceptualize it, what it might be government is right, you can't remove all the influences, but you can definitely not add to that fire by removing the age of consent society has gone far enough with sexual icing young women
We should ban beauty contests	And we think that that kind of thing should not be banned in so far as women will still have to do things like be attractive for men on both sides of the house
We should ban beauty contests	The other side tells you that beauty pageant, subject women to the male gaze and encourage them to participate in patriarchal norms, but we think that it's quite possible that the women who participate in them are fully aware of the fact that they're being judged on their appearance, how could they not be and choose to participate in this because they see some potential for personal gain
Sex education should be mandatory	A teacher has an authority over children since it is his job to provide them with knowledge
We should ban beauty contests	We think things like facial features are also often just like in skin tone
We should adopt libertarianism	The reason why the government is a better actor in many cases them private actors is because there's democratic control over the government
We should disband ASEAN	So it's more likely that they're able to specialize and develop industries that can take advantage of other markets within easy on and two because of the access to economic development expertise recognize that many countries in AC on different levels of development, malaysia is pretty far along some other countries are not as far along
We should abolish the US Electoral College	But to all people, the government, the present, united states, is the president of new york in the president of iowa and the president of montana, and as such even if they don't win, the electoral college in every single state you're more likely to result with the president that has a transfer usual appeal than you otherwise would if you simply allowed for the popular vote to ensure that seventy percent of californians and seventy percent of new yorkers and up deciding who's going to be president of the united states that's, not fair to those inside the country that's, not there the vast majority of americans
We should subsidize biofuels	We think that ultimately even if you want to keep this money focused on climate change, things like providing for people who are displaced by climate change or cleaning up the damage of coal power plants, et cetera would all be better uses of this money that have more immediate tangible impacts for people on the ground thing, giving handouts to large corporations that make cars with bio fuel
We should ban cosmetic surgery	We think that every given person in society knows their own best interest and their own long term goals better than the government knows any individual goals, we think the government should probably intervene if there are harms to others or if people are grossly lacking in information but that's, not the case here no one else is harmed all deal more with this in just a minute, but no one else is harmed by you choosing to get facelift and in terms of access to information doctors are already legally obliged to provide you with a great deal of information
We should disband ASEAN	We say that disbandment creates huge uncertainty that harms investments it harms the stock market and that's why even if it is in is stagnating, we must things to think of ways to strengthen and improve its before we turn to disband
We should subsidize biofuels	So in this debate for arguing that the american government should not subsidize bio fuels, we have four points in this debate
We should legalize cannabis	We would say that if a legal guns were on average more dangerous than legal guns, there'd be no reason that the government should expand gun access to individuals who would otherwise be prevented from buying a legal gun, we think that once individuals have consented to the harms of a legal action by ignoring the rule of law, they ought to get what is coming to them
We should lower the drinking age	But the problem in lowering the drinking age, the legal drinking age to eighteen or two sixteen is that it subsequently will lead to the lowering of the fact though age this kids start drinking too, like fourteen or fifteen and that's already something that side government would also agree that is on like preferable so here's what we say, basically the legal definition of who is a minor in who is an adult will forever be random, whether we set it at twenty one or eighteen or sixteen, it is clear and obvious that it won't really apply equally to everyone
We should ban cosmetic surgery	We could get that surgically done so I'm someone who's going for breast implants likely is not I'm someone who's already putting in like, brought padding on a daily basis
We should disband ASEAN	We say two things to that a all of this is also true in other unions, for instance, in the european union, there are different countries with different histories, different cultures, different languages
We should lower the drinking age	But if you will lower the drinking age to such a rate that is just legal for children to do with their own volition, parents can't make that decision for them
We should adopt libertarianism	Why is such that we have the social benefits of government regulation and control that we need to solve pro found the problematic like the actual problems
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	The two claims made by side government in favor of abolishing the security council's veto rights are that it is unfair and that it harms the efficacy of the wind here's the thing we completely agree that that's exactly what happens in case of harming the efficacy of the when we simply think that this is accidents
We should ban anonymous posts	This is a problem then because it is very difficult to enforce a law like this on a site that itself is already in violation of the law by virtue of its own existence
We should ban beauty contests	So a lot of ways you can make it harder for women to get jobs if you bad UT contest that would be very good and for all of those reasons among others were incredibly proud to oppose this motion
We should further exploit wind power	So it can disrupt like bird migration patterns, and it can kill birds that's, like a widely documented thing and that's not good because birds are important
We should further exploit wind power	But at the point in which you're making a decision to axe blade wind power that over something that's cheaper, but more environmentally destructive like oil or natural gas, then you probably have the capability to invest in alternative forms of green energy, besides when our so things like solar energy, your hydro electric energy
Physical education should be mandatory	We think it's just not the case that it is so difficult for kids to find space to go outside and play and run, but more than this, we think that it is important to note that if we are caring about the long term relationships that children have with athletics and their bodies, then what matters is that these relationships are healthy I'm going to give you to our use of clash first on alienating children and second on how there are more important things for children focused on
We should abolish intellectual property rights	And the reason for this is because I'm, if we want people to say create music, people are going to be able to spend their lives creating music or art or things like that unless you give them a way to make money off of that
We should lower the age of consent	But I want you to recognize the implications of a lower age of consent is that you also lower the age of the kind of like margin of error or standard deviation on that consent, which means his side of the house is having like fourteen year
We should adopt libertarianism	This fundamentally is the reason why other more obvious crimes like save murder or theft or a legal because even if the theft is something that I personally find pleasurable, the person being robbed, probably doesn't enjoy it that much, but we also think regulation is necessary because of information asymmetry is, for example, labeling on out food might be something of an inconvenience for food producers, but because people can't be expected to just offhand the ingredients in a twinkie, we think it's necessary to allow people to have conf informed consent that is be capable of making rational decisions themselves by giving them the information needed
We should abolish intellectual property rights	I think that the first issue that we need to identify here is what we mean by intellectual property rights, I think it's clear that we're talking about things like patents and trademarks and copyrights and not just something as simple as movie rights, and the like
We should abolish the US Electoral College	So it's a balancing factor it's, a system of the checks and balances that were created internally to the u s government it'll, it ensures that those big states get greater representation in a way that the otherwise don't in the senate, which means that in the highest office, those states are balanced out by the fact that in the senate they don't get as much of a voice as many think they should
We should further exploit wind power	But for the most part, you don't need that many like staffers that you don't need like a coal plant, for example, that really drives in industry from the resource extraction in the running of the plant, like it's, not like that wind power really just doesn't have that many jobs associated with it
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	Maybe a few reasons why we think the should be kept around broadly
Bullfighting should be banned	Fighting should not be that in this round, we're going to make two main arguments
We should abolish the US Electoral College	It provides people with you like firm state of closure on and like just sensually generalizes across the nation in a way that you couldn't and so we also think it allows for like smaller errors
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	But next would like to point out that the u when is explicitly founded for peace and not a quality recognize that every country in the u n has one vote in the general assembly in this is regardless of the fact that tongo probably has four thousand citizens and china has one point
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	Two billion citizens there's, nothing democratic about it on top of that many of the representatives are chosen by dictators on
We should lower the age of consent	And the age of consent is created to protect against it older men and women will always be more experience and be able to leverage emotional power against the younger people, they're sleeping with combine this oftentimes with financial power
We should ban partial birth abortions	But because people don't like doing it all the reasons that gov explains to you as to why this is a very visceral thing that people aren't wild about are also reasons why people don't like to do with themselves this isn't, something that happens frequently, but we think that it's only used in extreme circumstances where it's exceptionally necessary where there really isn't another option
We should lower the age of consent	What we mean by this is we don't think there's any reason to prosecute say a sixteen year old, if they're having sex with a fifteen year old significant other or something like that, like he's close age ranges, we think that there can be a great experience relationships between individuals that are of similar ages maybe around two years, we think that this can ensure that you are punishing callous individuals that are abusing those that are younger and you're allowing people to have meaningful sexual relationships and learn about their sexual selves and mature in a sexual manner
We should ban partial birth abortions	And we think that at that point that there is a, you know, a significant reason to to value the our actual rights claims the couple forts to fetuses but let's even to see that they do do you feel that pain, I think you do have to wait this then against the harms that are inflicted upon the mother in the situations
We should legalize cannabis	We think that although ballot initiatives in some u s states have allowed the states to legalize marijuana, they're still huge public debate
We should ban beauty contests	I stand and firm opposition to the motion that we should ban beauty pageants, although my opponent would like to discuss at length, how beauty pageants reinforce an entrenched problematic beauty standards, so unclear how these standards will ever be solved, simply by banning beauty pageants
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	Ultimately, we didn't have another war in europe on the scale of world war, two because both countries are able to veto changes to the balance of power or to the status quo, which would have put their backs to the wall
We should ban cosmetic surgery	One of those conditions would be say an asymmetry of information that causes direct harm upon the individual because medics surgery doesn't do that you doctors that inform you about what's going to happen with that cosmetic surgery, and the vast majority of cosmetic surgery is safe
We should ban cosmetic surgery	And even if it's the case that they should love themselves it's, not the case that people always do
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	This is often about severely impeding other people's existence because of your actions
We should further exploit wind power	They don't really need need maintenance wind turbines on the other hand, are going to have to be continually upgraded in order to meet our requirements for new energy and it's, not as simple as just attaching a bigger rotor
We should lower the age of consent	So for all three of these reasons we should not lower the age of consent
Physical education should be mandatory	So first, I think it's important to recognize that bad contact is worse than no contact because the assumption of the first speaker is that these children are going to have such an amazing time running around outside in doing sports they're going to come back hungry for more and we'll have that form this into the future
Physical education should be mandatory	Anyway, they do attendance for another five minutes than you do like you like mass around for other ten minutes, probably like at the end of the day, you're, not really doing all that much additionally p, e, oftentimes isn't all that enjoyable for people and it's not that enjoyable for people because different people like to exercise in different ways
We should ban fraternities	But but nevertheless exist in an informal capacity off campus, because, like, obviously you can stop people from getting houses off campus with their friends and having people over and you can't stop people from just like associating with other people as individuals off campus that's, like a clear like constitutional issue, their freedom of association
We should ban cosmetic surgery	This is why the damn things such as murder assault staff to all these types of things these things that we typically think of crimes we think of his crimes and it's when someone doesn't action and vokes their freedom, but in doing so removes or hinders the freedom or cracks a direct third party harms necessarily through their actions, not by accident but necessary, you know, the unnecessary aka the murders that someone else is dead up for finally, there could be some sort of overwhelming good of the community
We should abolish intellectual property rights	So I think the status quo is perfectly capable of solving for the harms that are described by side government right, but I don't even more fundamental level
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So what happens now is that you have younger children going out and getting cosmetic surgery, recognize that oftentimes parents will want their kids to perform in beauty pageants, or there are like racial stereotypes, individuals want to avoid like model of surgeries
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So it seems ridiculous then to a band of this sort of plastic surgery on the basis that it perpetuates misogynist norms, even other things that are linked specifically into beauty standards can have different justifications
We should abolish the US Electoral College	We also think that what this means is that you need to be continually providing an incentive for information to be disseminated
We should legalize cannabis	First, is that in a legal market, their advertising incentives to create perceptions of marijuana that are on realistic
We should abolish intellectual property rights	You can use it, you know, just as a physical thing that you know, makes your life better because you're able to use that idea to create new things
We should lower the drinking age	Moreover, we think that consumption is on regular bowl on both sides of the house
We should abolish intellectual property rights	Add I don't think that's something that you can get back
We should ban partial birth abortions	I think even when weighed against whatever pain, the fetus might feel ball being a port in that is minimal when compared to aid this is stained on like the sustained pains that the mother has felt, but secondly, on the increased rights valuation that we afford to the mother at that point, then it seems like the the price analysis invariably favors the mother in these situations
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	The problem is that the u s actually has a decent amount of states that will just do whatever they tell them to do israel's, obviously they go to example of this, but there are lots and lots of other states that if the US was to just act even a small amount of leverage against them, they would just bow to pressure
We should abolish intellectual property rights	And the last thing I'd like to talk about is why we need to reward people for creativity in the first place
We should lower the age of consent	The only thing that we're truly defending is a strict age of consent at eighteen year, olds eighteen years old to me, there is of clash the first on the promotion of centralization of youth by these kinds of loss
We should adopt libertarianism	So what libertarians proposed to do is have those services, but have them value the lowest weight possible, and whenever possible always defer to individual property rights, but I think is a problematic inception of the way to actually look at the world in a principled level, because you shouldn't look at property eyes, just some persons out it as an individual bit of property owned by a person rather you should look at it as a whole lot of collective factors went into making that property possible
We should subsidize biofuels	So we think that ultimately strong men like or like middle eastern shakes who rely on oil or forced to be more aggressive when you undermine the oil revenue and that this will be to international instability, which is a tremendous harm of this policy server these for reasons we would not subsidize bio fuels
We should lower the age of consent	Rather, we think that we need these laws in place for those edge cases for when people need to press charges or when someone is being truly abused, these systems are checks in a world where we hope we never have to use them more than this
We should adopt libertarianism	I think you wind up putting a lot of money into the pockets of people that already have money and saving it off of the people that need these public resources in order to do things like get to their work or get to a hospital or all these other things
We should lower the drinking age	And this is the next thing we want to talk about is that your body is still developing you're, much more likely to impair your mental development to impair your decision making process used to alcohol use while you are young than later in your life when your brain, your body has four more fully developed
We should lower the drinking age	They don't understand, they can't conceptualize what brain damage looks like, or what a lifetime of being addicted to alcohol might look like, and also we have to protect them until they can consent into those protect potential harms
We should ban anonymous posts	We think that often people need to maintain anonymity from a fear of retaliation against it opinions that are expressed for example, opposition view points on a thread that is like largely in favor of one particular position require individuals to be anonymous out of fear of like direct physical offline retaliation if I were to probe post like, for example, a pro hillary post on like our slash that donald it probably wouldn't go over too well and anonymity is necessary then for me to comfortably express myself in that forum
We should ban beauty contests	First, I think that it is not the case that beauty pageants is just a are yes, pretty women here in there, kind of thing I think often times it comes up as like a showcase of regional international or like local beauty
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	So a principle justification so right in the end of the previous speakers speech he says something about people needing to have a ministry and ill intention in order to break the law, but that is also not precisely the case we say that there are some laws that don't require in the line, intense, namely negligence laws, and we think that this is very similar to this case we're going to justify HBO's as something akin to negligence in cases of negligence you can be criminally liable for your actions because you failed to meet the standards that society where the court for that matter define as the standard of the reasonable person
We should adopt libertarianism	And I think that libertarianism doesn't really focus so much on those ends as much of the focus is on the means as much of the focus is on the right to not have ski intervention, a right to own your property as does inherit goods being more valuable than me
We should ban beauty contests	This is obviously a gradual situation, but we believe that then within a few generations, we will most definitely be there
We should ban partial birth abortions	The utility to a potential life that is a human because it has the potential to become human because being human is about being able to continue to grow as a human, not only does the government, not make a lot of sense and rely on it
We should abolish the US Electoral College	Rachel points out many flaws in the system, such as that it isn't perfectly allocated according to popular will
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	We should abolish the security council veto in the status quo
We should adopt libertarianism	My third argument is the idea of regulation you cannot trust individuals to police themselves
We should ban cosmetic surgery	And second, we we think that cosmetic surgery is perfectly acceptable if it helps people improve their personal, which are so aren't that on just we would say that the state is a massively course of body, it has the power to wield immense influence over people's lives because it has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force within its borders
We should further exploit unconventional oil	And because you can get high concentrations of higher concentrations of mercury as a result of that, but in addition to the direct harms of fracking there's also incredibly prominent in direct harms that come from fracking, namely that further dependence on oil and other non renewable sources of energy like it are very unclean source of energy will only further on lead to more global warming and climate change
We should ban cosmetic surgery	Our first independent point, which I think really cuts to the meat of almost everything that government tells you is that specifically banning cosmetic surgery on the basis that it perpetuates misogynist norms is itself blaming women and victims broadly arm for the you know, damage that is inflicted upon them when we hear from government specifically the line that we need to ban cosmetic surgery, you know, because this is this socially harmful practice that can drives artificial beauty norms
We should lower the drinking age	We also think that you can educate both sides of the house it's, not just when you don't ban any alcohol or don't don't have any drinking age that you can tell people that alcohol is dangerous, winning that our side of the house will have a higher leak will have any real drinking age probably around eighteen and even still have massive informational campaigns starting at a younger age that tells you about the damage that alcohol can calls with that too many areas of clash
We should subsidize biofuels	We think it's incredibly problematic that we remove alternative forms of fuel, then by a fuel and regular gasoline
Physical education should be mandatory	Some people may want to just run other people may want to like a basketball other people may want to play like four square or oddly field, like hot, like there's endless ways in which people can like acted like be active, physically I'll, send he has like a mandatory class if necessarily requires it, either aid be structured and like boring and unified, which is going to make a lot of people think that working out is boring thing that they don't enjoy or be it's, just going to lead to like this decentralized chaos where people can just kind of like, use the time to talk to friends wall like walking around the track outside, which is in actually helping anyone
We should ban anonymous posts	So let's start with that about why this is ultimately doomed to failure
We should lower the age of consent	We don't think that the point of these laws is to prosecute to fifteen year old to decide that they want to have sex or to juniors in high school who decide they want to have sex
We should ban cosmetic surgery	I think that the government would point out to you that cosmetic surgery is involved in a large series of norms that are problematic to the average person that they perpetuate body problem
We should lower the age of consent	And this is most true at these young ages that we're talking about in environments such as high schools we can but there's an immense amount of pressure to be sexually active under stand yourself in a sexual way, and this pushes people and having relationships that they otherwise wouldn't be likely to have because they feel that type of pressure we think that by having a higher age of consent you make it less likely that people are going to take these types of actions because there could be legal repercussions to it
We should ban partial birth abortions	Now tied down to all of these kinds of all of the basic reasons why we want to make sure that abortions are cheap, saving accessible to women in the first place all of those factors are just as president, no matter when the abortion is happening
We should further exploit wind power	We think that this further decreases the efficiency of wind power and makes it incredibly difficult to actually power whole cities as such the other more reliable from technology will have to be adopted
We should ban cosmetic surgery	This is a feeling of shame that escorts you everywhere you go even when you are alone, every mirror mirror becomes your enemy
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	My second argument is the effect on small states because we believe this will create huge amounts of infighting between smaller states in the united nations as they are now passing policies which have dramatic implications, and they are targeted by the you and they're likely to leave it is unlikely the unlikely that the u n will conduct a large scale ground operations against any state unless they're committing genocide, and as such there is very little risk to leaving if you're being targeted through declarations and hollow threats
We should lower the age of consent	This happens among other things because sex sells and because there are financial interests plea and they are happening way faster than the physical adaptations that are required to lake that's that to require an actual evolutionary bay all that like biological process
We should ban beauty contests	They also usually include a talent competition or some kind of physical competition
We should ban anonymous posts	We think this puts entire communities of individuals in a lot of danger like real names, linked to the private information of people which increases the amount of issues both with security and private well being that occur proud to oppose
We should abolish the US Electoral College	And it makes sense therefore, to create systems that ensure that the states won't just be ignored by the political system
We should adopt libertarianism	We have actually many things that we could say, but will focus on two for the purposes of the speech
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	I have two arguments in today's debate first, why it's preferable to jail and large fines and secondly, on how social determination is good, but first some free for bottle I for opponents first argument is that there's a right to be me, and I would agree there's, some right to be me in and out of shot, such we give the court's judicial independence and judicial jurisdiction and discretion which allows them to decide what is truly a criminal offense
We should ban beauty contests	We think that governments in general should only intervene to ban something or require something if it would make a meaningful difference in people's lives, if the net outcome of a policy is going to be the status quo, it would be better for government to just do nothing
We should abolish the US Electoral College	The first independent point is that there is a need for geographic representation that the electoral college uniquely provides
We should lower the age of consent	So I want to establish something quite clearly that the way the status quo looks is that if someone who is under age has sex with someone who is above the age of consent dot bomb by a considerable amount I'll get to the romeo and juliet laws in a little bit, but like for the meantime, let's recognize that it's a considerable gap in the status quo
We should ban cosmetic surgery	But secondly, on empowerment, what anything cosmetic surgery can actually be a good thing
We should ban beauty contests	So without mind, we think that given that this is just a symptom of that system we found that compared to other possible outcomes
We should ban cosmetic surgery	If you see cosmetic surgery is just a means by which men exert their will upon women and women's bodies than there are plenty of other mechanisms for doing that given that it seems unlikely that plastic surgery bands will actually solve this issue
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	But anyway, what's important here is that the united states and its allies invaded korea because the soviets couldn't veto it while they weren't participating in the united nations
We should ban cosmetic surgery	Moreover, who cares we recognize that money is the property of an individual and do not paternal lies the way in which the suspect because the standards for what is the useful expenditure versus not differs, depending on who is looking at the expenditure for some paying for a pact is a useless expenditure given that that part is not you tile to them, but for others, it is a very good expenditure because they gain a lot from having that pat cosmetic surgery is no different are secondary of clash has to do with cosmetic surgery as a form of empowerment
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So insofar as he's, not getting rid of that all he's doing is getting rid of one of the methods by which individuals can make themselves feel better
We should further exploit wind power	So we don't all die, but as far as choosing the best form of add ons, alternative energy, green energy, I think that wind power is vastly inferior to alternatives like solar energy for a couple of reasons
We should ban cosmetic surgery	These norms are created by other factors in society and people respond with cosmetic surgery to try and fit into those norms
We should ban beauty contests	My second overview is about the idea of government action government should not go in and ban anything that they feel is problematic
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	So specifically government takes issue with the broadness of these laws, but we think that that's good because of how difficult anti social behavior is depend down a lot of the time the specific action, the creates a nuisance is different, and as such it's hard to create a consistent law passed by the legislature in a timely fashion, the pro pro prickly responds to these public nuisances
We should further exploit wind power	We think that any attempt to fight global warming, which is generally unpopular will always fail, and as such ought not be adopted
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So the other team has to would actually solve the problems that they identify their correct that there are a lot of unfortunate harms to a culture that glorifies models and movie stars and then agree to ordinary looking people, but they don't have any way to make things better on their side of the house
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	In other words, there won't be a land war between the US and russia as long as they have the ability to control international acts through the UN security council
We should ban beauty contests	We are programmed to rate the other sex based on appearance
We should ban cosmetic surgery	And we think that not allowing people to do what they desire in restricting their freedom in this sense, is an unfair part of the society
We should ban anonymous posts	So this is specifically why we think that there's a proactive right to be anonymous on the internet
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	Secondly, though, with the principals don't actually matter if you buy my understanding of the principles, if you buy my points understand the principles, it doesn't matter because we should be fighting for the best world possible funding for pragmatic outcomes, rather than principles outcomes, which is not actually make people's lives better
We should adopt libertarianism	But I think that the state also to some extent has some kind of ownership over in society to some extent has done things like that society does things like create roads, you're able to make money creates like an economic regulation
We should further exploit unconventional oil	It means their access to clean water goes down in this is a basic necessity that these people need in order for their survival, and you don't think that it's necessary to adopt these types of these types of energy
We should ban cosmetic surgery	See if people are going to have to be more like new experience, awful side effects and that's only going to make any everything worse
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So we're gonna get two broad reasons for why we think it is unjust to ban cosmetic surgery
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	So if you think that the windows literally anything that is beneficial to little global structure it's important to keep the veto in place, our second independent argument is that increases incentives for clientelism on their side of the house
We should lower the drinking age	So when we say we should lower the drinking age, we don't necessarily need to you need to have long harsh punishments associated with under age drinking, you don't need to put people in jail for long periods of time that harm their prospects in the future harm their careers harm their livelihoods we're just saying that you should have laws in place so that you can address underage drinking and that underage drinking is a problem that needs to be addressed in a meaningful way through our laws
We should further exploit wind power	What the comparative in this round is we think that in the status quo often times different types of renewable energy resources in a free and open market compete for investments
We should abolish intellectual property rights	This is because they have the capacity to do so they have like the the human capital, the physical infrastructure that sort of thing to just build a product record, a song, whatever and just put it out on the market quicker, and as such if your idea gets noticed stolen because it's not protected by a legal structure, your small firm occurred, new artist, whatever gets crushed in the mean time and has no opportunity to break through because they're never going to introduce a product in a timely fashion that a bigger firm can't do quickly
We should subsidize biofuels	What I mean by this is that the reason we have pushes toward things like has a law or electric cars in general is because of increasing prices of fuel subsidizing bio fuel trying to make it a hip and cheaper alternative to all other forms of transportation will ultimately make it so things like electric cars or hybrid cars will fall in popularity
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	But additionally, we think this will generally just lead to worse relations between states if the one is now a political entity, which is passing horrific policies that will come at it as an object of opposition towards groups like NATO and other international bodies, which seat will see it as a press, seven problematic for this reason we should abolish we should not abolish the security council veto
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	This is the reason we live in the most peaceful time in history is that powerful countries around the world are unable to be forced into an untenable position by the international community
We should abolish intellectual property rights	Our third and final independent point is that it kills start ups on both in the tech world, and then just sort of like, generally like things like the music industry and the business world at large almost when property rights aren't protected, usually the thing the firm that can bring a product to the market first is the bigger more powerful one
We should further exploit wind power	Our third and final independent point is that when power has limited, use from a geographic perspective, it has to be somewhere where there actually is a significant and I'll of wind enough to justify the construction of these fairly expensive apparatuses as a result than we think that this is largely technology
Physical education should be mandatory	We think the problem with opening got here is that they assume that school is the only place where you can encourage physical activity or teach children healthy relationships with their bodies
We should adopt libertarianism	They are just put into this very unfortunate circumstance, three, no fault of their own and punished for it throughout their life
We should adopt libertarianism	These two inevitable economic destruction, such as this in two thousand eight novel abuses by the powerful and a system, which is essentially a vacuum where other powerful actors can take the reins to the harm of all society for this reason, we should not adopt libertarianism
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So in the status quo dot, when you go in for breast implants, a doctor will tell you how big you can go without it being uncomfortable for you so like physical back pain and like, like physical problems with long term recovery, but when you have a black market, those kinds of safety walls are going to be infinitely less available and infinitely less used
We should ban fraternities	So obviously, like you can't just like fully regulate these kinds of behaviors on it's simply impossible thing to do, and it would be an unfair thing to do because ultimately fracking gauge in similar behaviors to a lot of other entities
We should ban cosmetic surgery	We also just think the problem on their side of the house is that like if the person cares enough they'll find a way to do it, even if it's not the black market like things like waist, trainers can have awful affect your health bilik shifting your bones around in a way that like a regular tummy talk never would second the we want to talk about research benefits because recognize that because there is more money in cosmetic surgery so rich people pay more money so they can look prettier than a lot of the time it actually the discoveries made actually flow over to the areas that have less money
We should abolish intellectual property rights	And as a result, you just lose your infrastructure necessary to create these things
We should ban fraternities	Guess what we're going to create finals clubs are institutionalized with all of your best donors, so that we can get away with this ring of the situations are even worse, because now they don't need university support to exist they're, essentially divested themselves from university infrastructure rely on massive donors to the university, just want to piss off either
We should ban beauty contests	So it's unclear to us why this is absolutely unique from any other kind of thing, except that it now adds another layer of like also who do we think subtractive
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	And things of this sort are meant to curb the government's ability to exercise its power swiftly and easily
We should legalize cannabis	Insurance companies under, you know, things like pre existing condition, lawson, like right to choose laws and things like that cannot deny people covered all the bases that they smoke pot that's important because it means the premiums go up because there are more things that some insurance companies have to solve for when you have to internalize the harms that are created on the public health network by the people who are smoking pot, it disproportionately likely to have medical complications society at large has to bear those burdens because of the increased premiums you have to get the money from somewhere and fifth is that it is a gateway drug
We should further exploit wind power	We think that there are two better alternatives in regards to renewable energy sources that we should exploit instead of wind power given the fund abilities and the limits of spending in the status quo
We should lower the age of consent	We should not lower the age of consent, given the way that these laws are both enforced and the necessity for these laws in reality
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	And so we think that given that it is often harder for people to leave situations in which they are uncomfortable but easier for you to make sure that that space is comfortable, the whole time deferred to the latter for these reasons allow these kinds of acts to be used for these reasons, proud to oppose
We should abolish the US Electoral College	The president at that point, we don't think that the system should be changed, especially when many other countries which use a popular vote system have had few were transitions of power peacefully, war of have been much more prone to civil conflict due to their electoral systems
We should ban cosmetic surgery	It may be a bit of an alteration to your body, but I have a lot of ways like it similar to maybe something like a tattoo is something that's, permanent, a last forever
We should adopt libertarianism	We should not adopt libertarianism, because I think on both principal and on a practical level of how the world works libertarianism is a rather flawed ideology, so let's start by talking about what actually defines libertarianism
We should lower the drinking age	And we think that we ought be preventing cues from entering that world for us long as possible for these reasons, proud to oppose
We should ban cosmetic surgery	But this is also even something that I think people can generally do with pretty good information because when you're considering getting plastic surgery, it's not like doctors are allowed to not tell you the possible risks of surgery on their usually required by law to talk to you about safety affect us possible side effects of surgery, things like that
We should further exploit unconventional oil	We think it's best to invest as much as possible, but be investments in infrastructure, create long term, economic dependency himself, said we're going to bring jobs back to north america and back to canada, or whatever note the power of potatoes in iowa just because they have so many jobs and there it is politically near impossible to get rid of entire fields of labor in democratic countries
We should lower the age of consent	First of all, for the children that are born often times, they have to be put up for adoption
We should adopt libertarianism	Secondly, we think that diminishing marginal returns important concept of economics also apply to income
We should ban fraternities	So there's, really nothing that you could actually do about banning fraternities in an off campus, informal capacity
We should ban cosmetic surgery	Then we think that a world with plastic surgery is preferable in so far as it allows women to take ownership over their bodies in escape the discriminatory structures that are often flung at women who are seen as less conventionally attractive
We should lower the age of consent	Okay, so what's important to recognize is that, in addition to not lowering the age of consent, you can also create an age of consent that is high but isn't done in a core or callous fashion
We should further exploit unconventional oil	All these things come with immense economic harms and a metahuman costs as well, and all of these things are directly linked to climate change, global warming and are therefore directly linked to a continued use of renewable energies
We should ban partial birth abortions	This puts the mother at potentially great risk if she is part of a botched abortion or if there's an infection or if there are complications so we think that in reflection of the safety of the mothers, many of whom may be relatively young, we should keep this safe and legal rather than ban it said that it goes to the black market for all these reasons we should not ban partial birth abortions
We should further exploit wind power	I don't really think that this is necessarily a comparative between whether we should act weight
We should ban fraternities	So really the comparative is would you rather have for attorneys be on campus in a more regular fashion
We should ban cosmetic surgery	We wonder therefore are they also in favor of banning make up high heels, what about libel section surgeries, what about going to the dentist to make your teeth whiter, but about tattoos we say that all of these examples are also like following from the logic of the analysis of side government
Physical education should be mandatory	The reason why physical education shouldn't be mandatory isn't because exercises bad all the isley exercise is a good thing if anything people clearly don't do it and nothing, the status quo
We should ban anonymous posts	So they don't have a community to access anonymous posting lets people safely talk about identities that are marginalized or discriminated against
We should lower the drinking age	So if you let people drink at eighteen error at yeah at eighteen and then they start drinking, actually at like, fifteen or sixteen than those information that lack of ability to access meaningful information on the practice is even greater
We should lower the age of consent	Now we think that this is probably because people don't think that thirteen year old should be having sex for some of the reasons that I told you about earlier, they might be concerned about protecting young people from predations by older people or they might just be concerned that their sons and daughters are going to make poor decisions either way
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	First on why this is simply a good intermediate tool for law enforcement to use given that on the given that without it
We should ban partial birth abortions	I think both of these justifications though are important because they don't change with the time in freeman, which you're actually applying the abortion like if the fetus doesn't hop right it's it's because they don't have consciousness or because you know a potential person and probably just isn't worth as much as an actual person in terms of how we apportion life
We should ban cosmetic surgery	So we think that the danger that comes to individual also through a hygiene perspective, like the use of dirty materials, etcetera is much higher
We should lower the age of consent	So the next up reason why this is bad is because of safety concerns so miners oftentimes have much more difficulty accessing not just being informed about healthy sexual education, but having access to sexual education as well
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	Ultimately, we think that one reason why vigilante violence is almost unheard of now in much of the developed world is because people have so much access to records through the courts
We should abolish the United Nations Security Council veto power	The purpose of the united nations is not to pass a variety of policies and be a global super government is to create treaties and create cooperation between states by having a security council veto or the largest states can stop problematic policies from going through what we do is guaranteed that the united nations for filled with calls anne's purpose with that in mind, I have two arguments
We should ban anonymous posts	And our final point is about boxing a serious concern in many online communities is that people will release the real identities of anonymous posters when you ban anonymous posting effectively, you docks everyone suddenly all of the posts made previously by anonymous users are going to be attached to a name, even if the person made them under the impression that those posted remain anonymous and moral for anyone who was a free to being docks will now be unable to make similar posts in the future, whether they be closeted or politically subversive because now effectively, everyone is stocks
We should abolish intellectual property rights	They try to tell you would, you know, things like music, for example, are like the composite of like long long kinds of history and like work that came before it, I think there's a couple problems as first is that the way we combine things is it itself unique right, like I pick up a rock and pick up some water, and I make some cool thing of the combination of those two things that is the meaning flee new thing, and I put in labor

We should ban beauty contests	So we think at the point where government is confusing the chicken and the egg, I don't think you get rid of sexism by getting rid of beauty pageants
We should ban cosmetic surgery	Our second independent point is that this essentially allows women to have ownership over their bodies, the can mitigate the effects of the sexist society all get into this more in a bit, but I want to establish that sexist norms are going to exist on either side of the house
We should abolish anti-social behavior orders	So ultimately, we think it's time that we believe these people that something is wrong and try to do something to help them rather than just say, oh, well, you should just avoid this person it's ridiculous to put the burden to avoid someone on someone who's been a victim and moreover, for some of these behavior orders that affect property, it might literally be impossible to keep someone out of your property if you don't have this legal protection

Sex education should be mandatory	In fact, the ninety nine percent of the cases we are not even certain that you really need the parents or the teachers in order to explain this to high school children, they wanted in movies and on television, the hear about it from older siblings or friends that have older siblings, just like them says and it's just really basic common knowledge, and you know what that's fine we don't really need all of the most professional details
We should ban fraternities	And I don't think that getting rid of france is actually going to change a whole lot as far as like the way that like women feel safe on campus, probably much more effective would be just like trying to make it so that men are less likely to be problematic, rather than just trying to ban organizations that part that might contribute to these kinds of things are not really attacking the root cause of the problem you're just kind of attracting like attacking a symptom of it or like a method of it, but I think also beyond that, obviously, there's other organizations that operate similarly, there is teasing and like parties and things like that for sports teams like on other clubs and things like that do that to like the brand is to beat teams from parties before like

We should further exploit unconventional oil	We think that we would rather use methods that are going to do in the future of our planet that I'm going to do in future societies

Physical education should be mandatory	And the reason for that is the parental consent is your key to ensuring the best interests of the child

We should ban cosmetic surgery	Rather, it will simply place the blame and the onus of responsibility for victimization for off work for perpetuation of problematic norms on the victims themselves and drive home, the notion that it's sort of like the stereo type of like the vapid blonde women or whatever it is really the one to blame for misogyny when nothing could be further from the truth
We should legalize cannabis	The united states has pushed its ideas and pushed its policy on the world at large states have adopted strong anti drug policies as a result of the united states influence and now it's been pushed into the rule of law in those states and been determined to be the societal good as I discussed in my overview

We should further exploit wind power	So the sun is just an infinitely stronger source of energy than the way like I like the wind is fine, but the sun has a lot more energy like the problem with solar energy right now is we're, not in the top a lot of the potential energy, but that's the point potential energy

We should ban fraternities	So we think that ultimately you really undermine your ability to raise money in the future by banning fraternities
We should abolish the US Electoral College	I need the electoral college in that regard because it provides a capacity to ensure that small states to just get bulldozed by like new york, california and texas, all the time it's really important to ensure that like little wyoming actually has its voice heard in people at the federal level actually care about the opinions of people from wyoming given that we think it's really unfair to adopt a system that is almost certain to just completely ignore whatever the will of you know why omens are so our second independent point is fraud that fraud is easier to commit or popular vote in the reason for this is that under the electoral college, your system for voting is divided into silos that is lots of different individual parables systems that you vote in
Sex education should be mandatory	Education, mandatory our first independent point is that this will likely lead to worse sex education
We should ban partial birth abortions	But now I've just changed my mind that is rarely the case that is almost never the case we are talking about are specific types of cases where the mother's at risk either physically or emotionally or the fetus is at risk, or the mother's simply didn't know she was pregnant until it is too late to have any other kind of abortion

We should further exploit wind power	You have a lot more on animal life in the area like in shallow waters
We should further exploit unconventional oil	Before you reach up further tipping point, we think that even if you are able to get unconventional oil in a clean way, even if you're able to do it without destroying ecosystems you're only adding to the problem in the status quo you're, only allowing for more dirty energy to be produced, which we think is unacceptable is unacceptable is only going to lead to dramatic harms for the future of society for future people
We should abolish intellectual property rights	And second, I think that intellectual properties are important to ensure that we are it she's positive outcomes that we maximize innovation and we maximize creation up things that people value from and people appreciate so what's more by talking about the rights claims that we have here, I think it's important to note that if you create a song or if you write a book or if you come up with a work of art or a logo or anything like that, these are things that you created there are no different than saying he I if you spend your money on a plot of land or on a house or something like that
We should further exploit unconventional oil	We tell you that ultimately, the huge drop in oil prices globally has done more to harm ordinary people living in petroleum states that it's done to their governments

We should ban cosmetic surgery	So given that that's the case we're gonna talk about two reasons why you should not ban cosmetic surgery
We should ban beauty contests	I think the problem with a lot of putting danny says is that he talks about why this might reinforcer propagate a system of sexual lies ation of women, etcetera, but he does not explain why it is inherent to that system

We should ban cosmetic surgery	We think that even if it is like marginally problematic that women get get on, get like adjustments to their labia because they're told that long libya's are bad, we think it is still not positive that they then feel more confident in the bedroom and more confident with their own bodies so that they can actually be intimate with another person more than this
We should lower the drinking age	So we think that you have to protect them first because they don't because consuming alcohol can physically prevent them from being able to function in the long term we also talk about the long term habits that it creates when you start bringing young, it also means you're starting habits and addictions early on
We should adopt libertarianism	So we think that it's important that the state intervene at every level necessary to be sure that people's constitutional rights are actually accessible to them, and I mentioned the gilded age because I think that that is the alternative here in early twentieth century america or britain there were very few protections for ordinary people basically no social welfare net
We should abolish intellectual property rights	This is bad both for corporations, but also for the consumers because they can no never trust whether a brand is actually what it says that it is or not for these reasons, proud to propose, oppose
We should abolish intellectual property rights	Our first independent point is principled that is that we think there is an actual property rights claim to intellectual property, and that there is a principle justification for preserving back right, so I think generally we respect property rights because we see property is an extension of the self that is awesome autonomy
We should further exploit wind power	And the first reason for this is that setting up wind farms is bad for the sub for like habitats of certain animals

We should ban beauty contests	This is incredibly true of the like situation of beauty pageants because such a ban assumes that women are not aware of the possibilities of a justification or that women are not aware of the possibilities that this could come with like adverse harms if people look at them the wrong way and therefore women are not like comfortable are capable of making decisions on themselves as for how they present their body to the world
Physical education should be mandatory	I am proud to oppose the motion that we should make physical education, mandatory in schools, our first independent point is that this is a violation of parental rights
We should disband ASEAN	We think that because any person would always choose to live in the most developed country possible so that they have the highest quality of life does with the ability to do so those to reap the benefits of develop life because there it leads should try to provide it to everyone else to sort of do unto others as you would have them do unto you type of thinking we see that development is more likely with AC on one because countries have more access to trade partners and trade goods
We should abolish intellectual property rights	But if you never get to work that concept in the first place, you're never going to be able to get more specific either

We should ban cosmetic surgery	People harpies believes about themselves, and they can't just choose to feel good about their bodies

We should ban anonymous posts	So we don't think that these sites are going to comply, but even with regards to other sites like facebook and you know, like they talk about like four chan for example, I think there is one the problem of international enforcement that is that these sites exist across state borders, so it will be extremely difficult for individual governments to make these requirements
We should abolish the US Electoral College	So in the status quo, the united states is comprised largely of a group of really big states that make up the majority of its population and a lot of small states
We should ban partial birth abortions	So for all these reasons do not ban partial birth abortion
We should lower the drinking age	These children are likely to get their understanding of alcohol from things like media from how much their parents strike, but if they ever tried to consume that much alcohol, particularly shots in a short amount of time, they could easily get alcohol poisoning

We should ban cosmetic surgery	Ultimately, we don't see why cosmetic surgery is the one place we all draw the line, particularly when it's conducted by a doctor who presumably can maximize the safety of the procedure, but on top of that, we think that you should always preference more freedom for individuals
Sex education should be mandatory	So like, for example, they just for some hapless gym teacher in there that you know, it's such as like this guy that doesn't understand how the pill works in so they give actively bad advice that actually it increases problematic sex ghetto like activities and doesn't actually educate people properly or secondly, they have larger structures that are structurally harmful like abstinence only sex education, which statistically increases teen pregnancy and STD rates armed to the point where you have these this counterfactual
We should ban partial birth abortions	We should not ban partial birth abortions so we're going to argue that abortion should not be limited to the first trimester or the first half of pregnancy, but rather that it should be allowed very late in the pregnancy I'm, not sure about the medical implications of extremely late abortions
We should ban cosmetic surgery	If someone has the funds to have cosmetic surgery done to them, and they have some sort of particular thing that they think will make them feel better

We should ban cosmetic surgery	First on preference, I think we all remember that people should be as free as possible in
We should adopt libertarianism	And I think that's very important because that changes the evaluation from if we're trying to say tax, somebody higher is this a matter of the rights violation verses helping people not starve, maybe or is this a do or is this instead of to beat out of, you know what the state has a right to this any some this anyway
We should lower the age of consent	Why is the case individuals, particularly children have a greater respect for the rule of law, both because of the inherent reference that they have for older individuals who passed these kinds of laws also because they have greater fears of things like prison and other punishment by lowering the age of consent will increase the amount of individuals willing to have sex in the first place will also signaling to children that sex should be had at a younger age than they are comfortable with this will lead to it increased pregnancies and increased stds given that these children do not have the best understanding of birth control or the best understanding of STD prevention, which is incredibly problematic
We should ban beauty contests	We think that this needs to be weighed against the fact that women use their agency to make this decision about whether or not they're going to participate in beauty contests and we think that your contents can have positive impacts for the women that choose to participate in them
