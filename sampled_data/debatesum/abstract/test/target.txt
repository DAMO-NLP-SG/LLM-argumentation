Human rights in U.S.-China relations is a biopolitical transaction. The plan creates an economy of bodies between the U.S. and China – engagement causes select modifications in China’s policy, which necessitates that China jail more dissenters to replenish the national stock.

This CP replaces the Navy Ford class supercarriers with Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers. Squo naval strategy is to have three or four naval carrier strike groups deployed at any given time. Currently, the U.S. has 10 aircraft carriers, 11 if you consider the Ford carrier which won’t be operational till around 2018. Over half of these aircraft carriers are currently in port undergoing maintenance, with only two or three currently deployed overseas (https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1sBGyGlr10FgCE3ODmS-7GIgH7RI&hl=en_US). The idea is that having lots of carriers are a sign of US naval power, allow us to bully other countries, and reassure our allies. The CP overcomes the carrier gap by purchasing carriers from Britain so that there is no longer a shortage. To update this file, you should find some naval power KT U.S. heg cards. If you want to be lazy, maybe the oceans topic or college troop deployment files would be a good place to look.
