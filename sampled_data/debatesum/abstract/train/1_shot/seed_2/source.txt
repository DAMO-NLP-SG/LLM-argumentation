A viable policy toward this pathetic regime, then, might be to calm down while continuing to be extorted for the sake of the miserable North Korean people. Conceivably (but only conceivably), a reduction in the threat environment might nudge the North Korean regime into reducing its armed forces some, while spending more on its people. For the rest, one would simply wait for the leadership to come around. It might be a long wait, but getting hysterical over this regime and launching a war against it seems a far inferior option.
