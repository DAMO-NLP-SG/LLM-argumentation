While most examinations of Islamophobia suggest that it is only the most recent expression of American nativism -- made manifest after t 9/11 the history of using the fear of Islam as a tactic actually extends much further back. The first attacks on Islam in the Western Hemisphere had little to do with religion and more to do with suppressing Africans during slavery. As early as the 1500s, European colonial powers began passing anti-Muslim legislation to prevent importation of African Muslims, who were often involved in slave rebellions Islam came to signify a challenge to the authority of white slave owners and the state-sanctioned subjugation of African people.
Massive war?¶ Preliminary answer: Highly plausible A nano arms race appears almost inevitable, and would probably be unstable as discussed in the military capabilities study A nano-enabled war would probably be lethal to many civilians Military planners will seek a target that is large enough to find and hit, and that cannot be easily replaced. The natural choice, given the circumstances, will be civilian populations oth full-scale war and unconventional/terroristic war will target civilians, who will be nearly impossible to defend without major lifestyle changes. It would be easy to deploy enough antipersonnel weapons to make the earth unsurvivable by unprotected humans.
With the U S currently positioning itself as the technologically exceptional global counterterrorism expert, American exceptionalism feeds off of other exceptionalisms, particularly that of Israel, its close ally in the Middle East. The exceptional national security issues of Israel, and the long term ‘‘existential’’ threat it faces because of its sense of being ‘‘entangled in a conflict of unparalleled dimensions proceeds thus: ‘‘exceptional vulnerability’’ results in ‘‘exceptional security needs,’’ the risks of which are then alleviated and purportedly conquered by ‘‘exceptional counterterrorism technologies In this collusion of American and Israeli state interests, defined through a joint oppositional posture toward Muslims, narratives of victimhood suture claims to exceptionalism. In other words, the Israeli nation-state finds itself continuously embroiled in violence which is currently mirrored by U.S. declarations of possible terror risks used to compel U.S. citizens to support the war on terror The idea of empire has always entailed limits, a narrative of rising and falling, The denial and disavowal of empire has long served as the ideological cornerstone of U.S. imperialism achieves twofold results: the U S is not subject to empire’s shortcomings and the U S creates the impression that empire is beyond the pale of its own morally upright behavior violences of the state are seen as anything but empire a narrative of transcendence places the U S above empire a teleological narrative of inevitability’’ that posits America as the arbiter of appropriate ethics, human rights, and democratic behavior while exempting itself
Every time a protest breaks out in China, the outside world sees it as a sign that the communist regime is weakening Yet Chinese opinion polls consistently show strong public support for the central government in Beijing, despite the protests the protests can help the Communist Party gain support Recent high-profile incidents - such as the land dispute in Wukan, the mining plant dispute in Shifang, the waste water processing plant dispute in Qidong have generated considerable excitement among Chinese dissidents and some Western media outlets, who tend to describe them as the beginning of the collapse of the authoritarian regime But public opinion surveys conducted by Chinese and Western scholars, including a recent survey by the Washington-based Pew Research Center, show a persistently high level of support for the Beijing government Obviously, such strong support will not lead to the collapse of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) any time soon Part of the reason is the CCP's successful use of mass incidents to promote and consolidate its own power By shifting public anger to economic organisations, local governments and individual government officials, the central and provincial governments are bypassing normal judicial procedures and local bureaucratic institutions, and establishing direct dialogue with the public. In return, they gain people's trust and support Outside China, observers often view the internet as the hope for democracy, based on the assumption that it will effectively organise the public, break through news censorship and quickly disseminate information In China, however, the internet is often used as "human flesh search engine" to recklessly expose people's private information In the Wukan and Shishou incidents as well as others, many protesters held banners calling for direct intervention by Beijing, while condemning local officials. The response from the top satisfies those at the bottom and in return, produces political loyalty and support for the CCP. But this process moves China further away from civil society and democracy
Russia and the West drew a tentative line under the Ukraine crisis Obama and his allies agreed to hold off on more damaging economic sanctions unless Moscow goes beyond the seizure of Crimea. Obama was concerned at the possibility of further Russian "encroachment" into Ukraine and believed Putin was still "making calculations". The rouble firmed and Russian assets climbed on Tuesday after Obama and fellow G7 leaders held back from new sanctions and investors took the view that the crisis had been contained for now.¶ Lavrov said Russia did not intend to use force in eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, and "the two sides agreed not to fuel further escalation European diplomats said signs that Putin may have decided to go no farther than Crimea may reflect concern about the mounting economic consequences.¶
Over time and with increased demands to recognize distinct ethnic groups, federalism has emerged as a popular solution to manage and solve ethnic differences and conflicts. Power-sharing agreements between national and sub-national governments ideally will improve representation and political efficacy among numerous and diverse groups of citizens

The backlash to Taiwanese nuclear development could come from its foreign investors The US would halt all defensive weapon sales to the island as well as sever economic ties Economic sanctions against the ROC could be devastating Taiwan’s economy would suffer dramatically without American support The international fallout could be damaging Comparisons to Iraq and North Korea would be abundant Taiwan would suffer ostracism on all fronts
the relationship with China have downsides, including economic threats as well as China’s assertiveness , there are quite a few upsides in the US–Thailand alliance. Military-to-military interactions with the United States remain intact, thanks to a half-century of institutionalized relationships and interoperability. Thailand also has converging interests with the United States on regional stability and non-traditional security. HADR emerged as a promising field for cooperation between the two nations.
Even if CEQ explicitly clarified in the next iteration of the guidance that as a matter of law, appropriate consideration of climate change effects is required for the whole panoply of covered federal action it would truly be the exception that swallows the guidance. Over the past three years, based on the statistics available  proposed federal land and resource management actions account for the overwhelming majority of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs). From May 18, 2007 through May 7, 2010, 1,504 EISs (draft, final and supplemental) were filed with the EPA
