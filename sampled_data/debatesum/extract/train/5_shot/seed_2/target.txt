even assuming that the rate of proliferation will increase, the question remains: how many withdrawals are actually necessary to generate a mass exodus, thus terminating the treaty. Research shows that for every participant in an arrangement, the perceived necessary critical mass of partakers will be different, contingent on a number of specific impetuses this process could reach a threshold, beyond which nobody will continue to engage within the NPT. While who withdraws would surely play a key role, there is little reason to believe that a ‘point of no return’ can be reached with less than one-third of the participants abandoning the treaty it remains unclear how, on its own, such a step could destroy the treaty multiple withdrawals will surely be damaging to the NPT’s many attributes, but appear unlikely to be lethal. Even NPT analyses that suggest a grim outlook conclude that the critical mass necessary for the non-proliferation norm to decay would most probably be over 20 states
