Latin American markets are becoming increasingly valuable for Chinese companies because they allow the PRC to expand and diversify its export base at a time when economic growth is slowing . The region has also proven an effective market for Chinese efforts to sell more sophisticated, higher value added products in sectors seen as strategic, such as automobiles, appliances, computers and telecommunication equipment, and aircraft In expanding markets in Latin American the hopes of access to Chinese markets and investments among key groups of businesspeople and government officials in those nations have played a key role in the political will to overcome the resistance China has applied more explicit pressures to induce Latin America to keep its markets open to Chinese goods
I'm not sure a wave will necessarily mean the minority party will wrestle away control of the House. I'd argue a wave doesn't just need to be measured by seats won. It can be measured by votes won. It's on this score that Democrats are in a very strong position historically speaking. The problem for Democrats isn't lack of popular support. It's how that support gets translated into seats It's not unusual historically speaking for the minority party to need more than a majority of votes (cast for the two major parties) to win a majority of seats. That's because incumbents tend to outperform the national environment, and the majority party usually has more incumbents running. What is unusual about 2018 is how great the disparity is between votes and seats is likely to be because of geographic sorting and gerrymandering. Usually, the minority party would need to win the House popular vote by a few points to win control, not seven. It just strikes me as unreasonable to expect that Democrats to win a net gain of much more than 23 seats given the vote/seat disparity and that no minority party in a midterm in the modern era has done better than an 8.5-point popular vote win. If Democrats are able to do that, it would be extraordinary.
What makes anthropocentrism unavoidable is a limitation of a quite different sort, one which cannot be overcome even in principle because it involves a non-contingent limitation on moral thinking as such. the ineliminable element of anthropocentrism is marked by the impossibility of giving meaningful moral consideration to cases which bear no similarity to any aspect of human cases. The emphasis is on the ‘meaningful’ here: for in the abstract one could of course declare that some feature of the nonhuman world was morally valuable, despite meeting no determinate criterion of value already recognised by any human, but because the new value is completely unrelated to any existing value it will remain radically indeterminate as a guide to action. Thus features of humans remain the benchmark. As long as the valuer is a human, the very selection of criteria of value will be limited by this fact. It is this fact which precludes the possibility of a radically nonanthropocentric value scheme, if by that is meant the adoption of a set of values which are supposed to be completely unrelated to any existing human values. Any attempt to construct a radically non-anthropocentric value scheme is liable not only to be arbitrary – because founded on no certain knowledge – but also to be more insidiously anthropocentric in projecting certain values, which as a matter of fact are selected by a human, onto nonhuman beings without certain warrant for doing so. This, of course, is the error of anthropomorphism, and will inevitably, I believe, be committed in any attempt to expunge anthropocentrism altogether what is unavoidable about anthropocentrism is precisely what makes ethics possible at all t is a basic feature of the logic of obligation: if an ethic is a guide to action; and if a particular ethic requires an agent to make others’ ends her end Values are always the values of the valuer:3 so as long as the class of valuers includes human beings, human values are ineliminable
Switching the allegiance of disappointed socialists from the working class to so-called ‘new social movements’ must be considered far too premature and naive. Single issue movements, even if they fight for non-integrable causes, can be picked off and marginalized one by one, because they cannot lay claim to representing a coherent and comprehensive alternative to the given order as a mode of social metabolic control and system of societal reproduction. This is what makes focusing on the socialist emancipatory potential of labour more important today than ever before. For labour is not only non-integrable but — precisely as the only feasible structural alternative to capital — can provide the comprehensive strategic framework within which all ‘single issue’ emancipatory movements can successfully make their common cause for the survival of humanity
The ban – was set to go into effect March 16, making the 90-day mark June 14 Groups that oppose the ban say that rendered the ban moot If the travel restrictions really were designed to allow authorities time to review screening procedures, they contend, then it must not be needed after that point The Trump administration, however, maintained that a lower court's decision blocking the ban from going into effect also stopped authorities from reviewing vetting procedures in the six designated countries. In the administration's view, the 90-day period hadn't even begun This month, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction but narrowed it . That would mean that the 90-day period would still elapse before oral arguments in October.¶ It's a development that "may moot out most of the current controversy although there still may be challenges to another part of the executive order that allows DHS to make certain country-by-country determinations The 120-day suspension of the refugee program, meanwhile, would still be in effect it would be due to end by the end of the month after oral arguments.¶ regardless of when the bans are set to lapse, there's nothing stopping the administration from renewing or extending them – and that doing so may, in fact, be likely.¶ Unknowable."
A "government" is usually defined as the institution that holds a monopoly of legitimate coercive force within a defined territory. Such an agency of human power offers great potential advantages to its citizens, and great dangers too. ) generally argue that this plan reduces the dangers while increasing the benefits. Thus a federal system may be helpful in encouraging and preserving individual liberty citizens who feel aggrieved can appeal to more than one "final" authority, and they may also be able to move to a different state or province. Federalism may also provide a route to community autonomy, a value emphasized by groups of native peoples in the US and Canada a federal system may encourage active involvement by citizens, thus nourishing participatory democracy. Federalism also encourages each state or province to devise its own strategies for economic development -- strategies which may be more effective (because they are based on a closer understanding of local culture, resources and skills), and which, through the variety of different strategies tried by different states and provinces, may produce innovative programs whose success can then be emulated by other regions & nations for example in trying distinctive strategies to undertake stem-cell research, to obtain prescription drugs, to treat those who are dying, and generally in the field of social services states may serve as important "laboratories for experimentation".
China bashing has become as much a part of the modern American political tradition as criticizing foreign producers of oil The American electorate has regrettably become accustomed to the predictable torrent of anti-Chinese rhetoric from politicians of a variety of political persuasions currently manifested by the incendiary rhetoric of Donald Trump It is worth noting that China bashing actually makes little sense in terms of getting U.S. presidential candidates elected The top five U.S. states exporting to China by dollar volume in 2014 Bashing China is actually less likely to get a candidate elected, because the workers in these states have the most to lose economically by curtailing America’s economic relationship with China, and they know it.

allies and security partners in Asia and the Middle East would use America’s diminished military power and geopolitical influence as justification to pursue their own nuclear options. If Washington were perceived as acquiescing in any way to nuclear breakout by Tokyo or Seoul we should expect signatories of the NPT to cite discriminatory doublestandards and even quit the NPT. Likely candidates in the Middle East would include Saudi Arabia and other Arab Gulf security partners who are already threatened by Iran’s drive to rapid nuclear weaponsmaking capability Taiwan might be tempted to restart its reversed nuclear bomb-making efforts Australia may see prudence in developing a latent nuclear weapons-making capability. So might partners like Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam.

The treatment demonstrates the continuing use of authoritarian and arbitrary punishment of alleged sources of social unrest The use of the courts to punish activists is part of the broader campaign by the party-state to tighten control over society. Its focus on the media is clear: China was ranked 176th out of 180 countries One possible reason is that the party became preoccupied with the threatened collapse of the stock market and other financial problems, and the leadership did not want to risk raising social discontent in a society already beset with anxiety and doubts about prevailing policies. Whatever the cause, the handling of these cases demonstrates China’s use of the courts for purely political purposes.
a transnationalization of immigration policy may also derive from a convergence of state policies with common goals immigration policy has been transnational at least since the seventeenth century where it concerns blacks, and is evident even in periods when some of these nations had no black population of significant size Western efforts to exclude the phenotypically black amount to the construction of a global blockade to black migration and mobility in a form of transnationalization that significantly predates the forces of which Sassen speaks This article serves to re-insert ‘black’ as relevant category in the discourse on globalized, racialized immigration, and to refigure anti-black racism as a global immigration phenomenon. Despite differences among these nations’ histories, a transnationalization of anti-black sentiment in immigration law and policy in the Anglophone West began during the trade in enslaved Africans and continues today Western nations were ambivalent about the merits of using black labourers, soldiers and seamen in fortifying their economies and polities, yet at no time were they considered persons that merited inclusion in the democratic revolution that was taking place at the time black persons should only be temporarily used for their contribution, and once their usefulness was spent, co-dependency and collaboration in a transnational anti-blackness became more evident, even as we see the beginnings of ‘race-neutral’ laws with more obvious racializing outcomes. Where global anti-blackness operates without the use of overtly racist language, Western nations’ lawmakers can claim to have transcended racism while still managing to maintain racial hierarchies ). The contradictions of these efforts are pronounced in the most recent period, where a rights discourse, coupled with illiberal law and policy, continue to shape a racialized hierarchy of immigrants that may be seen as a ) enormously consequential anchoring of black persons to the bottom of the racial and ‘world systemic’ hierarchies
The best starting point for conceptualizing security lies in the real conditions of insecurity suffered by people and collectivities Look around What is immediately striking is that some degree of insecurity as a life-determining condition is universal The corollary of the relationship between insecurity and a determined life is that a degree of security creates life possibilities Security might therefore be conceived as synonymous with opening up space in people’s lives This allows for individual and collective human becoming the capacity to have some choice about living differently security can be understood as an instrumental value it frees its possessors to a greater or lesser extent from life-determining constraints and so allows different life possibilities to be explored security is not synonymous simply with survival One can survive without being secure Security is therefore more than mere animal survival It is survival-plus the plus being the possibility to explore human becoming As an instrumental value, security is sought because it free people(s) to some degree to do other than deal with threats to their human being The achievement of a level of security gives to individuals and groups some time, energy, and scope to choose to be or become, other than merely surviving as human biological organisms Security is an important dimension of the process by which the human species can reinvent itself beyond the merely biological
Education Beyond Capital80 The true nature of the struggle over schooling in the United States today is evident in the daily vilifying of teachers and teachers’ unions by the neoliberal school reform movement and the corporate media.81 Speaking to teachers in Chicago, Ravitch (who worked in both the George H. W. Bush and Clinton administrations and was originally a strong supporter of NCLB) declared: The new capitalist-driven school reforms principally target teachers and their unions for a reason: teachers, as a rule (although often politically passive), strongly object to both the new corporate schooling being imposed on their students and the Taylorization of their own labor process. Teachers generally view themselves as educational professionals, but are today being rapidly proletarianized. Hence, they are the most powerful potential opposition to the school restructuring plan and the commodification of school children. For this reason, the new testing systems are aimed first and foremost at teachers. They are intended to be assessments, not primarily of the students themselves, but of the degree to which teachers have succumbed to Taylorization—and thus they constitute the main weapon in the attempt to wrest control of the practice of education from teachers. Duncan has on several occasions proclaimed that one of the main achievements of Race to the Top has been forcing states to abandon restrictions on using student-assessment tests to evaluate teachers.83 As Ravitch observed in The Death and Life of the Great American School System: In this rapidly decaying situation, the attack on teachers and the destruction of their morale can be seen as fatal to the public education system, since teachers generally in capitalist society have sought to promote education (not mere schooling), out of a commitment to children, often in defiance of an alienated system. Teachers have adopted counter-hegemonic practices and upheld by sheer force of commitment, a collapsing school system that, without their often extraordinary efforts would surely have given way. Most teachers surveyed by the National Education Association in its most recent Status of the American Public School Teacher work at least ten non-compensated hours (beyond the standard 40-hour-work week) each week, and supplement classroom budgets/resources with their own purchases, averaging $443 a year.86 Without the strong social commitment of teachers, the overstrained public education system would surely have succumbed to its own contradictions long ago. Most teachers, over the last few decades, have gotten used to being on the frontlines in dealing with the effects of economic crisis and class-race war on schoolchildren. The creation of a program of national assessment, aimed principally at teachers and teachers’ unions, with the goal of privatizing the education system and turning the mass of students into drones for industry has brought public education into the very center of the structural crisis of the system. Many teachers have been fired, while others have fled the dying public schools.  In the past few decades, the response of the nation’s overworked teachers to “the ravages of society” and the accompanying attacks on schools has usually been to use what energy they had on helping their students, while avoiding organized political activity. But this may be changing. Today political resistance around schools from teachers, parents, students, and community members seems to be emerging at long last in the United States—though it is too soon to know what this portends. The strategic goal of a resistance movement to public school privatization should not simply be to defend the existing school system—but to make use of this state of emergency to create the basis of a truly revolutionary approach to the education process, based in community schools. This could take place under the motto promoted by the James and Grace Lee Boggs Center in Detroit: Another Education is Possible. As Grace Lee Boggs has written, we need to engage our children in the community-building process, including education, “with the same audacity with which the civil rights movement engaged them in desegregation activities.” Radical education theorist Bill Ayers has called for rebuilding the model of “liberatory education” and freedom schools in defiance of No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top, rearticulating “the ideal that each human being is of infinite value.” This means emphasizing, as radical educators historically have, a process of self-engaged learning—recognizing, in line with Marx and Paulo Freire, that the answer to the question, “Who educates the educator?” is ultimately one of liberation pedagogy, in which the students themselves are the main protagonists.93 The stakes are extremely high. In his article, “Why Socialism?” published in the first issue of Monthly Review, in May 1949, Albert Einstein wrote: I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are organized by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.95 I believe we must prepare ourselves today for a for a long revolution to create, among other things, a new education tied to community, and developing out of peoples’ real needs. Such a “community-centered and person-based” education, situated first in public schools, but extending into the society as a whole, is best achieved by creating the widest possible respect for education, as constituting, at one and the same time, a way of life, a key to human emancipation, and an indispensable basis for the creation of a world of substantive equality.
There is one last feature of Nietzsche’s theoretical speculations on giftgiving warranting some attention. gift-giving risks undermining the masks that are necessary for our protection In giving a gift one undertakes the hermeneutical project of discovering what is appropriate to the true character of the recipient. If I fail to interpret him properly, he will feel that some violence or degradation has been done. . . . 36 Nietzsche’s philosophy of masks is of considerable importance, particularly when comparing the congruence between what the intervener gives and what the recipient wants or needs. if I fail to recognize, connect with, and respond to the individual on this most fundamental of levels, the receiver of the assistance is certain to feel that an injustice has occurred.

it is thermal coal in electricity production that has been the powerhouse of the Chinese coal market.¶ The IEA estimates that in 2008 coal accounted for almost 80% of Chinese electricity production. While growth rates in renewable energies are high, they are starting from a very low base. According to the IEA, China will add an additional 600GW of new coal-fired power generation by 2035, this exceeds the current coal capacity of the USA, EU and Japan combined.

Ever since Tsai Ing-wen was elected president of Taiwan in 2016, Beijing has signaled its displeasure with her stand-alone attitude. China has been stepping up its campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally, while its military flexes its muscles. Outright conflict, for now, remains unlikely, but the narrow Taiwan Strait is reemerging as one of Asia’s most dangerous potential flash points, experts say. Last month, Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act into law, after unanimous votes in both houses of Congress. Recognizing Taiwan as a “beacon of democracy in Asia,” the act declares that it should be U.S. policy to send officials at all levels to Taiwan and allow high-level Taiwanese officials to visit their counterparts in Washington. “Because such declarations reflect the agreement of both houses of Congress and the president, it is hardly surprising that, as the Iraq and Cuba examples should remind us, such statutory declarations of policy often prevail as actual U.S. foreign policy,” he wrote. “We can and should expect the Taiwan Travel Act to shape U.S. Taiwan policy in the near and long term.” After Trump signed the act, China’s government lodged “stern” objections, warning Washington of potentially serious damage to the foundations of their relationship.  Either of those moves would be seen in Beijing as firmly crossing a line. “Taiwan needs the United States’ strong support, but it should be wary that this not tip toward belligerence,” said Margaret Lewis, a professor at Seton Hall Law School currently working in Taiwan. “Especially with so many global flash points that could quickly divert the U.S. government’s attention, a concern is that the U.S. might take an outspoken stance on Taiwan and then suddenly soften its tone, which could leave Taiwan in an even more vulnerable position,” she said.
Congress needs to simplify the process of oversight. Overlapping jurisdiction sows confusion in the executive branch DHS officials will spend excessive time testifying in front of multiple committees with oversight and jurisdictional responsibilities. DHS officials have been pulled in different directions Overlapping jurisdiction saps time that DHS officials need to do the important work of implementing DHS’s goals The primary difficulty of protecting the homeland is setting priorities. There are an infinite number of targets, a wide array of terrorist methods, and a seemingly endless list of areas and entities that demand resources Multiple committees with jurisdiction and oversight are likely to have different – even conflicting – priorities for DHS agencies This will complicate an already complicated task homeland security demands a streamlined budgeting process homeland security is a long-term issue; homeland security demands that government navigate a complex maze of policy choices in the most efficient manner possible.
Comprehensive approaches are urgently needed to make school environments welcoming for LGBT students and staff, and to allow students to learn and socialize with peers without fearing exclusion, humiliation, or violence. States should repeal outdated and stigmatizing laws that deter and arguably prohibit discussion of LGBT issues in schools, Schools should ensure that policies, curricula include LGBT people

legal thought folds in on itself we seem to be on the other side of an inversion both the thought and the thinker serve as occasions and vehicles for the prosecution and adjudication of rightness disputes Combined with a furious focus on productivity and ferocious self-promotion the rightness orientation leads legal thought to fold in on itself perhaps most easily exemplified in the rankings mania Once it was thought that the rankings were reflective of excellence But now rankings mania has folded in on itself. What matters now is but the logic of self-reference. The whole point of rankings is to rank the whole point of publishing is to publish. There is no significant external end. Not long ago, this was the outre claim of a French philosopher Today, it’s just a banal observation legal thought is what it is this phrase implies resignation as in " there's not much to be done about it." But the phrase also implies a certain mature reflection as in, and so better to focus your energies elsewhere Be intellectually serious Drop the received scholarly agendas Forget reflective equilibrium Ditch the ideal observer Throw your copy of The Concept of Law" into a lake and give "Law's Empire" to a homeless person stop worrying about helping the courts with their various legitimation needs They don't need you. Really. They'll be just fine Instead, try to find the best description you can of whatever might be called the postmodern condition Maybe Postman or Zengotita or Baudrillard or Lyotard, or whoever It doesn't really matter what matters is that you find some salient description of our contemporary intellectual-cultural condition that seems credible and convincing Let the condition become your mind and try to think about law from within that condition Think normatively if you want - but do it from within that condition leave the academic formalizations behind . If necessary, leave the room . If you tinker anyway, don't call it philosophy. If you do call your tinkering philosophy, try not to publish it. Try to think from within the as yet undertheorized here and Realize that there is no glory, no virtue, and no challenge in theorizing from the exceedingly well-rehearsed formal frames of jurisprudence and legal philosophy. It's been done And we do not have a lot to show for it. rethink law from a position that is at least plausibly our own Maybe it'll work for you and maybe it won't. If it does work for you, it's as close as you are likely to come to doing serious philosophy Failing that retrieve the soggy book you threw into the lake.

there are very good reasons to stop spending billions of dollars on manned space missions, to explore space in ways that are safer and much less costly, and to grant much higher priority to the oceans The main costs of space exploration arise from the fact that we are set on sending humans the case for manned flights gets weaker and weaker with every advance in robotics and miniaturization Ninety percent of the ocean floor has not even been charted The oceans play a major role in controlling our climate. Ocean organisms are said to hold the promise of cures for an array of diseases.
If every action that we carry out yields more utility than any other action available to us, then the total utility of all our actions will be the highest possible level of utility that we could bring about we can maximize the overall utility that is within our power to bring about by maximizing the utility of each individual action that we perform If we sometimes choose actions that produce less utility than is possible, the total utility of our actions will be less than the amount of goodness that we could have produced we should apply the utilitarian principle to individual acts and not to classes of similar actions. Traditional moral codes consist of sets of rules regarding types of actions The Ten Commandments, for example They tell us “thou shalt not do x” rather than saying “thou shalt not do x except in circumstances a, b, or c.” both customary and philosophical moral codes consist of absolute rules Kant is famous for the view that lying is always wrong, even in cases where one might save a life by lying if A is trying to murder B and A asks you where B is, it would be wrong for you to lie to A, even if lying would save B’s life (Kant). Act utilitarian’s reject rigid rule-based moralities that identify whole classes of actions as right or wrong. it is a mistake to treat whole classes of actions as right or wrong because the effects of actions differ when they are done in different contexts and morality must focus on the likely effects of individual actions It is these effects that determine whether they are right or wrong in specific cases Act utilitarians acknowledge that it may be useful to have moral rules that are “rules of thumb but insist that whenever people can do more good by violating a rule rather than obeying it, they should violate the rule They see no reason to obey a rule when more well-being can be achieved by violating it Why Act Utilitarianism Makes Moral Judgments Objectively True One advantage of utilitarianism is that it shows how moral questions can have objectively true answers people believe that morality is subjective and depends only on people’s desires or sincere beliefs utilitarianism, however, provides a method for showing which moral beliefs are true and which are false Once we embrace the utilitarian perspective every decision about how we should act will depend on the actual or foreseeable consequences of the available options If we can predict the amount of utility/good results that will be produced by various possible actions, then we can know which ones are right or wrong some people doubt that we can measure amounts of well-being we do this all the time If two people are suffering and we have enough medication for only one, we can often tell that one person is experiencing mild discomfort while the other is in severe pain we will be confident that we can do more good by giving the medication to the person suffering extreme pain we can have objectively true answers to questions about what actions are morally right or wrong. Jeremy Bentham provided a model for this type of decision making in his description of a “hedonic calculus,” which was meant to show what factors should be used to determine amounts of pleasure and happiness, pain and suffering. Using this information, Bentham thought, would allow for making correct judgments both in individual cases and in choices about government actions and policies.
The question I want to raise about this is whether it might be motivated and thereby explained by the spirit of ressentiment? First, an inability to ‘let go’, to forget, it cannot have done with anything It is both a backward-looking spirit—it needs to keep on remembering past injustices—and an expansive spirit—it needs to find new injustices everywhere. In the kinds of institutions, I am concerned with, those in which women have roughly achieved equal power, it can be expressed in the following kind of phenomenon. Where those with institutional power cannot justifiably claim that they are being discriminated against at the level of actions and practices they can maintain their political integrity, their claim to ideological purity and sense of powerlessness by resorting to finding ‘evil’ and injustice in wider and wider circumstances and at deeper and more concealed levels. The issue is no longer just what men say about and do to women but the very nature of language, discourse, culture and society. The person motivated by the spirit of ressentiment looks for ‘evil’, needs to recriminate and distribute blame, to impute wrongs, distribute responsibilities and to find sinners. As Nietzsche says, they want others to be evil in order to be able to consider themselves good There seems to be two elements here. One is the need to see the other as powerful and responsible for my powerlessness, and then the transformation of this thought into the thought that my powerlessness is a proof of my goodness and the other’s evil. And this works by a revaluation of the enemy’s values— an act of the most spiritual revenge This makes sense of two aspects of feminist thought. First, the need to see women as helpless victims, as abused, misrepresented, as powerless in the face of such an onslaught of sexist, patriarchal, male power in every dimension of life and thought. Second, in the now frequently asserted claims of women’s moral superiority: that women are caring, nurturant, their relations non-hierarchical, and so on. And seeing ourselves as good gives us a right to demand that others conform to our values. One further aspect of ressentiment worth mentioning here is the inability to admire and respect. In contrast with envy, which allows for the possibility of admiring the work and qualities of those we envy, ressentiment allows for no such thing. If a man gets a job or promotion or a publication it is explained away by the fact that he is a man, using old boys’ networks and so on. And now that women are getting jobs and so on we can see the same type of response on the part of men: she got it only because of affirmative action policies or because of her sexual behaviour. , in the discussion of ressentiment I do not mean to be attributing particular psychological states to particular individuals, but rather to be diagnosing the spirit of some current feminist discursive and non-discursive practices. My concern is not with ressentiment as individual psychology but with the way this is played out politically. Women have quite reasonably wanted power, but perhaps, entangled in the spirit of ressentiment we have failed to be sufficiently critical about what it was that we wanted in wanting power. We wanted what it was that we believed the others had: power over.
The debate about immigration is often emotional Shifting focus away from a debate based on merits of policy options, some advocating higher levels of immigration and amnesty have resorted to attacking and impugning the motives of their opponents.
of Bataille's mystical subversion Bataille's position with respect to the violence of the war could only be enacted/communicated performatively not a set of ethical propositions or rationally coordinated political theses, but rather a style of life that, considered as a (lacerated but living) whole, offered an alternative to the values and forms of existence that had found their culmination in totalitarian oppression and war. The life of mysticism and expenditure could not be adequately described in the language of philosophical, social scientific, or political discourse. Bataille affirmed: "what counts is the moment of ungluing What I teach is an intoxication, not a philosophy. I am not a philosopher, but a saint, maybe a madman the meditational method and mystical style of existence opened the route to a concrete experience of the heterogeneity and sovereignty of the self and thus laid the groundwork for genuine freedom. The inner experience of freedom remains the precondition of any meaningful deployment of freedom in the public, political world. mystical writing initiates autonomy by showing people that they carry the supreme law within themselves, by teaching them to experience themselves as their own law (a law constituted through endless contestation The "naked" sovereign of inner experience, "knowing that  [the self] will die" finds freedom tempered with the awareness of radical vulnerability and contingency, thus making freedom inseparable from "compassion" from a tragic "loyalty" Without the sacrificial knowledge of its own penetration by death, the self's exercise of freedom would inevitably become an "exercise of power" over others Instead, inner experience is a sacrificial "conquest" of the self "for others" Sovereignty is not static governance but tireless "revolt" Bataille's textual mysticism undermines or overflows the conceptual structures on which the logic of domination relies. It attacks utility, rationality, hierarchical order, and identity. By affirming a useless inner experience as in itself "sole authority, sole value" mysticism challenges the right of coercive political systems to claim ultimate value and unlimited authority for themselves. By introducing — through "auto-sacrificial" writing — the toxin of the impossible into calculations of human meaning, Bataille sought to reach the "underside" of language and human experience, to uncover the "nakedness" of irreducible anguish that philosophy and political theory had sought to conceal, and to "annul the effects of totalizing discourse," both in the philosophical and in the political realms as mystic one speaks of death from within death death's impossible and necessary truth belongs to the sacrifice" who raise up death's "bloody but wholly resplendent image" in the midst of a "sacred silence" in war or peace human life only begins to deploy its richness when death is internalized and when life can be affirmed and loved in and through death the mystic embodies this affirmation By writing his own mystical dissolution, Bataille shows how it is possible to "watch [one]self ceasing to be" What arises in the experience  is  a better way of encountering death's power reality and obviousness which are obscene. It is the truth we should laugh at A certain form of thought is bound to the real. It starts out from the hypothesis that ideas have referents and that there is a possible ideation of reality. A comforting polarity, which is that of tailor-made dialectical and philosophical solutions. The other form of thought is illusion, power of illusion, or, in other words, a playing with reality seduction playing with desire playing with truth. This radical thought is the material illusion the extrapolation of this world into another world. At all events, there is incompatibility between thought and the real. This is what ensures the singularity of thought which constitutes an event
Mexico is an afterthought our attention and resources are diverted to the Middle East or to grand strategies based on ‘pivoting’ our geopolitical and economical capacity towards Asia. . This is unfortunate, because our neighbor to the south has quietly positioned itself to be the next jewel in the emerging markets portfolio. In essence immigration and the drug trade will no longer anchor the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico; instead, economics, finance, trade, and commerce will dictate the terms between the neighboring countries.
Brown is pressing lawmakers to extend California's cap-and-trade legislation . The governor touts the program around the world as an effective way to affordably address climate change, but its legal authorization expires in 2020 The current proposal would expand the program until 2030.
In exercising his authority to export controls, the President is directed to establish and maintain lists of items subject to control, It expands the definition of dual-use items to include those that could be used for cyber or terrorist attacks. The legislation establishes penalties consistent with the IEEPA penalties This committee is also charged with regularly reviewing the control list and establishing and maintaining a licensing system The legislation requires the President to maintain current license requirements on countries supporting international terrorism
DOE EPSCoR enhances the capability of states to conduct sustainable and nationally competitive energy-related research increase the number of competitive scientists and engineers in energy-related areas, and build beneficial relationships between designated states and laboratories managed by DOE The DOE EPSCoR effort to develop science and engineering research infrastructure and human resources enables the states to contribute to the current and future energy-related needs
regarding public discourse on cyberattack is analogous to the nuclear debate of 50 years ago nuclear policy issues were veiled in secrecy, and there was little public debate seminal pieces did much to raise the public profile of these issues and stimulated an enormous amount of subsequent work outside government that has had a real impact on nuclear policy From our perspective as the co-chairs of this study, the topic of cyberattack is so important across a multitude of national interests—not just defense or even just national security—that it deserves robust and open discussion and debate for such discussion and debate to be productive, they must be based on some common foundation of information about the topic at hand.  the report’s role in providing education and background is in our view its most important function.
spills exact a serious toll on coastal economies, including our approximately $35 billion commercial fishing The damage and clean up costs following the Exxon Valdez spill were so extensive that Exxon paid out more than one billion dollars to the federal and state governments for damages and clean up costs—and still owes fishermen a July 2008 accident between a chemical tanker and an oil barge discharged more than 270,000 gallons of fuel oil, closing a huge swath of the Lower Mississippi River to vessel traffic for several days. The Port of New Orleans, located at the center of the world’s busiest port complex, was shut down and residents were asked to conserve water when water intakes were closed to prevent contamination of drinking water.
Fukushima permanent reminder of unacceptable risks posed by nuclear plants Even routine radioactive releases from nuclear power plants can prove fatal A technology that has the capacity to poison resources cannot be endorsed
Mexico has failed to meet the four human rights requirements set out by law. Congress should not release these select Merida funds. Releasing these funds would send the message that the United States condones the grave human rights violations committed in Mexico, including torture, rape, killings, and enforced disappearances. the United States can play a constructive role in strengthening Mexico’s ability to confront organized crime However, human rights violations committed by Mexican forces are not only deplorable but also undermine Mexico’s public security Building trust between the Mexican people and the government is essential to gathering information to dismantle organized crime. When security forces commit grave human rights violations and they are not held accountable for their actions, they lose that trust, alienating key allies and leaving civilians in a state of terror and defenselessness
The defence against critiques that attempt to recover the violent history of liberalism is that ‘it is a mistake to throw out the language of equal worth and self-determination because of its contingent association with the historical configurations of Western power’ Yet historically speaking the emergence of the modern European state system was ‘coterminous with, and indissociable from, the genocide of the indigenous peoples of the “new” world, the enslavement of the natives of the African continent, and the colonisation of the societies of Asia’ While the urge to imperialism is inherent in liberalism but not a necessary outcome Western liberalism has a bloody history liberalism’s ‘others’ are excluded from liberal norms because the definition of otherness ‘is prior ’ to theories of politics and the international Held asks us not to dismiss liberalism because it contains the promise that one day, via some of the very actors that are implicated in the emergence of this state of affairs, the world’s problems will be solved or at least mitigated. The effect of this is to enact the ‘eternal deferment of the possibility of overcoming the alienation of international society that commenced in 1492’, which serves to justify contemporary and historical violence and inequality because ‘the present is inscribed as a transitional phase whose violent and unequal character is expiated on the altar of that which is to come’ Liberal accounts of globalisation, global civil society and progressive change thus serve to entrench and perpetuate some of the very practices they claim to oppose Liberalism’s self-image as tolerant, inclusive and non-violent does not match up to its historical expression
Fidel Castro has taken an American overture or challenge and, using a Fidelista jujitsu, turned it to his own advantage. In the process, countless families like mine have been whipsawed between hope and despair Efforts to democratize Cuba left freedoms further restricted. Presidents came and went, but the constants were disappointment, and Fidel half-century has been a roller coaster for Cuba and the United States. Dwight Eisenhower was quick to recognize Mr. Castro’s government, and quick to slam shut the diplomatic door. John Kennedy got stung at the Bay of Pigs. Lyndon Johnson was uninterested in negotiating with Castro; so was Richard Nixon until his opening to China made him and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, think they could do something similar with Cuba. Mr. Kissinger tried, and continued under President Ford, but got nowhere. Robert A. Pastor, President Carter’s national security adviser for Latin America, warned Mr. Castro that entering Ethiopia would end further normalization. Mr. Castro sent troops anyway. As relations deteriorated, he accused Washington of reneging on immigration promises, and threw open the port of Mariel along with prisons, hospitals and insane asylums. More than 120,000 refugees landed on Florida’s shores, backing the United States into taking them all. President-elect Barack Obama’s promises to move toward normalization if Cuba democratizes probably won’t work, because Mr. Castro has never accepted that equation. “We long ago overestimated how important normalization and lifting the embargo were for Castro, and we’re still doing it,” he said. The threat, real or invented, of United States attacks has been a central element of Mr. Castro’s revolutionary identity, and the embargo his call to arms
Native American languages were mainly dead or dying. By the late 20th Century, more than half the Native Americans in the U.S. were living in urban areas, where English was their everyday and home language. The few remaining Native American languages still in use were increasingly spoken only by the elders. But there has been a resilience among the first people of North America in the 21st Century, and many of them have been determined to hang on to their heritage Others are looking for ways to revitalize traditional cultures, spiritual values–and languages Why should we care about preserving languages? Whether for heritage or scientific reasons, languages need to be recorded. Every language is useful as a means to identify a group. It codifies the history and world view of a people. It’s clear that it’s important to many people that they have their language that identifies them uniquely as a group. Most native communities in the U.S. want to have as good and accurate record of their language as possible, in a format to be enjoyed by as many people as possible. There is great interest in documenting this heritage. Documenting a disappearing language is so important, but it’s possible only to really begin to appreciate all the subtleties and complexities of language if you have some speakers left to give you the dynamics and social context. If a language goes then it can’t find new life without recorded materials. “Every language furthers and refines our understanding of cognition, communications systems, the nature of the mind and the different ways people categorize our collective human experience.” From a scientific perspective it is also imperative to document languages while they are still alive. Languages are markers of identity and group cohesion. Linguists will tell you that every language furthers and refines our understanding of cognition, communications systems, the nature of the mind and the different ways people categorize our collective human experience. For scientists, who knows what benefits there will be down the line that we don’t even know about now yet. Certainly there will be uses for the data. But you can be sure it won’t be used if it’s not documented At the time Lewis and Clark arrived in what’s now Oregon 200 years ago there were 14 language families, more than in all of Europe combined. Today only five families of languages exist, and most of them have only a handful of speakers. The vast majority of the remaining languages in Oregon are known only by very few elders. The language diversity of that region has fallen off a cliff. There has been some documentation of these languages, but mostly just as text, and often a hundred years old. The complexity of the setting of these texts, and the sounds of the languages have often been lost. With the loss of the languages, all kinds of wonderful things that the speakers did with their languages have also vanished, for example, some of the greatest works of oral literature ever produced–the multilingual performances with different characters speaking different languages that was found in the Pacific Northwest. The loss of any language is a loss for us all. We lose part of the human genius, and with the disappearance of a language also goes a lot of spiritual concepts, art, and so on.” The loss of any language is a loss for us all. We lose part of the human genius, and with the disappearance of a language also goes a lot of spiritual concepts, art, and so on. There is also the concept that you don’t have to be tied to one language, or worse, be forced to learn one over another.
skeptics rush to proclaim climate change " may save us from the next ice age Channell explains we have added CO2 cooling forces can't keep up. skeptic claim is an odd argument it is a tacit admission that man-made climate change is happening skeptics were claiming a 'mini ice age' beg the question of why they aren't worried about climate disruption occurring much sooner skeptics miss the point Skinner of Earth Sciences at Cambridge points out that 'preserving' our climate by releasing greenhouse gases is flawed The rate of CO2 is unprecedented there are huge consequences you can't have it both ways If human greenhouse gas emissions are capable of preventing shifts in 1,500 years time they're capable of causing disruptive climate shifts well before then
The Obama administration relies on drones for one simple reason: they work since Obama has been in the White House, U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,300 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban—top figures who are not easily replaced when experienced leaders are eliminated, the result is “the rise of lower leaders who are not as experienced as the former leaders” and who are prone to errors and miscalculations drones also hurt terrorist organizations when they eliminate operatives who are lower down on the food chain but who boast special skills: passport forgers, bomb makers, recruiters, and fundraisers. Drones undercut terrorists’ ability to communicate and to train new recruits. Leaders cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire group of new recruits Drones have turned al Qaeda’s command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders Critics of drone strikes often fail to take into account the fact that the alternatives are either too risky or unrealistic.
House passes Freedom Act despite withdrawn industry support many groups have withdrawn their support after it was "watered down the Senate's hands, according to congressional sources will aim to counter some of the lobbying effort by the Obama administration by strengthening previously removed provisions. the wider technology industry and privacy groups took a stronger stance in recent days by pulling their support for the bill. What is being considered is not the bill that was marked up Certain key elements of this bill were changed One of the changes that riled Silicon Valley giants and privacy groups alike was the broad definition of database searching. It's now dangerously broad and vague." a coalition of the U.S.' largest technology companies, including Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Facebook, warned that certain definitions in the bill would create an "unacceptable loophole" that could enable the bulk collection of internet users' data The coalition said it would not support the Freedom Act as it currently stands. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said it was "dismayed" by the "gutted" bill The new version not only adds the undefined words ' but makes the list of potential selection terms open-ended The bill now goes against the overwhelming support for definitively ending bulk collection The bill provides no protection for non-US persons and the provisions designed to protect U.S. persons have been extensively watered down The bill will now move to the Senate, where sources suggest it will be pulled apart and initial provisions designed to restore trust in the U.S. intelligence community will be rewritten and added
None of which is to suggest that adopting the model would be unproblematic. past struggles by marginalized communities have been piecemeal and fragmented. attempts at endogenous development are likely to flounder without external stimulus and help, perhaps particularly from the state. Such opposition is indeed likely to be triggered by attempts to practice IM, since the model is fundamentally incompatible with and often overtly antipathetic to capitalist dynamics Expecting the ideal model to develop by 'stealth' in this context could itself be Utopian.
I would like to see more exploration and research to make sure we know what’s there and what the challenges are of going after it I don’t think we know if we’ll have the resources to meet future demand recycling e-waste cannot satisfy the rapidly growing demand for rare earth metals, it is one way to help alleviate the shortage Recycling and reusing materials also saves the energy used in mining and processing, conserves resources, and reduces pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. only 25 percent was recycled
The NAFTA panel issued a remarkable ruling indicating that all adverse domestic court decisions are potentially eligible for NAFTA review as international law violations Remarkably, the panel failed to place any limits on the type of domestic court decision that can be challenged using the investor-state mechanism, Thus, it is no surprise that the Loewen tribunal decision was greeted with great concern in U.S. legal circles The Conference of Chief Justices promptly passed a resolution calling upon the Bush administration to keep court rulings out of trade tribunals
the major challenges for the U.S.-China relationship will come in working together to address critical global challenges such as nuclear proliferation, energy and food security, terrorism, climate change, Middle East instability, cyber security, and global financial reform and recovery. Many in Washington are concerned that the new model of great power relations concept is an effort by China to compel the U.S. to respect China’s core interests, create Chinese spheres of influence, and get the U.S. to accommodate China's interests on Beijing’s terms. This type of approach will not work our countries have new areas of tensions in the relationship that exacerbate mistrust these issues included revelations of Chinese cyber hacking of American commercial and military secrets to dangerous risks deriving from regional territorial disputes in the South and East China Sea, including Beijing’s recent announcement of a new Air Defense Identification Zone. we must address them with urgency and find ways to reduce these disagreements and enhance trust if we are to achieve a new type of major country relations.
And all governments in the region want to cooperate with China Beijing also seeks to avoid choosing sides between the region’s rivals but cooperate with them all, China offers one significant advantage over Russia: China buys oil from the region while Russia competes with the countries there in selling it. And with its much larger economy, China’s influence in the region could well dwarf Russia’s if and when Beijing chooses to exercise it considering Russia’s own economic dependence on China
Bringing a new drug to market now requires 12 to 15 years and costs more than $1.4 billion, and the number of drugs approved by the FDA annually is trending downward in spite of years of significant increases in the agency's budget Another metric that reflects what the drug companies are experiencing is the plummeting success rate of Phase 2 clinical trials, in which the efficacy of a new drug candidate begins to be assessed; from 28 percent in 2006-2007, it fell to 18 percent in 2008-2010, Facing regulatory uncertainty or obstructionism, companies are simply abandoning projects that in a more positive regulatory environment might have yielded medically useful, profitable products This lowers the probability that an American research-intensive company will come up with The Next Big Thing, for either its initial indication or subsequent ones Is it any surprise that potential investors are disenchanted? The current sorry state of pharmaceutical development reflects the FDA's excessive risk aversion, unchecked by congressional oversight, which has forced companies to perform ever-larger, longer, more complex, and more expensive clinical trials regulators have concocted additional criteria for granting marketing approval of a drug. The new criteria are above and beyond the statutory requirement for the demonstration of safety and efficacy and could inflict significant damage on both patients and pharmaceutical companies For example, although the law requires that to be marketed a drug must simply be shown to be safe and effective, the agency denied approval of Merck's Arcoxia, a COX-2 enzyme inhibitor for the relief of arthritis pain, because the drug needed to be shown to be superior to existing drugs. and it epitomizes the flawed, anti-innovation decision-making that prevails at FDA and other regulatory agencies For several reasons, it may be important to have “another drug on the market" even if it appears from clinical trials data to be no better than the alternatives. First, there are often critical differences between drugs that act through similar mechanisms , companies are not starting out to develop a me-too product any more than a marathon runner starts a race intending to be an also-ran Regulatory excesses harm more than just industries and individual companies. The diversion of resources to comply with regulation (useful or not) exerts an “income effect” that shows a correlation between wealth and health Wealthier individuals are able to purchase better healthcare, enjoy more nutritious diets, and lead generally less stressful lives. Conversely, the deprivation of income itself has adverse health effects The excess costs in the tens of billions of dollars required annually by excessively precautionary regulation for various classes of consumer products would, therefore, be expected to cause thousands of deaths per year. The expression “regulatory overkill” is not merely a figure of speech. Not only have we experienced several years of slow economic growth and job creation but for the third year in a row, the United States has slipped in the World Economic Forum's (WEF) annual competitiveness survey Obama has too often advanced policies that inhibit innovation, discourage R&D, blunt wealth creation, and kill jobs
expected doubling of populations by 2035 would cause dramatic delays at the border bridges resulting in a threat to business instead of providing larger markets. continuous population growth will cause wait times on international bridges to increase from two hours to almost four extended wait times will provoke a negative effect Businesses in the area have [already] been affected, but neither the government nor the people have realized the threat international ports of entry would reach their maximum operational capacity by 2035. Some of the effects will be the loss of more than $54 billion and 850,000 jobs along both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, primarily related to the import-export of goods. Competitiveness would also be affected. “We need to consider this as an increasing partnership,” This ongoing problem started 30 years ago Congress have not evaluated the importance of this problem to the import and export of goods with Mexico, as well as billions worth of revenue to the U S
Since 9/11 foreign policy focus of the U S has been directed away from regional concerns towards problems outside the Western Hemisphere What of U.S. – Mexican relations? now is the time to deal with the significant and pressing problems that occupy U.S. foreign relations with Mexico public views in both countries are converging in the realms of terrorism, drug trafficking, and immigration, the moment is ripe to deal with these issues failure to engage Mexico immediately will prevent the resolution of pressing issues while engendering anger and continued frustration because the United States continues to ignore the maintenance of an important international relationship views in both countries converge around the issues of immigration, terrorism, and drug trafficking People in both the United States and Mexico are optimistic that the issues of immigration, terrorism, and drug trafficking can be solved if proper attention is focused on solutions and international coordination mobilizing this mutual support will be critical to resolving these outstanding foreign policy problems terrorism U.S. foreign policy should equally look in its own backyard for solutions to security problems Since both publics view the issue as critical, it seems prudent that both states work together towards intelligence sharing and stable borders
Overfishing damages other species of fish and disrupts local ecosystems. The stability of ecological communities depends largely on the interactions between predators and prey the balance of the food chain is disturbed when certain species are removed. As a result, many ocean species are disappearing and losing their habitats. As predators diminish, the populations of smaller fish escalate because they were previously the food source of the bigger fish overfishing is also decreasing the genetic diversity of fish worldwide Diversity is projected to be reduced further if overfishing continues at the same rate This has serious effects on nutrient recycling in marine ecosystems because fish species vary widely in their rates of nitrogen and phosphorus excretion
the most common argument to appear is that the Earth is not warming This, too, is false, as evident by measurements reported in numerous articles The foundation for many of the claims that the Earth has ceased or even slowed its warming is based on a selective assessment of small portions of the Earth system rather than the Earth as a whole With the advancement of satellite measuring methodologies, it became possible to achieve near global coverage using microwave radiometers. With continuous and long-term records, it was possible to make longitudinal studies of the rate of temperature change in the troposphere and the stratosphere Among the early findings was the surprising conclusion that the lower atmosphere of the Earth was cooling, in direct contradiction to the consensus AGW view.¶ many questions raised regarding errors associated with merging satellite records, orbital decay of satellites as their altitude decreased over time, errors of on-board temperature calibration measurement systems, and drift in the time of observation and thus aliasing of the diurnal cycle as corrections were made the original conclusions of a cooling troposphere were modified to show warming. the critiques of the satellite records continued solar heating of the instruments or changes to instrumentation introduced errors in the measured temperatures One other source of error is the bias associated with the measurement instruments themselves on board the satellites The result of this two-decade investigation is that the previously reported cooling of the atmosphere was based on faulty technique and equipment All data now shows that the lower atmosphere is heating This is a strong indicator that the temperature increases of the Earth’s surface over the past 40 years is caused by greenhouse gas emissions (rather than by other causes such as increased solar activity
Weather disruptions at home and weak demand abroad caused a contraction of rare severity in the U.S. economy in the first quarter, renewing doubts about the strength of the nation's five-year-old recovery. The U.S. economy in the first quarter saw its sharpest pullback since the recession ended nearly five years ago. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, fell at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.9% in the first quarter, the fastest rate of decline since the recession, and was the largest drop recorded since the end of World War II But the severity of the drop, he said, "calls into question how much vigor there is in the pace of activity" going forward. One factor in the government's revision of first-quarter output was difficulty in estimating the impact of the Affordable Care Act on health-care expenditures. But five years into the recovery, high unemployment and stagnant incomes continue to restrain the American consumer.
Conventional policy studies represent the master's tool in that they are primarily a mechanism for powerholders to find cost effective ways to pursue their goals ). To discern the master's tools we need to deconstruct the concepts, problems, subjects and interpretations that formulate policy studies. For even though gender may appear to be absent or irrelevant, ultimately the decisions that emerge from such studies do have gendered consequences. As has been pointed out, 'the notion of androcentrism suggests that assumptions, concepts, beliefs, arguments, theories, methods, laws, policies and institutions may all be "gendered"'
In recent years the U S constitutional reasoning and practice has been going global. trend became apparent , in the course of its analysis in the recent affirmative action and gay rights cases, the U.S. Supreme Court made frank references to foreign practices Court's transnational references in these cases were notable in cases involving domestic policy issues were unusually prominent. they represent a calculated step by key justices on the Court these efforts in the American judiciary are taking place both in the United States and around the world, are coming to understand legal transnationalism as an imperative
how inclusive education reform is appropriated in schools where New Capitalism work practices dominate the discourse of school improvement. We seek to understand the interplay between New Capitalism work practices, inclusive education, and professional practices of teachers and administrators. We argue that agendas to design inclusive, supportive learning environments that promote broad and multiple forms of diversity compete and collide with reforms based on a neoliberal agenda (i.e., accountability, flexibility, and choice ew Capitalism can appropriate inclusive education as an ideological tool saturated with shallow sentiments that lead to little or no substantive improvements in educational access and outcomes for diverse and underserved students. Less attention has been paid to how New Capitalism work practices shape school professionals’ understanding and implementation of an inclusive education agenda, Inclusive education has been a global movement in response to the systemic exclusion of those considered different from the dominant culture of schools (e.g., racial, language, religious, and ethnic minorities, females, students with disabilities, and students from low-income backgrounds). Being different is highly consequential as it has historically been associated with deviance, deficit and exclusion while in the U.S. inclusive education has been defined as access to the general education curriculum for students with disabilities, within the international community it has had a broader equity agenda for all marginalized students definitions of inclusive education have ranged from assimilationist approaches to more transformative ones that aim to question, critique and change the normative parameters of the dominant culture of the schools In addition, conceptualizations of inclusive education have been criticized for their minimal attention to the complexities of intersecting forms of exclusion and the role of culture and geography in producing ever-changing margins and peripheries Exclusion emerges through the interaction of multiple factors The braid of ability, race/ethnicity, gender, language, and social class differences has been largely documented, and it has negatively affected students from ethnic and linguistic minorities These students tend to experience intersecting forms of exclusion Furthermore, in the U.S., students from ethnic and linguistic minorities receiving special education services are more likely to be placed in more segregated settings are more likely to be suspended from school and are less likely to enroll in a four-year college than White students receiving special education An inclusive education agenda that only focuses on one form of difference (e.g., being Latino or a student with disabilities) will not be able to fully to address the complex needs of students who embody multiple forms of difference
the US congress passed the Space Act of 2015 into law It goes against a number of treaties and international customary law which already apply to the entire universe. The act will also allow the private sector to make space innovations without regulatory oversight during an eight-year period and protect spaceflight participants from financial ruin . Space exploration is a universal activity and therefore requires international regulation. The act represents a full-frontal attack on settled principles of space law which are based on two basic principles: the right of states to scientific exploration of outer space and its celestial bodies and the prevention of unilateral and unbriddled commercial exploitation of outer-space resources These principles are found in agreements including the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and the Moon Agreement of 1979 there is no specific reference to international law in this statement. Simply relying on US legislation and policy statements to justify the plans is obviously insufficient , if we started contaminating celestial bodies with microbes from Earth, it could ruin our chances of ever finding alien life there. Mining minerals in space could also damage the environment around the Earth and eventually lead to conflict over resources Ultimately, the US plans must be understood in the light of existing rules of space law Companies may also be allowed to extract certain resources, but the very first provision of the Outer Space Treaty (1967), to which the US is a signatory, is that such exploration and use shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries. This therefore prevents the sale of space-based minerals for profit the Moon Agreement (1979) has in effect forbidden states to conduct commercial mining on planets and asteroids until there is an international regime for such exploitation it is binding as customary international law The idea that American companies can on the basis of domestic laws alone systematically exploit mineral resources in space, despite huge environmental risks, really amounts to the audacity of greed
there were questions about whether the U S would hold itself to the same high standards domestically that it holds others to internationally the American government has successfully built up a policy and programming agenda based on promoting an open Internet the legitimacy of these efforts has been thrown into question since the NSA disclosures began The American public, our nation’s allies, leading businesses and Internet users around the world are losing faith in the U.S. government’s role as the leading proponent of a free, open and integrated global Internet proposals for more governmental control over the network could be understood as attempts by authoritarian countries to more effectively monitor and censor their citizens which allowed the U.S. to reasonably maintain some moral high ground NSA surveillance would continue to be the focus of international convenings on Internet Freedom and Internet governance making civil society representatives and foreign governments far less willing to embrace the United States’ Internet Freedom agenda the NSA is galvanizing opposition to America’s internet freedom agenda The scandal revived proposals from both Russia and Brazil for global management of technical standards and domain names, NSA surveillance has shifted the dynamics of the Internet governance debate in a potentially destabilizing manner. in addition to revealing the scale and scope of state surveillance and the preeminent role of the United States and its partners, the NSA disclosures may push other states toward a more nationally partitioned Internet and “threaten… in a very fundamental way the claim that the US had a special status as neutral steward of Internet governance
Obama announced the creation of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling: an independent, nonpartisan entity, directed to provide a thorough analysis and impartial judgment. The President charged the Commission to determine the causes of the disaster, and to improve the country’s ability to respond to spills, and to recommend reforms to make offshore energy production safer. This report is the result of an intense six-month effort to fulfill the President’s charge. The Commission’s aim has been to provide the President,  policymakers, industry, and the American people a clear, accessible, accurate, and fair  account of the largest oil spill in U.S history: the context for the well itself, how the  explosion and spill happened, and how industry and government scrambled to respond  to an unprecedented emergency we conclude Deepwater energy exploration and production, particularly at the frontiers of experience, involve risks for which neither industry nor government has been adequately prepared, but for which they can and must be prepared in the future. To assure human safety and environmental protection, regulatory oversight of¶ leasing, energy exploration, and production require reforms even beyond those¶ significant reforms already initiated Fundamental  reform will be needed in both the structure of those in charge of regulatory oversight  and their internal decisionmaking process to ensure their political autonomy,  technical expertise, and their full consideration of environmental protection concerns ,  the oil and gas industry will need to take its own, unilateral steps to increase  dramatically safety throughout the industry, including self-policing mechanisms that  supplement governmental enforcement Scientific understanding of environmental conditions in sensitive environments in  deep Gulf waters, along the region’s coastal habitats, and in areas proposed for more  drilling, such as the Arctic, is inadequate.

ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) deportation officers administratively arrested 41,318 individuals Nearly 75 percent of those arrested during this period in 2017 are convicted criminals, with offenses ranging from homicide and assault to sexual abuse and drug-related charges. Violent crimes such as homicide, rape, kidnapping and assault accounted for more than 2,700 convictions. ICE’s immigration enforcement activity has resulted in the capture of egregious and violent offenders, such as: MS-13 gang member, Estivan Rafael Marques Velasquez Jose Mercedes Meza-Ignacio, 52, a citizen of Mexico residing in Atlanta, wanted on criminal charges for child molestation Juan Antonio Melchor Molina by the agency’s Dallas Fugitive Operations Team. Molina is the subject of a 2011 murder warrant issued by the Prosecutor General’s Office in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Mexican authorities allege that Molina shot and killed Jorge Alejandro De La Rosa Jose Victor Bonilla-Melendez, one of ICE’s “Most Wanted Fugitives,” in Denver, Colorado, following a public tip. Bonilla-Melendez is also known as Anthony Garcia-Melendez, a citizen of Honduras whose criminal history includes felony convictions for assault causing serious bodily injury, sexual assault and unlawful re-entry after deportation. The April 26 arrest in Houston, Texas, of William Magana-Contreras, a Salvadoran MS-13 gang member wanted for aggravated homicide in his home country.
The forthcoming US Nuclear Posture Review should broaden the traditional focus of such policy reviews on deterrence requirements it would be in the US national interest to adopt a no-first-use declaratory policy, stating clearly that ‘the role of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear weapons use by other nuclear weapons states against the United States, our allies, and our armed forces, and to be able respond, with an appropriate range of second-strike nuclear retaliation options, if necessary, in the event that deterrence fails’.
Waste disposal has become an issue of great environmental significance in China. China had become the dumping ground for the rest of the world China has a new "NIMBY-ism of the middle class The Chinese The article describes the difficult dilemma of whether to dispose of industrial pollutants into the Yangtze River or alternatively into the ocean, where local fishermen were bound to be affected Ample evidence suggests that China's proximate marine environments have suffered intensive degradation from dumping and over-fishing pollution was a significant reason that Bohai fish production is now just 20 percent of the level it was as recently as the 1980s The available data reveal similarly near catastrophic declines in the Gulf of Tonkin Nor is it clear that the stocks can be rebuilt, because a recent study shows that four of five critical species show no improvement under current fishing regulations Another recent Chinese study is similarly pessimistic: "Fishing methods in thirty-two [Chinese] fishing ports [reveal] ... trawling intensity greatly exceeds the reproduction capacity of fishery resources, and the fishing yields are of low value and immaturity the potential for environmental crises, such as fisheries, to straddle across borders and have an impact on key international relationships is high. The opposite conclusion, however, also holds true: that international cooperation will be the key to coping with many of China's environmental problems the world has no choice but to work with China to mitigate the environmental impact of its rise.
India, located in South Asia, has a population of 1.2 billion people and is on its way to becoming the world’s most populous nation by 2030. However, the country still struggles with providing its growing population with access to quality healthcare, potable water, education and clean energy. The education sector requires special attention, since so much of the nation’s personal and national development is based upon it. India, being a developing nation, has struggled in this area for a very long time. between 30 and 40 million children of primary school age were out of school. Foreign aid to India, as a result, proves to be an effective investment in this arena, and there are many ways foreign aid has advanced education in India. One of the ways foreign aid has advanced education in India is by initiating projects that focus on improving the sector from its core. one of the three major goals of USAID’s Global Education Strategy is “improved reading skills for 100 million children in primary grades Focus on the children in primary grades is essential, as so much of a country’s future depends on it. an increase of one standard deviation in student reading and math scores is associated with an increase of two percentage points in annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth the Teacher Innovation in Practice program works to positively impact the teaching practices of 14,657 teachers to improve early grade reading outcomes of more than 564,000 primary school children in the states of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in India. By developing teachers’ mindsets, building an enabling environment and improving pedagogical skills and knowledge, the main goal of this program is to reignite teacher motivation to drive better student learning outcomes. Other initiatives focus on improving the literacy rate in the country India reportedly spends a mere 3 percent of its GDP on education, making foreign aid geared towards development in the educational sector crucial. Foreign aid has advanced education in India significantly over the years. For instance, the literacy rate increased to 65.4 percent in 2001, and currently sits at 74.04 percent. with continued support from foreign investments, India will be able to develop its education sector, thereby potentially boosting its economy and reducing poverty.
The United States plays a unique role in the global economy. global trade—of which the U.S. accounts for 11 percent. 20 percent of global manufacturing value-added America’s global financial ties are even deeper. Foreign banks hold about $5½ trillion of U.S. assets American banks hold about $3 trillion of foreign claims close to half of the S&P500’s sales originate from foreign operation interconnections have great benefits for the United States. But they are not without risks—two-way risks—and we saw some of these play out during this crisis. the collapse of one U.S. bank ushered in a harsh new reality across sectors, across countries, and across the world Considering that 20 percent of U.S. exports are destined for Europe, and that more than half of U.S. overseas assets are held in Europe, you clearly have a large stake in the recovery there. when we are all prosperous, the trade with each becomes more valuable to the other What was true in President Taft’s day is even more true in today’s interconnected world: a strong U.S. economy and a strong global economy are two sides of the same coin.
China and the U.S. are amidst a global paradigm of financial interdependence with great opportunity for international cooperation One of the greatest opportunities is for China and America to share the policing of the global commons America’s decreased reliance on foreign oil facilitates this option China’s current naval strategy is regionally focused is evolving into a global strategy facilitated by the protection of sea routes the United States can leverage or compliment China’s growing role in securing the commons U.S. and Chinese navies, operating under a collaborative agreement, can develop a relationship to protect shared interests This coordination may galvanize security commitments from China while allowing U.S. military planners to better fund strategic objectives Such cooperation with China would also reduce the potential for misunderstanding, confrontation and conflict with the U.S The fact that the U.S. military is getting smaller while the Chinese Army is growing is both a concern and an opportunity China lacks the naval capacity of the U.S. the U.S. military has the ability to facilitate the flow of energy to China an increased Chinese maritime hand in the region would not only ease the burden on the U.S. military as a global police force, but will ensure U.S.-Chinese national strategies grow dependent on each other On the Korean peninsula, China and U.S. share the desire for stability and peace The regional message facilitated by increased military cooperation between China and the United States could deflate North Korean saber-rattling risk , is largely mitigated by the fact that China has a greater need for stability in these straits than any other nation There are greater risks for both nations in failing to partner to stabilize the maritime lines
Although areas of the West Coast have sig-nificant wind resources, the West has a much larger population to serve, and California's new renewable energy man-dates likely can only be fulfilled through significant wind development California had 4,425 MW of wind energy capacity online, rank-ing it third in the nation for total installed MW ranking it sixteenth among the states in percentage of state energy derived from wind California has one of the most aggressive RPSs set utility-specific targets, the standard requires 33% of electricity sold in California to be generated by renewable energy California has created a structure of three "buckets" to meet the statutory obligations of the RPS: (1) RPS-qualifying products generated within the state or a California balancing authority, (2) products that are used to ensure power quality and provide incremental power, and (3) unbundled RECs (where the electric power is used separately from the environmental benefit, for example when wind energy is generated and used in Oregon, will connect to the grid through the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project. n193 Despite the CPUC's approval of the project, Chino Hills sued to enforce its ability to grant right-of-way property rights, and to deny the CPUC's exclusive jurisdiction in this area. The state trial court held in 2010 that the CPUC had exclusive jurisdiction RPS limits the amount that can be generated outside of California. n196 While Arizona and Nevada can provide solar energy in the future if certain major projects come online, California has historically looked to Oregon for more immediately available wind energy RPS are subject to a fine. n202 In 2010, Oregon began a pilot program for solar feed-in tariffs that offered payments by three participating utilities to [*1840] owners of solar energy systems for electricity produced by solar power. While Oregon's policies have encouraged renewable growth, the state has not directly addressed the need for new transmission lines. n207 Similar to other states, "Oregon faces a growing schism between its lack of capacity to move en-ergy from renewable sources The first OEPC report, in December 2010, recommended "the state move forward with developing a comprehensive energy strategy to maintain its leadership in energy planning, conservation, and new renewable technology Shep-herd's Flat Wind Farm in Oregon, which is likely to be the largest in the world when completed. n214 The $ 2 billion pro-ject has received $ 100 million in funding from Google n215 as well as a $ 1.3 billion loan guarantee from the DOE. n216 The wind farm has received transmission rights massive amounts of hydroelectric power [*1842] swamped Bonneville Power Association's ("BPA") electric grid, causing BPA to curtail wind energy. n221 BPA insists that it did everything it could to incorporate wind into the sys-tem, but wind developers have built much faster than the Northwest Wind Integration Action Plan of 2007 predicted. n222 Wind farms filed a petition with FERC in the summer of 2011, These developments in California and Oregon illustrate how states, even ones as large as California, cannot rely solely on their own renewable resources or transmission buildout to meet renewable energy goals.

Some developing nations have a legitimate beef with the “multi-stakeholder” model of Internet governance that the U.S. champions, the State Department’s ambassador to the Internet acknowledged yesterday. The current slate of stakeholders just isn’t diverse enough, In theory, the multi-stakeholder model means major decisions about how the Internet is organized are made by technical specialists at ICANN and other consensus-based non-profits rather than by national governments or multi-national organizations such as the United Nations however, those non-profits are inordinately filled with Western government representatives, Western companies and Western civil society member
the release of car- bon dioxide (CO2) from our industrial and agricultural activities, commonly referred to as “anthropogenic CO2” has resulted in an increase in atmospheric CO2concentrations 30% of the in- crease occurring in the last three decades These changes in CO2are projected to cause signiﬁcant temperature increases in the atmosphere and the ocean surface in the coming decades Over the industrial era, the ocean has absorbed about 30% of anthropogenic carbon emissions. when anthropogenic CO 2is absorbed by sea- water chemical reactions occur that reduce both sea- water pH and the concentration of carbonate ions in a process known as “ocean acidiﬁcation” By the middle of this century atmospheric CO2levels could reach more than 500 ppm, and over 800 ppm by the end of the century (Orret al., 2005). This would result in an additional decrease in surface water pH of approximately 0.3 pH units by 2100. As a result, acidity in the ocean would increase by about 150% relative to the beginning of the industrial era.
No one who has surveyed the condition of public education, spent time in second- ary and university classrooms, or assessed the status of conventional knowledge and its transmission, reception, and application in the United States can doubt that an old order of literacy has passed. The pastoral, idyllic lyrics of "Schooldays, schooldays, dear old golden rule days," have given way to the postmodern indirection that Spike Lee calls "School Daze." A traditional order of "reading and writing and arithmetic" has yielded-in some cases, to alternative pedagogies and subjects, but more often to deliberate or slovenly indifference. There may well exist a dire problem of literacy in our society, but we need seri- ously to ask in what terms we are to confront this problem. We seem, for example, to have given up on one traditional approach. "Why Johnny can't read" is not, for example, a serious query toda The nostalgia for a seriously-conceived and resolutely economic dedication to Johnny's problem is, per- haps, only a kind of sixties regressiveness. Currently-projected explanations for John- ny's relationship to literacy begin not with serious analysis, informed economics, or a commitment to situational reform. We are told, instead, that Johnny is a sufferer in the wake of wild-eyed radicals ("thugs" is sometimes the word used) of the sixties who brought the United States to desperate straits by abandoning Western ideals, misreading Nietzsche, and kicking prayer and the hickory stick out of the American classroom. We are urged to return to old, common ideas that "every American" needs to know, to put a legacy of acknowledged "Great Books" back into place, and to let the philos- ophers have their head in the maintenance of State affairs. Who is there to challenge this new Zion of whitemale literary evangelism? This chosen interpretation of a "crisis" and its solution? Johnny himself, of course-perhaps not in the voice and guise of Homer and the Classics, but surely in the voice and person of a new hybridity of interests and values. And Johnny, like his sister Johnetta, has a huge stake in such a challenge, because it is, finally, not book-learning, but the bodies of OTHERS that are most decisively in "crisis." That is to say, while whites may have the privilege of endlessly rehearsing a bookish dilemma, what I have described as newly-emergent people and voices have no such luxury. For behind the facade of a "battle of the books," as I have already suggested, lies a terrain of global realignment and multinational economic competition where what Bourdieu calls "cultural capital" has created radically new balances of exchange. While Spartan Greek youth wear walkmans from Japan and dance to the hip-hop rhythms of Run DMC, Salt-n-Peppa, N.W.A., and Public Enemy, whitemale cultural literacists nostalgically croon for a return of Homeric highlights and virtually sanction the disappearance of the very bodies that make United States' popular, public culture a valued currency of global exchange - and an informed source of critique for a postmodern world. In a too shorthanded manner, then, one might say that Johnny and Johnetta can't read "the classics" because neither the classics nor their advocates have realigned themselves and their project to read Johnny or Johnetta-or to listen to them, or to comprehend their postmodern connectedness to a re-formed future. You simply can- not teach a class of people whose life, language, and mores you don't in the least comprehend or respect. Indoctrinate, yes; teach, no. telecommunal viewing spaces today-the American literacists who preach of "crisis" have adopted a strategy of willful ignorance and, ultimately, sanctioned aggression. Conserving the definite article the for humanities conceived only in selective, West- ern terms is the first move in the dance. The third and decisive move is-in a telecommunal age-to couch the crisis of the humanities in bookish terms, as though reading and writing were not mere technologies that favored an order of privileged ascendency and selective power and ideological control known even to Thoth and his King long ago. The fourth move in the current "crisis" project is to rid the kingdom of the very bodies of those who represent a "cultural" threat to what the literacists define as "our" national interest. There have been more than 250 incidents of bias- related aggression on American campuses during the past two years alone (1987- 1989). Of course, the inner-city public schools of America and the deteriorating, crime- filled neighborhoods in which they fight to serve an educational mission in the absence of adequate funding or enlightened concern from the federal government offer further testimony to a killing indifference of our "crisis" thinkers. The OTHERS' defense of self is, thus, an inferable necessity of the current "crisis" in the humanities. Such a defense begins with dramatically reconceptualized self-definitions by people who are products of a history that has yet to be written. With bodies on the line and life itself at stake, it hardly seems strange that Johnny might regard our cur- rent "crisis" advocates of "cultural literacy" as avatars of those white missionaries who paved the way for slavetraders, armies, and curious colonial scholars of the past. Johnny and his fellows have bolted from the schools and given birth to energetic expressive forms such as postmodern hip-hop, interventionist film culture, and radical scholarship into gender, class, and race determinants of power and knowledge in the world we inhabit. In many ways, the powerful, syncretic, corporally minimalistic urgings of African- American rap music signal this legitime defense of a new humanity and a new humanities that will outlast the current "crisis" and create new room for the new people. One hears Public Enemy cautioning those who might be drawn into a sham "battle of the books" with the injunction: "Don't, don't, don't believe the hype!" Perhaps it is because rap is so effective in its expressive counters to a bookish "crisis" that those who "have had their chance" seek so forcefully to suppress it. Rap is the metonym for all of those shared sonics that emergent generations have brought to their own defense, to their own expressive soundings of the world. The "crisis" in the humanities (as I suggested earlier) may finally be like the FBI's buffoonish objectionism-a crisis of audition, a violent, reactionary cry by whitemen who have never bothered to listen to the rhythms and lyrics of OTHERS. Such willful disregard and lamentable ignorance may serve the moment, but, finally, they offer the surest path to white cultural illiteracy. Today's "crisis" will only begin to abate when American whitemale nostalgia for ancient exclusionism gives way to conscientious audition and constructive pedagogy and scholarship based on the sounds of a postmodern world. If we add "bookish" or "Great Bookish" to Baldwin's announcement we have, I think, fundamental postulates for listening be- yond the thresholds of our present "crisis" to sounds of a safer and more liberating future.
(JI) still poses a real threat to Indonesia and the region The religious militant group remains Indonesia’s major security threat today. JI also remains a regional threat to the Southeast Asia region as it commands a force structure within the four Mantiqis it helped to set up in Southeast Asia JI has close and direct links with Al Qaeda The relationship between JI and Al Qaeda remains a close knit relationship The Indonesian government has also been complacent in its operations to counter terrorism Indonesian authorities also are divided with issues pertaining to religion and what constitutes religious extremism and militancy Power struggle and corruption within the government add to the political discourse of Indonesia. security forces on the island are not able to address a foreseen “terrorist” attack judging from the local authorities’ capabilities Concerns are also growing that a steady flow of JI and extremist groups are also infiltrating the system. Sources claim that there are a number of JI “sleeping cells” within the Bali Island and this to me is alarming. financing of “religious extremism” is still evident in Indonesia coming from the Middle East This is not only of a terrorist attack but in all senses of “security”. The laid back attitude of the local authorities is seen to some extent The threat of maritime terrorist attack in the Straits of Malacca uncovered by US troops in Afghanistan clearly indicate the plans of JI in the maritime domain Is JI able to mount a maritime attack on the island’s port areas? From my views, yes! The security parameter did not seem too convincing. The parameter was open to small boats which could easily move into close proximity of the vessels simply the security protocols were not evident. Terrorist groups could easily plant explosive devices under and around the tanker without being noticed or simply by hijacking the vessel this sort of security protocols give leeways for easy targeting. A maritime attack could be devastating to Bali’s coastal waters. JI is still relevant and its links to Al Qaeda and the terrorist groups in the region is evermore a concern. The threats of maritime terrorism using piracy as a means to achieve its goals are tightly linked together Maritime terrorism as a transnational threat is also evident and the reality seems to be very prospective for all groups in terms of the monetary gains it offers Proactive measures should be in place immediately before the island is influenced by extremism and terrorism. This eventually will be harder to curtail within the island if left untreated.
A  E  I and The Heritage Foundation’s China Global Investment Tracker follows large Chinese investments The leading recipient of these kinds of investments is the United States which received $100 billion between January 2005 and December 2015. The deals are worth $100 million or more and are voluntary transactions Chinese investment helps support a small number of American jobs. American policymakers should be aware that most Chinese firms have little familiarity with a competitive market under the rule of law, so their ability and willingness to obey American law should be monitored.

Many believe racial equality already has been achieved, while many hold little has changed One side declares, ‘Racial harmony has arrived.’ The other side replies, ‘Racial harmony will never come.’ the truth lies in the middle. Two things are undeniable racial progress in America has been nothing short of astounding and racial domination in America has yet to be dismantled. As one sociologist put it, ‘It can be said, unconditionally, that changes over the past fifty years are unparalleled in the history of minority–majority relations... .There does not exist a single case in modern or early history that comes anywhere near the record of America in changing majority attitudes guaranteeing legal and political rights, and in expanding socioeconomic opportunities for its disadvantaged minorities’ If we refuse to recognize this fact, we foster an angry spirit of cynicism and nihilism, a spirit of hopelessness that causes whites and non-whites to throw up their hands and conclude, ‘If racial equality is hopeless, then why should we do anything to fight it?’ Change has come to America some ethnic conflicts viewed as intractable and eternal a mere 100 years ago hardly exist today. One thinks of conflict between Protestants and Catholics Irish and Italians The historical record demonstrates that what one generation found unrealistic and impossible the succeeding generation made into reality What is considered impossible today may be possible tomorrow It is well to remember that in the 1950s few Americans believed that a revolution in civil rights was just around the corner We cannot deny the progress of the past, just as we cannot the problems of the present Social science is able to provide a much-needed picture of alternative realities. It can, in a phrase, present us with real utopias. Creative and radical alternatives for society ‘grounded in the real potentials of humanity’ as well as in carefully designed blueprints for a better tomorrow they are realistic renderings of a society more just, equal, and moral than the one we currently inhabit. Real utopias are hopeful but not naïve; realistic but not cynical To work toward racial justice, we must know precisely what we are working toward

But even though Congress has, through NCLB, been clear in setting forth a regulatory framework for public education at the state and local level, the Department of Education is acting now to "waive" that framework in order to give the states, and their derivative local authorities, "flexibility." Most notably, instead of "all students" being proficient by the end of the 2013-2014 school year, a State may set "annual measurable objectives" that are "ambitious but achievable": It will suffice if the State proposes yet another method "that is educationally sound and results in ambitious but achievable" annual measureable objectives.42 The sanctions for failing schools also need not be as stringent as the statute itself specifies the Department proposes to substitute a new way of defining what is required to get the grant and a new way of measuring and enforcing compliance for the way that the Act itself had specified.
This is an opportune time for governors to take stock of their STEM initiatives. it is important to harmonize the STEM education agenda Governors should ask the following questions:
it is also important to consider the history of private schools that led to the concentration of white students  white students are also more likely to attend private schools than black or Latino students from families with the same income In some cases, especially in the South, predominantly white private schools were created as the result of deliberate efforts by white Christian parents to start private schools as an alternative to public schools, which were being integrated at the time. Many “segregation academies” refused admission to nonwhite students when they were created, and still remain de facto segregated. Discriminatory admission practices and school policies continue today. some private schools receiving public funds through vouchers in North Carolina, for example, restrict enrollment to Christian students, have policies enforcing gender norms and rejecting admission of LGBT students, or have discriminatory dress codes banning head scarves or limiting the size of afros. the history and current practices of some predominantly white private schools may make it unlikely that many students of color using vouchers would choose to attend or be admitted by these schools
detention beds are reserved for unauthorized immigrants who pose the greatest risks to public security. But ICE has often detained lower-risk immigrants Alternative-to-detention (ATD) programs have been a part of ICE’s operations for several years These programs generally require 24-hour surveillance; immigrants are supervised by case managers through period check-ins and, at times, unannounced home visits.
there are all sorts of things people do that they are eager to keep private, even though these sorts of things do not constitute doing “something wrong.” Privacy is indispensable to a wide range of human activities. If someone calls a suicide hotline or visits an abortion provider or frequents an online sex website or makes an appointment with a rehabilitation clinic or is treated for a disease, or if a whistle-blower calls a reporter, there are many reasons for keeping such acts private that have no connection to illegality or wrongdoing
It is long overdue in the US for us to have a genuine conversation and struggle over our current economic system. Capitalism has gotten a free pass , we have failed to similarly question, challenge, criticise and debate our economic system: capitalism. Because a taboo protected capitalism, cheerleading and celebrating it became obligatory. Criticism and questions got banished as heresy, disloyalty or worse.  Capitalism is the problem – and the joblessness, homelessness, insecurity, and austerity it now imposes everywhere are the costs we bear. We have the people, the skills and the tools to produce the goods and services needed for a just society to prosper. We just need to reorganise our producing units differently, to go beyond a capitalist economic system that no longer serves our needs. Humanity learned to do without kings and emperors and slave masters. . The US can do better than corporate capitalism." Let that be an idea and a debate that this renewed movement can engage. Doing so would give an immense gift to the US and the world. It would break through the taboo, finally subjecting capitalism to the critiques and debates it has evaded for far too long – and at far too great a cost to all of us.

Heidegger's negligence of colonialism, slavery, and modernity all initiated prior to the political crises of the twentieth century means he gets to join the ranks of philosophers which constitute a Western tradition of white thought I refer to 'whiteness' as the normalization of white supremacy and white dominance, while racial grammar makes certain ideas intelligible in normalized spaces through a rhetoric of universalism bound to power and hegemony we can consider Heidegger's conceptualization of death as coming from a space of whiteness because of its representation as non-relational, singularizing, and its relation to mastery and subjectivity. Heidegger ignores how Western colonial projects which violently threw Africans across the Atlantic Ocean and enslaved them stripped its victims of their social and political freedoms and at times subjected them to deaths including lynching, torture, and mass disease. mastery and subjectivity must be seen as normalized white capabilities. colonial projects were driven by the desire to master geopolitical space and to master the enslaved African body slavery, and its relation to mastery and 'full' subjectivity reveals an iteration of death foreclosed by Heidegger's discussion Death-as-possibility-to-be-killed-socially-and-politically-and-biologically-by-theexperience-of-slavery-and-colonial-violence. I have revealed the whiteness of Heidegger's death by situating his concept Being-towards-death alongside pre-Holocaust Western colonial projects Through his un/racial grammar of universality, Heidegger forecloses the possibility of a relational death. Heidegger's death becomes incredibly fragile when supplemented by one word: white. While Heidegger's involvement with the Nazi party may have been convoluted, his whiteness certainly was not.
Even if Cuba ends its repressive human rights policies disputes between the United States and Cuba must be resolved before any easing of the embargo is considered ongoing trademark issues would need to be addressed before the two nations could work toward normalizing relations During the embargo several companies have used brand names that originated in Cuba, as increasingly strict federal laws have barred companies affiliated with the Cuban government from registering their products in the United States Without the embargo in place the clash over the rightful ownership of these trademarks could stretch from the U.S. courts to Congress to the boardrooms of some of the largest U.S. corporations In particular, disputes involving Cohiba cigars have spanned approximately a decade each in litigation Cohiba cigar cases illustrate the trademark friction that exists between the United States and Cuba as a result of the trade embargo.

Venezuela's human population has roughly doubled , it is possible tha resource use rates increased simply as a consequence of the expanding population. However, if the economic crisis signicantly affected patterns of resource use, a change in rates pre- and post-economic crisis above and beyond that explained by population growth should be detect able. the rate of increase of resource use after 1983 surpassed the rate of increase of the human population If this is the case, mechanisms apart from population growth triggered by the economic crisis  should account for increases in harvest the degradation of biodiversity may be the direct or indirect consequence of economic growth. the expan- sion of the economies of the industrialized world has resulted in a variety of impacts ranging from dramatic transformations of the landscape and of the structure of marine food webs to the combustion of vast quantities of fossil fuels that may cause drastic changes on the global climate and negatively aect all life on earth
. If we wished to name that "country" where the Clausewitzian ideal of absolute war is most demonstrably visible-where terrorism is almost celebrated- -then it could be no other than America Heidegger seems to imply an inability for America to think "the question of being" and couches this inability in the current reality of the American situation:

Not only has the science about chemical and biological weapons been quite sophisticated for more than a century, but that science has become massively more developed over that period. governments have spent a great deal of money over decades in an effort to make the weapons more effective. Yet the difficulties of controlling and dispersing chemical and biological substances seem to have persisted. the experience in the 1990s of the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo suggests there are great difficulties. The group had some 300 scientists in its employ and an estimated budget of $1 billion, and it reportedly tried at least nine times over five years to set off biological weapons by spraying pathogens from trucks and wafting them from rooftops, hoping fancifully to ignite an apocalyptic war. These efforts failed to create a single fatality; in fact, nobody even noticed that the attacks had taken place. there have been so few biological (and chemical) terrorist attacks because they would require overcoming several major technical hurdles. Among them: gaining access to specialized ingredients, acquiring equipment and know-how to produce and disperse the agents, and creating an organization that can resist infiltration or early detection by law enforcement As easy as some argue that it may be for terrorists to culture anthrax spores or brew up a concoction of deadly nerve gas, the effective dissemination or dispersal of these viruses and poisons still presents serious technological hurdles that greatly inhibit their effective use
A major new initiative for the promotion of food self-sufficiency has been urban agriculture urban gardening was the first reaction of the population to overcoming food At the beginning of the crisis, people organized themselves to cultivate vacant lots, backyards and rooftops in the cities. Even animals were reared inside the houses in order to assure the families’ food supply. From the middle of the 1990s, urban agriculture was transformed from subsistence production to a practice that also included commercial activities It was based in the use of local resources and minimum transportation costs of both inputs and products By 1995, there were already 1,613 organoponics (i.e. small plots of abandoned land in the cities where beds of soil and sources of organic matter are used to produce fresh vegetables), 429 intensive gardens and 26,604 community gardens. In 1997, a network of municipal enterprises and State institutions (the National System of Urban Agriculture) was created to organize the people already involved in urban agriculture. The government still plays an important promotion and support role in this massive movement towards food security The basic principles of urban agriculture in Cuba define its objectives and organization Intensive use of organic matter to increase and conserve soil fertility • Employment of biological pest controls Use of all available land to produce food, guaranteeing intensive but not import-dependent high yields of crops and livestock Maximum use of the food production potential, such as the available labor force and the recycling of wastes and by-products for plant nutrients and animal feed organizational and administrative base of the urban agriculture program is the 28 sub-programs related to all aspects of animal and plant production subprograms include management and conservation of soils, use of organic matter, seed production, vegetables and fresh herbs and spices, fruit trees, popular production of rice, grains, animal feed, apiculture, livestock, aquaculture, marketing, small agro-industries urban agriculture has the components to achieve a systems approach; however, each program is supervised separately, responding to its specific factors and providing specialized technical assistance. production of rice (arroz popular) was originally a grassroots movement towards self-provisioning. People started to cultivate this cereal in abandoned areas, in small plots between sugar cane fields in road ditches, etc. This movement grew rapidly and achieved unforeseen levels of production and efficiency In the year 2000, urban agriculture produced more than 1.64 million tons of vegetables and employed 201,000 workers Two years later, 326,000 people were linked with the program of urban backyard production, benefiting some 75% of the population (Granma 2005 the production was 4.1 million tons and employed 354,000 people products distributed via this network significantly contribute to food security although the prices are still high considering the average buying capacity of the population The quantity of people dedicated to agricultural labor in the city periphery continues to increase this type of agriculture, emerging as a solution to food scarcity and unemployment in the cities ought to look for a more integrated approach that goes beyond a temporary solution to the crisis and toward a more holistic concept than just food security. They suggest a concept which emphasizes the preservation of urban environment and the permanent management of resources in the urban settings, avoiding pollution of air and water as well as creating a culture of nature conservation. The input substitution strategy step for the conversion towards a more sustainable agriculture
for the conservatives, international law either doesn't exist or is a tool of some combination of our French") allies and our enemies. Thus, they regard international law as so sullied that it cannot even be invoked directly.
praise for the amateur has its limits. To ignore the need for critical disciplinary intellectuals with various forms of scientific expertise is to abdicate responsibility for a host of issues involving knowledge of fields ranging from physics and genetics to electronics and even environmentalism. There is surely an overabundance of jargon and mystification and the need exists for a new sensitivity to the vernacular But it is also the case that complex issues sometimes require complex language and, often for good reasons, fields generate their own vocabularies There must be a place for the technocrat with a political conscience as surely as for the humanist with a particular specialty. The battle against oppression requires a multi-frontal strategy. Best to understand the critical intellectual as a "person educated beyond his daily trade, whose culture is alive insofar as it makes an effort to renew itself, and keep up to date, and who does not react with indifference or irritation when confronted by any branch of knowledge, even though, obviously, he cannot cultivate all of them."
a focus on surveillance requires explicit attention to critical feminist concerns. The "'critical" part of our project- as implicit in our use of the term feminist - hails from a critical tradition that has at its core all activist and. interventionist agenda, and a questioning of the taken -for-granted, of what is often mundane and seamless with a profound sense that what goes unquestioned can be dangerous, particularly for disenfranchised bodies. Our critical feminist approach involves a feminist praxis that , centers intersectionality. surveillance is inseparable from  interlocking oppressions e understand a feminist praxis to highIight the interaction between theory and practice that is greater than the sum of those parts A feminist praxis is not limited to gender issues, but rather sees gender as part and parcel of a number of contingent issues~ such as race, sexuality, class~ and able- and disabledbodiedness insisting that these cannot be viewed in isolation How we engage questions related to surveillance-and what can be left out in these articulations- is key New technologies have had pernicious implications for individual and group privac Privacy is, however, a limited lens for thinking about surveillance, since it is a right not granted equally to all, a fact that needs to be taken into account in such investigations we need to ask the larger questions: who is considered to have a right to privacy? Whose privacy is not a concern and why"? And importantly, how might a focus on these questions shape the field of surveillance studies privacy concerns have not kept vulnerable communities safer in the case of patriarchal violence, which often happens in the private·· space of the home. part of the project of a feminist approach to surveillance studies is to 'shift critical surveillance studies away from matters of privacy~ security, and efficiency to a consideration of the ethical problem of combatting new forms of discrimination that are practiced in relation to categories of privilege, access, and risk" the ways in which supposedly ~neutral" technologies are used requires a feminist analysis to access issues of disenfranchisement
There is no one supreme legislative grant augmenting federal surveillance powers . There is no effective point of origin from which to begin analyzing legislative conferrals of surveillance authority But FISA n31 is perhaps the logical starting point because it established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court The FISA Court is presently the body empowered to curb federal surveillance power: it considers governmental requests for surveillance warrants.
The next challenge is to establish what exactly being under a state’s jurisdiction means and entails to be applicable to foreign surveillance activities, the following section outlines the major findings of the HRC and the ECtHR on extraterritoriality First Extraterritorial Steps jurisdiction’ has emerged as the basis of sovereignty and state’s sovereign powers, the original notion of jurisdiction is necessarily linked with the idea of territorial powers. jurisdiction is closely related to the national territory. in the interventionist age we live the question of human rights treaties’ applicability although vague in terms of the exact guarantees’ scope is quite significant the Convention’s application with the requirement of effective control employed by a State Party in a certain area. What mattered was the question of effective control, regardless of whether it was based on an unlawful act violation of the territorial state’s sovereignty the need to reject the otherwise resulting ‘regrettable vacuum in the system of human-rights protection’ the effective control over territory or over individuals test represents the best synthesis of the current extraterritorial jurisprudence The NSA has the capacity to remotely control and filter much of the communications of a foreign national abroad and the agency can break different forms of encryptions thanks to ‘back-doors’ it has engineered in many software systems much of the Internet traffic is routed through the US, makes the picture complete – physical control does not play a role at all the virtual control test as an approach that at least for now can meet this challenge Applying this standard has two advantages: first, it works closely with the notion of control developed and required in the jurisprudence discussed above; second, it considers and bridges the changing technological circumstances that any practitioner would face when dealing with questions of jurisdiction triggering human rights obligations in surveillance cases. Without a proper assimilation of the effective control test in cyberspace these intrusions would remain unaddressed and would run counter to substantial human rights principles The virtual control test is thus preferable when assessing the extraterritorial application of privacy interests in cases of foreign surveillance. the problem with the extraterritorial application is constituted by the fact that interventions abroad take place in forms other than extensive and long-term military operations and occupations the foreign state acting abroad cannot be expected to also positively ensure or protect human rights, for it does not have the respective powers to adopt any legislative, judicial or administrative or other appropriate measures in order to fulfil its positive legal obligations the approach is everything but conclusive.
In a neoliberal state the ‘‘institutional arrangements considered essential to guarantee individual freedoms are strong individual property rights, the rule of law, and the institutions of freely functioning markets and free trade.’ The state’s role is to secure and protect these rights the Minutemen are willing to concede that some undocumented people are not terrorists but, rather, desperate for work. The Minutemen support the creation of a guest worker program ‘‘All we ask is that immigrants come through the gate and sign the guestbook.’’ A guest worker program temporarily resolves the tensions inherent in the need for a mobile labor force and for secure borders. It answers the question of how the very people one defines as threats to national security and purity can also be given some kind of provisional legal status given their critical status to the economy—to the homes and gardens of middle-class Americans, to the hotels and restaurants of every city, to the meatpacking plants of Iowa and Nebraska, to the vineyards and orchards of California. one rationale is that such a program would help distinguish between legitimate workers and potential security threats The market sets the terms for ‘‘the rule of law’’—‘‘aliens’’ can become temporarily legal and thus gain some rights if they prove their worth to the nation as productive workers and potential consumers. This is just a temporary state of belonging, however, for Bush’s guest worker program requires that workers eventually return to their home countries The border must remain open to the regulated flow of workers back and forth as well as to the flow of goods back and forth across the border—produced in the maquiladoras by cheap Mexican labor and consumed in the U S The work of the good citizen/volunteer provides the legitimation for more insidious and violent forms of vigilantism and state-sponsored militarism that come to seem necessary, even normalized, given the current security crisis. If Homeland Security and the volunteer force are doing all they can to seal the borders, doesn’t that then suggest there is a need for more militaristic solutions? Adherence to the law today becomes the rationale for future violations of the law. Some Minutemen chapters have said they will carry weapons. The Minutemen are attracting neo-Nazis even if they are not recruiting them. Internet Web sites for different border vigilante groups show the overlap of the right-wing extremists, theMinutemen, and the military. The vigilante in neoliberal times functions not as a complete renegade but rather in conjunction with the government, both entities acting outside the law, in the name of the law, in order to enforce the law. The Border Patrol responds to the Minutemen If the person held is charged with any violation at all, such as aminor infraction of immigration law, he or she can be held indefinitely. The judicial system has assisted in creating camplike conditions of extended detention where detainees have virtually no rights. Agamben argues that the passage of the Patriot Act reveals the extent to which the state of exception has become permanent, for under it individuals have no legal status, thus ‘‘producing a legally unnamable and unclassifiable being’’ subject to a ‘‘detention that is indefinite not only in the temporal sense but in its very nature as well, since it is entirely removed from the law and from judicial oversight, Along the border there are growing numbers of detention centers; many of them are contracted out to private entities and are becoming the mainstays of local economies. At the intersections of security and economy lies the truth of neoliberalism’s defense of the powerful. Any attempt to prevent ‘‘terrorists’’ from entering the United States must not infringe on corporate profits. Given its reliance on the maquiladora industry, Mexico has had little choice but to work with the United States on border control When the U.S.-Mexico border becomes a normalized state of exception, the U.S. government finds it easier to expand the very contours of the border, again in the name of national security. The House of Representatives subcommittee report quoted above said that one component of the U.S. strategy to build ‘‘smarter borders’’ is through ‘‘pushing our borders out, pushing our zone of security out beyond our physical borders so America’s borders are not the last line of defense, nor the first line of defense, against terrorism. Mexico becomes the permeable barrier between the United States and the rest of Latin America, a purported breeding ground for terrorists; history repeats itself with the variation that Middle East terrorists replace the ‘‘communist threat’’ and other leftist movements—or, rather, that they all join together. There is already considerable evidence to show that the United States is using 9/11 as a rationale for weakening fragile democracies With all of that ‘‘ungoverned space’’ to bring under control, the U.S. government is warranted, it appears to the wider public, in turning to the Minutemen and other vigilante groups who will help maintain the U.S.-Mexico border as a governed space, the ‘‘last frontier’’ in what Agamben calls a ‘‘global civil war.’’38 Resistance arises from within the discourses and material conditions of neoliberalism rearticulation is possible and indeed necessary for the imagining of a new—more just and life-sustaining—configuration of the U.S.-Mexico border.
The tech bubble doesn't exist. Andreessen Horowitz's data show that private and public funding for tech companies remains at about 40 percent of what it was in 1999. There's been no surge in venture capital fundraising. It's rising but still below 2006 levels. And venture capital funding as a percentage of the gross domestic product created by the sector is down by half since 1980.∂ There's also a real market for these businesses now The number of Internet users has increased from 738 million in 2000 to 3.2 billion in 2015, according to a new report from the International Telecommunication Union. Venture funding per person online has been flat since the bubble, while people are spending more on it.∂ Instead, almost all of the returns are being had in private markets, meaning without a company going public. In other words, you have to know someone or be a large institutional investor to be able to buy equity in privately held companies like Uber even though its estimated worth is some $40 billion.∂ Overall dollars raised by technology companies are being dominated by such deals.
China condemned America's human-rights record alluding to the White House campaign and suggesting that "money politics and family politics went from bad to worse The broadside came amid heightening tensions in the South China Sea It was a response to a global human-rights survey issued by the State Department which criticized China and other countries report cited China's "particularly severe" crackdown on the legal community and "extralegal measures" of enforced disappearances and house arrest against government critics. "The United States made comments on the human-rights situation in many countries while being tight-lipped about its own terrible human-rights record and showing not a bit of intention to reflect on it," Xinhua said.  China alleged the "wanton infringement" of civil rights and "rampant gun-related crimes" in the United States, The frequent occurrence of shooting incidents was the deepest impression left to the world 560,000 people were homeless and said that 33 million Americans didn't have health insurance
The long-term cost of selling out our principles for a quick fix, , would be high. Let’s start where all public policy ought to start, but where almost none does start these days—with the U.S. Constitution. Title I portability would take advantage of, and thereby strengthen, one of the most important ways in which the federal government tramples on federalism: grant programs. In almost every area of policy, from education to poverty to medicine to police, the federal government saps state and local control by offering states and localities funding. These funds come with strings attached, putting the federal government in the driver’s seat. The real problem is not where the money goes but where the money comes from The federal government gets the money for Title I and other federal grant programs by taking it from the states by taxing their citizens. Each state has a limited tax base; its citizens can only pay so much in taxes Higher federal taxes reduce the ability of states and localities to raise their own tax revenue. We gave the federal government the power to tax us in order to fund federal programs If the federal government can tax the citizens of the states in order to fund state programs, imposing its own mandates as a condition of receiving the funds, then we no longer really have state governments. The states are just administrative departments of the federal government.
the center of the analysis in this chapter is a concern with the fixation social science research has exhibited in eliciting pain stories from com- munities that are not White, not wealthy, and not straight. Academe's demonstrated fascination with telling and retelling narratives of pain is troubling, both for its voyeurism and for its consumptive implacability. Imagining "itself to be the voice of the colonised much of the work of the academy is to reproduce stories of oppression in its own voice novice researchers emerge from doctoral programs eager to launch pain-based inquiry projects because they believe that such approaches embody what it means to do social science. The collection of pain narratives and the theories of change that champion the value of such narratives are so prevalent in the social sciences that one might surmise that they are indeed what the academy is about.
China’s economic growth has driven and been fuelled by a large energy requirement. It is questionable whether China can stop this pattern  energy is  required to support further economic growth. , the peak of energy consumption is expected to occur later than the peak production year for both oil and coal rapid expansion of China’s automobile fleet. Fast economic development has brought continuous improvement in people’s living standards, and these manifest themselves in a booming demand for automobiles   . Transportation will continue to consume more energy, especially oil, since other forms of energy cannot yet substitute for oil as a transportation fuel at the scope and scale required. The second observation relates to the heterogeneous levels of economic development witnessed throughout China. Some eastern regions of China have already entered a stage of economic development comparable to moderately-developed countries, presenting a gradually stabilized energy consumption trend the majority of the central and western regions are still undergoing extensive economic growth. These regions reflect the initial stages of industrialization focused on low-level construction/manufacturing, typical of patterns of earlier industrialization in the eastern areas of China. China’s energy consumption and energy-related CO2 emissions have different profiles depending on the region being examined demand could be expected to rise dramatically as standards of living rise in areas of low GDP per capita There are many key environmental impacts attributable to energy production and consumption, including anthropogenic climate change, particulate emissions and water pollution. Energy production and consumption have become one of the main reasons for environmental deterioration in China. haze has become the dominant environmental issue for the government, also the Chinese public    air pollution in China results from coal combustion, which is the source of 90% of SO2 emissions, 70% of dust emissions and 67% of NOx emissions . A coal-dominated energy structure is the major reason for this Anthropogenic global warming is perhaps the most important global issue of the 21st century nd nearly 72.5% of China’s total CO2 emissions were from coal in 2010 Coal will continue to dominate China’s energy consumption and production system in the foreseeable future, challenging the government in its pursuit of a greenhouse gas abatement policy in the short-to-medium term this makes China appear to be one of the main perpetrators of anthropogenic global warming Developing alternative energy will take time and investment to realize the benefits China’s use of coal for (cement and steel) is currently difficult to substitute for renewable alternatives , these key materials of development are almost unavoidable emitters China’s national energy policy has also plunged its renewable industrial development into a passive state fossil fuels will still be the main source for China’s energy consumption mix he EROI is less for these resources, and hence, the carbon footprint is also higher than more conventional hydrocarbon sources, making the emission problem even worse
The more important the military-industrial complex is within a country, the more likely it is that the nation state will act as a protector of its military rather than as a protector of the biosphere the military must be addressed as a cause and not a cure of global environmental problems.” Sooner or later the military-industrial complex must be dismantled. This is the sine qua non for effectively dealing with the entire global environmental crisis.” the UN’s Green Beret proposal could create environmental superpowers that profit from the military’s degradation of environment.   credibility is crucial when attempting to resolve disputes involving water allocation and trans-border pollution.
There are moments, even in highly polarized political times, when the center holds – and counts Three Republican centrists – the remnant of a once-robust moderate wing of their party – are poised to give Democrats the last few votes they need to pass President Obama’s $800 billion-plus stimulus plan It’s a bare working majority. But if the relationship develops, it allows the president to go forward largely without regard to majority conservative views in the GOP caucus. Democrats are shy of the 60 votes needed to move major legislation. That’s why Republican moderates like Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania are so crucial to the new president’s agenda
In a crisis the PLA could adopt a much higher intensity—and potentially very dangerous— approach to deterrence operations, such as by increasing the readiness level of its strategic missile force, displaying its nuclear, long-range conventional strike or anti-satellite weapons to send a deterrence signal or even conducting information attacks or limited conventional strikes designed to compel an adversary to submit to Chinese demands
elements within a social body begin to appeal to the ideas of a people, which then refers to a race, which then refers to a populations, and then is enshrined in the anodyne notion of “society.” the objects of scientific study are partly constituted by the disciplines that seek to study them. just as psychiatry produces the madman, and sexology the sexual deviant, and so on, political theory in conjunction with historical discourse, produces a people. As the political rationality of the modern state develops and grows in intensity, as it augments its claims to power, a people becomes a nation, becomes a population, becomes a biological phenomenon to be tended by all the sciences at the service of the state race also became the pivot around which the biopower state came to exert its claims, so as to be able to produce certain power effects political theory has to attend to the emergence of political rationality in terms not of its rationality, or claims to reason, but in terms of its modalities of operation reason is not the alibi of political rationality political rationality has to do with the horizon of its enactment there is no reason behind political power There is no power without the horizon of its enactment and the vehicles of its transmission. The effects produced by a certain way of organizing the social body, of studying it, of policing it, of taking care of it, of making sure that its health and protection are attended to in the most detailed and careful ways possible, produce a confrontation of forces that power is the power over life The political rationality of the modern state is above all a rationality grounded in the way it tends to the life of the population. The power of the biopolitical state is a regulation of life, a tending, a nurturing and management of the living. The political rationality of the modern total state is management of the living body of the people.
But that’s not because Beijing would intervene against the United States The notion that China is North Korea’s protector is badly out of date the Chinese do not want to see North Korea But President Xi Jinping’s support for maximum economic sanctions, including a de facto blockade of oil imports a classic act of war amounts to a change of sides when it comes to North Korean nuclear weapons Anybody who believes China would act on North Korea’s behalf in the event of an American attack against its nuclear installations has not been paying attention.
The report finds "no indication that the Cuban government provided weapons or paramilitary training to terrorist groups."   Cuba's inclusion on the list is not justified and reflects the views of members of Congress who are fiercely opposed to the communist leaders in Havana the State Department doesn't believe that Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism Cuba is clearly on the terrorist list for political reasons." But Havana has been reducing its support for the group and no longer provides it with travel documents, Cuba began hosting peace talks between the Colombian government and the rebels.   Cuba joined the Financial Action Task Force of South America, an intergovernmental group that seeks to enforce U.S.-supported standards on illicit activities. Cuba's shift reflects changes in the country's leadership and a preoccupation with domestic economic problems,
China would become a great power equal to the United States within 30 years The solution is to approach the US/China relationship not with competition but with co-operation Washington should have a thoughtful review of the implementation of the TRA and other outdated legislation an increasing number of American scholars and policy advisors have considered readjusting U.S. Taiwan policy as a result of the reducing gap in national strength between China and the U S as well as the growing prospects of their cooperation peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and the declining capacities of Taiwan the U S should get out of Taiwan affairs For people in favor of this perspective because of the narrowing gap between the U S and China and the expanding gap between the mainland and Taiwan Taiwan should not remain as an unstable root of tensions the game between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is over Taiwan cannot escape from the mainland's control cooperation between the U S and the mainland are more important than sentiments to Taiwan even if America continues to provide arms sales to Taiwan the island cannot defend itself Washington should gradually free itself from Taiwan affairs to avoid falling into a longtime hostility with a rising China the U S should review the arms sales issue if China continues to grow Taiwan seems doomed to become part of China at some point in the next decade or so it will become impossible for the U S to help Taiwan defend itself The price of close relations between the U S and Taiwan will overtake the interest America can gain the U S cannot maintain dominance in East Asia and commitment to Taiwan's security because of the decline of American national capacity and the growing need for U.S.-China strategic cooperation arms sales to Taiwan can only increase unnecessary hostility from the Chinese mainland Taiwan is less important than the mainland in U.S. policy reckoning peaceful unification is inherent within the U.S. policy guideline of peaceful resolution they consider Taiwan a strategic liability
By facilitating the adoption of better and more productive technologies and by fostering local learning and increasing local knowledge, college-educated workers positively affect the productivity and average wages of a city their departure from local workforces—due to limited visa channels or uncertain immigration status—could lower the productivity and wages of those left behind.
The Communist Party must bridge ideological divides that are driving a wedge between its factions eight ideological questions will be crucial to the direction of the country's development around the need to maintain the traditional communist ideology as the party tries to establish a capitalist-style market economy under the leadership of Xi Jinping who has launched both anti-corruption and ideological campaigns to "purify" the party to justify its sole rule reflected in the wrangle that two leading party publications Qiushi and the Study Times have engaged in over late leader chairman Mao Zedong's theory of class struggle debate highlighted dilemma the party had struggled with since the mainland embarked on market reforms At the core is the Communist Party's difficulty in re-establishing its legitimacy as political and economic conditions change," reflected deep divisions among party officials and scholars, disputes that could widen the party's internal gaps and create opposing political camps. It may also be conducive to redefining the party's very identity in the 21st century and lead to the transformation of the party [into one] that will become more politically open and tolerant While ideological emancipation is the final solution - and the dilemma will exist for some time - at least some compromise could be made to solve compelling issues in economic development rationally and efficiently,"
Some parents consciously choose to not have their children vaccinated, to delay vaccination, or to use alternative immunization schedules This has caused a resurgence of many infectious diseases due to the loss of herd immunity, which puts many communities at risk public health officials are increasingly fearful of the option for parents to claim exemptions from vaccination requirements exemptions are allowed d religious grounds in 48 states; and philosophical objections in 20 states.9,16 It has been estimated that 1% to 3% of children are excused from immunization because of these exemptions, but in some communities the exemption rate is as high as 20% Even when a low percentage of children are excused from immunization, the risk of disease outbreaks in schools with exemption rates as low as 2% to 4% increases. Illustratively, in southern Pennsylvania morbidity and mortality from preventable infectious diseases that are traced to many Amish parents’ decisions not to have their children immunized.9
US-China agreements are important in their own right, as they aim to prevent crises and defuse tensions between the two superpowers, but they may also serve as models for future military agreements, such as those that are currently being built between China and Japan for managing the Senkaku Islands dispute in the East China Sea. China and Japan initially agreed to pursue an East China Sea crisis mechanism in 2012, but got nowhere after tensions spiked over the Senkakus in September of that year. The fact that talks have resumed and progress is being made can only be a positive sign
Their struggle with the state is manifest in their ongoing debate and discussion around a membership law within their community My argument is that it is a sign, also, of colonialism’s ongoing existence Colonialism survives in a settler form
Although American leaders regularly denounce terrorism as the modern world’s greatest plague, most don’t see it as a major challenge We shouldn’t blow up terrorism into an existential threat. It’s not Obama agreed that ISIS and other groups stand no real chance of defeating the United States. “Today’s terrorists can kill innocent people,” Obama stated, “but they don’t pose an existential threat to our nation.” Instead, officials have grown more concerned about other challenges.
How did Congress give up drilling on land and instead head dozens of miles into the Arctic Ocean to hunt for oil In far northern Alaska, there are no deepwater ports, no nearby pipelines to those offshore oil prospects, no fully staffed offices for regulators to keep watch nothing resembling the oil-spill response infrastructure you’d find elsewhere on state land there is a maze of infrastructure, along with a 40-year-plus history of managing onshore oil development There was a time when drilling on ANWR’s coastal plain was among the biggest environmental debates of our time the caribou that migrate where onshore drilling is currently taking place to the west have not seemed to be hurting ANWR sits on solid ground where an oil spill would be comparatively easy to handle than out at sea a spill in the Arctic Ocean would be a devastating mess,
At the heart of the debate around neoliberalism in environmental governance is the balance between the state and the market and the rise of the market in the last few decades shows just how powerful it has become through the processes of deregulation and globalisation. Neoliberal capitalism is a system of booms and busts and despite its creation of crises, it has an astounding capacity to turn around and profit from them, (Klein, XXXX). With regards to the environmental crisis and climate change, this is still to be seen but is argued, as above, that the commodification of nature will again be an example of neoliberalism's dynamic capacity to manage crisis. This anthropocentric translation of nature is purportedly more efficient, encouraging of innovation and more costeffective than traditional regulation, (Jordan et al, 2003). As decision-making within all other areas of governance are also heavily weighted by economics, Therefore, going green will succeed - as with all things in the market - if it is profitable.

Of course, they should. But can they? Since 2001 China has defined almost any dissent from its policies there as examples of international terrorism. It has consistently tried to win western acquiescence in its suppression of the Uighurs China’s propaganda has identified a group it calls the ETIM as a main instigator of Uighur violence in China
the Supreme Court made integration even more difficult than it already was decreed that student categorization by race ) is unconstitutional unless it is designed to reverse effects of explicit rules that segregated students by race It is generally accepted today, even by sophisticated policymakers, that black students’ racial isolation is now de facto, with no constitutional remedy— Breyer argued that school districts should be permitted voluntarily to address de facto racial homogeneity, even if not constitutionally required to do so. But he accepted that for the most part, Louisville and Seattle schools were not segregated by state action and thus not constitutionally required to desegregat residential segregation’s causes are both knowable and known federal, state and local policies explicitly designed to separate the races and whose effects endure today. In any meaningful sense, neighborhoods and in consequence, schools, have been segregated de jure. The notion of de facto segregation is a myth, although widely accepted in a national consensus that wants to avoid confronting our racial history. The federal government led in the establishment and maintenance of residential segregation Roosevelt’s first public housing director This was de jure segregation

Feminists in IR have consistently claimed the gender lenses offer a unique understanding feminist arguments for ‘first-image’ significance do not rely on inte­grating women into leadership. feminists have understood accounts of human nature that disregard gender as incomplete gender affects first-image scholars’ choice of subject feminists provide a link between ‘people’ and ‘the system’ that understands the international system as interdependent first question of the role of human nature in global politics work in feminist IR argue that gender analy-sis matters in the study of global politics. Tickner argued that the pessimist view of human nature was ‘rooted in assumption associated with masculinity Feminists observe that realists’ conceptions of human nature privilege the side of these dichotomies associated with masculinity discounting the characteristics associated with femininity Tickner explains that a concept of human nature that privileges traits associated with masculinity only tells a partial story: A feminist perspective believes that objective’ laws of human nature are based on a masculine view Human nature is both masculine and feminine liberal approaches to gender are left to ‘roam confusedly juggling with incoherent strategies which simultaneously assert women’s sameness to and difference from men Rejecting both negative and individualistic approaches to human nature feminist theorists have drawn alternative visions Tickner proposes a hybrid approach that sees human nature as a combination of characteristics traditionally associated with masculinity and the characteristics associated with femininity see human behavior as fluidly connected to gendered) social norms rather than stabilized by nature
From the Cold War era until recently, most major defense-related technologies were first developed by government programs and later spread to the commercial sector Examples include nuclear technology, the Global Positioning System (GPS), and the internet In contrast civilian companies are leading AI with DOD adapting their tools after the fact for national security functions It is unusual to have a technology that is so important being developed commercially
the rate of warming at the Earth’s surface was slower than scientists expected, despite the continued accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. Recent research has shown that natural fluctuations in the Pacific Ocean played an important role in this surface warming “slowdown”. a new paper, published in Nature Climate Change, suggests these variations in the Pacific Ocean were actually triggered by changing aerosol emissions from human activity particularly by increases in China’s burning of fossil fuels. the slowdown in surface warming could have been predicted and that future cuts to aerosol emissions could prompt rapid warming in the coming years. the IPCC calculated that global surface temperatures rose 30-50% slower than the 0.12C per decade increase over the longer period of 1951-2012. Aerosols tend to have a cooling effect on the Earth’s climate, by scattering incoming sunlight and by stimulating clouds to form, preventing the Sun’s energy reaching Earth’s surface. The changing concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere caused local cooling over China and warming over Europe, North America, and, hence, the North Atlantic, Smith says Using climate models, the researchers found they could recreate the negative PDO – and the surface warming slowdown – by simulating these changes in human aerosol emissions. we may add another possible factor to the list of processes that have been identified as contributing to the early-2000s slowdown, and all likely played a role: internal [Pacific Ocean] variability, a succession of moderate-sized volcanic eruptions, an extended solar minimum around 2012, stratospheric water vapor, and now anthropogenic aerosols.”
Senator Paul’s focus on the substantive validity and wisdom of the phone records program has obscured larger problems Paul’s grandstanding on the call records program may well come to epitomize what I’ve elsewhere described as “libertarian hijacking,” “wherein libertarians form a short-term coalition with progressive Democrats on national security issues, only to pack up and basically go home once they have extracted concessions such efforts . . . consume most (if not all) of the available oxygen and political capital
people accept the acts of courts - even when those acts augment or arguably conflict with the foundational text. In a newly formed political society, any apparent deviation from the words of a constitution might be seen as revolutionary in a mature society, relationships and patterns of trust are so well developed that that does not happen. A supermajority might act, and adopt an amendment, even if society has not fundamentally changed. An amendment might represent an effective effort by an interest group At a later time, many people, even a majority, might decide that the amendment was a mistake - but there it is, entrenched in the Constitution On these occasions the formal amendment will be relatively insignificant When there is no lasting social consensus behind a textual amendment, the change in the text of the Constitution is unlikely to make a lasting difference the amendment is likely to be evaded, or interpreted in a way that blunts its effectiveness a mature society has a variety of institutions, in addition to the text of the Constitution, that can affect how the society operates. Those institutions can change society without changing the Constitution;
one of the prerequisites for something to be defined as a game or the act of playing is that the player voluntary participates in it Play is necessarily an act and expression of the player’s free will and he must not be forced into the act of playing play must be defined as a free and voluntary activity player devotes himself spontaneously to the game, of his free will and for its pleasure, each time completely free to choose retreat, silence, meditation, idle solitude or creative activity Marxist dialectics should be seen as play versus work games are primarily autotelic; that is, they are mostly used for their own sake rather than for an external purpose capitalism is based on the illusion that a worker voluntary enters an employment in an enterprise owned by a capitalist to earn her living One major reason for Caillois’ attempts to keep ‘‘forced’’ gaming at bay is the productivity of play/game the unproductiveness of games also needs to be understood from the perspective of Marxist dialectics unproductiveness of games is the opposite of the forced labor of the working class producing goods for the capitalist Games do not in themselves produce anything material in contrast to work only plays when in the full meaning of the word he is a man, and he is only completely a man when he plays in industrialized societies, enjoyment becomes separated from labor, and it is upon this that Marx based his analysis of capitalist production all except play is depriving man from being man and the free will to play lies at the essence of man as a social being, making man completely a man play is the sole remaining escape from the suppressing bourgeoisie Play/game produces no wealth or goods, ‘‘thus differing from work and art’’ the activity of play is for the player’s own pleasure It is the player alone that out of her own free will enters the separate space and time of play Separate from everyday work, separate from the production tools owned not by the worker but by the employer, the capitalist The act of playing is in essence a means for the worker to cease being a worker, for a limited time, and to become, in a surrealist sense, ‘‘something else’’ than a slave in the bounds of the capitalist The player still needs to adhere and acquiesce to the rules of play that lie within the act of playing Playing games is therefore to be understood as a voluntary activity in which the worker who becomes a player can throw off the bounds of capitalism and be her own master by mastering the game she engages with Playing games voluntarily could be viewed as the antidote needed in order for the worker to develop freely her physical and mental energy and not to mortify her body and the ruination of her mind
Russia is steadily building up its stake in the oil industry of Venezuela Rosneft, declared last month the oil-rich South American country would be the main focus of Rosneft’s overseas investments Russia will commit to invest up to 40 billion in jointly exploiting the Orinoco extra-heavy oil belt Venezuela relies heavily on its oil exports, which supply 95 per cent of its foreign earnings.
subjectivity and taking personal agency to create imagined worlds where Black people are leaders is a strong challenge to the weakened but still existing stereotypes of Black women and men as non-intellectual or limited in technological knowledge African-American critical theory provides very sophisticated tools for the analysis of cyberculture Stereotypes regarding Black women and intellectual abilities continue to be extremely difficult to unravel Black feminists have persisted in creating fissures in these “bodies” of “knowledge” in order to question and unravel these stereotypes, while opening possibilities for critical inquiry that would traverse new terrain in Africana women’s speculative/science fiction. “Black women’s existence, experience, and culture and the brutally complex systems of oppression which shape these in the in `real world’ of white and/or male consciousness beneath consideration, invisible, unknown” Black women struggled to be heard and acknowledged as contributors to literary traditions, and as “outsiders,” were subject to marginalization in academic discourse. Black feminists furthered the call for theory through series of reshaping and reimagining European theoretical apparatuses in order to use the Master’s Tools to dismantle the Master’s “House,” which could be considered as signified through imposition of “theoretical discourse.” “black holes may give access to other dimensions…and object …enters the black hole and is infinitely compressed to zero volume…it passes through to another dimension, whereupon the object…reassumes…all of the properties of visibility and concreteness, but in another dimension” The trope of the black hole described the dimensions of negation, and described the repressed accumulation of black feminist creativity as compressed mass, negated from existence in the race and production of theory “The outsider sees black feminist creativity as a hole from which nothing worthwhile can emerge and in which everything is forced to assume the zero volume of nothingness, the invisibility, that results from the intense pressure of race, class and sex” Through the margin of resistance black women writers encourage others to write, to create works of art, and to break through the “black hole”. Contemporary black women writers linked subjectivity with emotional and spiritual health, ignoring the possibility of commitment to radical politics and the possibility of resisting unity concepts and accepting difference in female experience and in subjectivity itself, reinforcing dominant feminist thought and essentialist notions of black identity the margin was a position of political possibility and a space of resistance, and a location of counter-hegemonic discourse which also came from lived experience Black women writers have possibilities of multiple locations of expression. When black women as “other” speaks and writes in resistance, she is no longer a silent object of derision or object of degradation; she is a radical subject of resistance. As a speaking “other” she is not the muted other, but a subject of power, power which is used to deconstruct the structures of oppression. Henderson suggested the development of “an enabling critical fiction–that it is black women writers who are the modern-day apostles, empowered by experience to speak as poets and prophets in many tongues….signify[ing] a deliberate intervention by black women writers into the canonic tradition of sacred/literary texts” the conditions which continue to make an appeal to experience as a logical, appealing, and invisible foundation themselves constitute the most powerful argument for the continued need for “black feminist critics” to organize and inventively challenge the apparatus and terms of their representation Spillers asserted a need for Black feminists to pursue a discursive strategy to correct “official” histories of Black female sexuality that would reposition us as a disruptive force to counter hegemonic influence:  feminists are called upon to initiate a corrected and revised view of women of color on the frontiers of symbolic action” The rise of Afrofuturism in the 21st century, can be considered as an aesthetic and critical process existing at the side of and through the development of Black feminism and its critical companion intersectionality. [s]peculative fiction is a way of expanding our ideas of what human nature really is, allowing us to consider all aspects of ourselves Afrofuturists invoke the past as a means towards imagining a future that is not only inclusive of us as participants but as shapers of worlds that embrace new permutations of existence, “Afrofuturism as a movement itself may be the first in which black women creators are credited for the power of their imaginations and are equally represented as the face of the future and the shapers of the future” “Afrofuturism has evolved into a coherent mode not only aesthetically but also in terms of its political mission. In its broadest dimensions Afrofuturism is an extension of the historical recovery projects that black Atlantic intellectuals have engaged in for well over two hundred years” Afrofuturism is also a reclaiming of space previously assumed to be alien to us; it is not so much about being included in someone else’s cultural and technological conversation, as it is a reclaiming of authority to speak as creators and inventors. For Black feminists, such a process surpasses socio-cultural codes demanding containment. “While Afrofuturist women are obviously shaped by modern gender issues, their creations and theories themselves emerge from a space that renders such limitations moot” This process intervenes and interrupts what Alondra Nelson refers to as “the racialized digital divide narrative” that circulates in the public sphere and the bodiless, color-blind mythotopias of cybertheory In these frameworks, the technologically enabled future is by its very nature unmoored from the past and from people of color. Racialized tropes that dominate the “public sphere” have been flooded with the notion that a digitalized or highly technological space cannot exist or flourish in a future populated with people of color because they/we are outdated, or of a past existence. Cultural expressions coming from such ideological paradigms assume a future free of those populations that signify a racialized limitation a futurist vision counters the hegemony’s script: Reed’s depiction of “technology” serves as a subversion of the dominant tropes by revising and reimagining stories of both our past and our future from a vantage point of one who is able to see our presence as both inventors and users of technology. speculation in fiction offers Afrofuturist writers a means towards “shaking up” the hegemony: “Science fiction and fantasy are already about subverting paradigms African American writers who have ventured into speculative fiction featuring horror or the fantastic engage in a counter-text or counter-theoretical mode of writing about the past, where the “horror” of the slave institution, Jim Crow, and the aftermath provide rich, fertile ground upon which to imagine supernatural or preternatural figures who exist in a world already rife with evils of racism, subjugation, and dehumanization.  Afrofuturism is a process that disrupts and erupts commonly understood sequential order of things, or what we have understood to be history, or even fact.  the speculative possesses a political vehicle that allows writers to explore racial and social class performativity: “So one might say that, at a very deep level, one of the things that fantasy and science fiction do is to use myth-making to examine and explore socioeconomically configured ethnoracial power imbalances” Afrofuturism positions the master narrative about the past, present, and future into one of instability and uncertainty, which is, a critical and political strategy that can align and inform with that of a Black feminist process that seeks to develop a discursive strategy that complicates and disrupts those narratives and myths that depend on a singularity of timelines or identity politics. Afrofuturism and Black feminism are both vital critical apparatus vehicles for Afro-Diasporic women and men who seek to enter and disrupt an otherwise homogenous ideological framework.
Gun control advocates hyperventilating over Trump’s nomination of Kavanaugh Gun control advocates are most upset by 2011 dissent in which Kavanaugh voted to strike down Washington, D.C.’s ban But it's easy to read too much into any one case, especially when a judge is simply following precedent set by the Supreme Court As a lower court, however, it is not our role to re-litigate Heller or to bend it in any particular direction,” Kavanaugh wrote It's not as though Kavanaugh took a particularly strong self-defense rights view of Supreme Court precedent: “Heller largely preserved the status quo of gun regulation in the United States. Heller established that traditional and common gun laws in the United States remain constitutionally permissible.” Bloomberg’s Everytown is also simply wrong when it says that Kavanaugh “does not take into account a law’s impact on public safety.” For example, on his dissent, Kavanaugh compares the safety issues for semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles. Kavanaugh notes of the D.C. law: "It bans certain semi-automatic rifles but not others — with no particular explanation or rationale for why some made the list and some did not. The list appears to be haphazard." Kavanaugh is hardly the wide-eyed radical gun control advocates paint him to be. He believes that “regulations on the sale, possession, or use of guns are permissible” and that the Heller decision “largely preserved the status quo of gun regulation in the United States.”
Although modern investment clauses and investor-state dispute resolution have been with us since the 1950s, resort to them was limited during their first 50 years when only fifty investor-state claims were filed . In contrast, since 2001, four hundred investor-state disputes have been filed Investors have won nearly $3 billion from taxpayers in arbitral awards and another $15 billion in claims is pending under U.S. FTAs and BITs alone This sea change in investor-state claims occurred because investors belatedly realized that not only could they bring claims against banana-republic confiscations but against emerging economies and even advanced democracies whenever their unrequited expectations of profits were thwarted by government regulations foreign corporations have used investor-state dispute resolution to challenge a broad array of environmental and land use laws, government procurement decisions, regulatory permitting, financial regulations, consumer protection, public health, and public safety laws, and a range of other public interest policies.
Life in the oceans faces large-scale extinctions Three of the five largest extinctions of the past 500 million years were associated with global warming and acidification of the oceans -- trends which also apply today the Earth is in a period of increased extinction risks mainly caused by human factors sea life is resilient But also that it can take millions of years to do so the oceans aren't just a big dumping ground for human waste, contaminants and CO2 They are closely linked to our own survival, as well as that of life on Earth in general The situation is not hopeless sea life can bounce back, given a chance to do so. we need to stop releasing the CO2 that drives these massive extinction events
President Obama announced a new executive order to expand protected marine waters Tuesday, making it the second executive order this week Obama introduced Tuesday a proposal that could create the largest sanctuary for marine life in the world and double the area of ocean that is protected globally. Under the proposal, a large expanse of the central Pacific Ocean will become a protected national monument and off limits to fishing. According to two analyses obtained by the Washington Post, The Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument would be expanded from 87,000 square miles to about 782,000 square miles. If all goes according to plan, the proposal will go into effect later this year Tuesday's announcement is Obama’s first executive order that places protections on marine waters. It will be added to the list of 11 other executive orders he enacted since his presidency began that protect areas of land.
The best approach is to eliminate the region system from the diversity lottery entirely Countries don't immigrate. People do A Mexican individual without family or business ties in the United States has exactly the same immigration prospects as an Irish individual without family or business ties in the United States The only way to truly level the playing field for all would-be "independent" immigrants is to abandon the region system entirely. perpetuating the effects of such a discriminatory system should not be an objective of U.S. immigration policy. Only by creating a truly equal playing field, without respect to borders, can the United States send the clear message that its immigration policy truly values individuals (and diversity) without regard to race or national origin only acceptable approach to independent immigration is one that does not discriminate at any level. If after enactment, the program is determined to not enhance diversity, then a random lottery first-come, first-serve system should be immediately implemented." best system for admitting independent immigrants and increasing true diversity (cultural, geographic, economic, and racial) is a random lottery where the only qualification is a desire to live in "The Land of the Free." A random world-wide lottery would allocate visas to the geographic areas with the greatest demand. formal equality of treatment for countries obviously does not mean equality of opportunity for individuals, sin —a person's chance of being issued a visa, or the length of time he must wait for one, varies greatly depending on the demand in his country. the current lottery system, whose highly formalized treatment of countries and regions clearly "does not mean equality of opportunity for individuals. that a random lottery would do a better job of distributing visas to currently underserved regions than the current lottery. If Africa, Europe, and South America, for example, all have a similar number of individuals desiring to immigrate to the United States, a random lottery will ensure that, on average, each of these regions will receive an equal allotment of lottery visas. a random lottery eliminates any discrepancies in the region definitions—for example, by assigning Middle Eastern countries to three different regions. random lottery focuses on the individual. By considering each applicant without regard to race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, age, primary language, or any other artificial criterion, only a random world-wide lottery can provide a truly equitable system of independent immigration.
The attempt to provide a genuinely non-anthropocentric set of values, or preferences seems to be a hopeless quest Once we eschew all human values, interests and preferences we are confronted with just too many altematives non-anthropocentric bases permit too many different possibilities not all of which are at all congenial to us We should be concerned to promote a rich, diverse and vibrant biosphere preoccupations of deep ecology as a result of human activities are possible only if we assume a set of values based on human preferences. We need to reject not anthropocentrism, but a particularly short term and narrow conception of human interests and concerns What's wrong with shallow views is that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. We need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception. There is every reason for us to try to keep it, and ourselves, going for a few more cosmic seconds.
Fenner says homo sapiens will not be able to survive the population explosion and “unbridled consumption,” and will become extinct, perhaps within a century, along with many other species
. A critical reading of the Haitian Revolution, must take into account the a priori, transcendental determinants that allow for the taking place of such processes of subjection and exploitation, the becoming-minoritarian and becoming other, the subtractive politics of constituting other worlds Deleuze offers theoretical tools for escape from the various prison-houses of modern subjectivity of which race and colonialism are to be counted among the most vicious and dehumanising the half-million former slaves creating a ‘war machine’ in the precise sense Deleuze and Guattari give to the term through the violent destruction of the striated, regimented space of domination and the creation of novel lines of maroon fight through a suddenly smooth space Toussaint instituted, a destructive Kantian practice of dissidence, one in which , law no longer has its foundation in some higher principle from which it would derive its authority, but that is self-grounded and valid solely by virtue of its own form we can now speak of THE LAW, regarded as an absolute, without further specification or reference to an object a Deleuzian critique of race and colonial exploitation would work to escape from the logic of identity and identification with one’s political and existential subjection at the heart of modernity. Deleuze’s critique of identity addresses the common distribution of beings according to categories and hierarchies, and the cognitive judgment of the propriety of any distribution or attribution of identity ‘difference is in effect fully subject to the identity of the concept, the opposition of predicates, the analogy of judgment and the resemblance of perception think identity not as illusory attribution but rather as the repetition of pure difference, to think the singularity of any entity in terms of its protean powers of transformation Deleuze envisages not only or even principally the transformation of any determinate being as a subtraction from actualised identities . Disidentification aiming at no less than the radical reformulation of the transcendental operators governing any world. The importance of the Haitian Revolution lies in its transcendence of any identity-based politics to politicise instead the Idea of the universal human right to be free from enslavement. This Idea universal emancipation, the idea of the Haitian Revolution, preconscious, independent of its representation under the aegis of a reflexive cogito The Idea of the Haitian Revolution as the pure multiplicity of a swarming war machine was arguably first actualised as a disembodied claim of absolute equality The call for libete sparked a non-localisable chain of connections within an anonymous, enslaved multitude that enjoyed no place in their post-1789 world. Libete’s multiplicity linked up to a series of adjunct fields that further informed this pure Idea and moved to operate a actualisation of the singular nature of their claim On the night of 29 August 1791, a massive uprising of some half-million slaves first began to actualise this pre-individual idea as a complex, unfolding differenctiation of relationships and elements The idea of universal emancipation was at first only a pure problem but quickly became the struggle to instantiate a real solution to that problem. To think with Deleuze the destruction of racial identity, of law, of subjection, and to trace and follow through the immanent lines of flight is to unfold the extraordinary potentiality of any pure differenctiation and becoming beyond the actual state of our human, all-too human, racialised being.
sexual health promotion in schools must include the teachers who will deliver programs the SHARE program collaborated with a respected sex education expert known to teachers all teachers who delivered SHARE were provided with a 5-day course on how to deliver the program. During this course part-time teachers covered their other duties. Teachers’ evaluation of this training was overwhelmingly positive and the course was particularly successful at boosting the confidence of teachers despite apparently successful training, some teachers remained reluctant to deliver key aspects of the program. For example, although the importance of student participation and the development of student self-efficacy had been emphasized, some teachers substituted a demonstration of how to use a condom for the student practice prescribed by the program Many teachers also remained uncertain about managing role-play exercises key activities, such as condom demonstrations and roleplay exercises on sexual issues, are especially challenging for classroom teachers, probably because of a fear of losing control over their students.
We are taugh that competition is good, greed is good Competition nables the best and brightest to rise to the top. W Ecosystems survive through mutually beneficial cooperation not competition. If nature was based solely on competition, there would only be one survivor at the top of each food chain niche instead of the 30 million species alive today. It is physically impossible to have concentration of resources, material or financial, without war here will always be a winner and loser, someone at the top and many at the bottom. . If you cannot make it from local sunlight, you have to exploit and concentrate or take from somewhere else Globalization is War War also comes in the form of colonization, occupation and corporation Globalization is now a common form of low-level warfare. When the IMF and World Bank make loans, it forces the small third world countries to open their markets and sell their natural resources in order to pay the loans. Local farmers who had saved seeds for centuries are forced to go deeply into debt and buy seed and other inputs from Monsanto. Diversity in the food varieties we eat has disappeared. Free trade agreements enable large producers to leverage their size to put local farmers, manufacturers and merchants, out of business. vilization has also waged a 10,000 year war on nature one species is responsible for the single largest mass extinction
May 9, 2013 — the day the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million for the first time in recorded history will be seen as the long-anticipated tipping point at which human impacts caused irrevocable harm to our planet. when a tipping point is passed, change is rapid, uncontrolled and often irreversible. Passing a tipping point is like crossing a threshold from one room to another and having the door triple-locked behind you; the state of the world after the tipping point is very different from the state of the world before the tipping point, and it is very difficult to go back. tipping point presages a change in regime. And the prime example of a tipping point in the natural world is, many feel, climate change the deciduous forests of the northern hemisphere that provide New England with spectacular colors every fall will inhale some of that CO2 as they leaf out every spring, those great “lungs of the planet” cannot keep the CO2 in the atmosphere below 400 ppm. even if an all-powerful deity were to manage to convince us to stop burning of all fossil fuels today, the “inertia” in the climate system would ensure that the Earth’s temperature would keep increasing and sea levels would continue to rise  The inexorable warming of the planet caused by an ever-denser blanket of CO2 above us is not a fad we passed a tipping point and entered a new world.
The prime victim of the economic blockade has unquestionably been the Cuban people. The blockade affects the Cuban population without regard to sex, age, race, religion, political creed, or social position, not only because it attacks basic means of living but also because it undermines the possibility of intellectual development and the spiritual well-being of the Cuban family. we shall focus on three important aspects of the Cuban blockade: the food supply, health, and the negative consequences felt by women in Cuba. we have often relied on quantifying the most tangible effects from an economic perspective it has not been possible to evoke the full effect of the havoc wrought by each of the factors Moreover, the toll in terms of human suffering cannot be quantified and consequently we shall allow the historic events themselves to bear witness to what has transpired
The CBO’s latest estimate on the real-world effect of the AHCA finds that 23 million Americans would lose their health coverage by 2026. This estimate is due in large part because this bill decimates Medicaid, which helps children, seniors, and the disabled access health coverage. These cuts total an almost incomprehensible $834 billion and would force states to cut Medicaid benefits, cut enrollment in the program, or both. No state’s Medicaid program would be spared, and access to health care would be jeopardized for millions of people. Medicaid has essentially guaranteed that our most vulnerable have access to health coverage, and that need hasn’t changed today. Medicaid, making the program the nation’s largest single source of health coverage. This program is a literal lifeline The AHCA repeals every cent of federal funding for Medicaid expansion, ensuring that everyone who gained Medicaid through this pathway will lose coverage, and states that expanded the program will be left holding the bag. Medicaid expansion programs have provided access to health coverage for three million low-income Latino adults in the 31 states, plus DC, that have chosen to expand their programs. This has not only enabled millions of previously uninsured adults to access coverage, but has transformed state economies in the process. States that have enacted Medicaid expansion have realized budget savings, revenue gains, and overall economic growth. Medicaid cuts harm our health, our economy, and our children’s future. This bill cuts access to health care for millions and decimates state budgets just to fund tax cuts for the wealthy.
prospects for passing comprehensive immigration reform dwindle in the House House and its leadership is showing a tremendous lack of leadership,” said Grijalva Boehner is not talking about a bipartisan bill that’s comprehensive, Boehner is not talking about bringing something to the floor so that the House can work its will,” Republican leaders hoped to move forward with a variety of small bills dealing with certain aspects of immigration, but not a comprehensive package like the one the Senate passed GOP has yet to figure out its position on the legal status of the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S.
Why should Americans care if their country is no longer recognized as the most powerful and influential player in a region that is, after all, half a world away The reasons for this have always involved a combination of economic, strategic, and ideological considerations. If Western Europe or East Asia were to fall under the sway of by unfriendly forces, the United States could find itself denied access to markets, technology, and vital resources. A hostile power or coalition might be able to draw on the wealth and military capabilities of the region under its control, using it as a secure base from which to challenge American interests and perhaps even to attack the United States itself. If through inadvertence, error, or deliberate decision we permit China as presently constituted to dominate Asia, our prosperity, security, and hopes of promoting the further spread of freedom will be seriously impaired Our businesses could find their access to the markets, high-technology products, and natural resources of some of the world's most dynamic economies constricted by trade arrangements designed to favor their Chinese counterparts. an unchecked China would be well situated to enforce claims over resources and territory that are currently disputed by its weaker neighbors Control over the vast oil and gas reserves believed to lie beneath the South and East China Seas, plus assured access on favorable terms to energy imports from Central Asia and Russia, could greatly reduce Beijing's dependence on seaborne imports from the Persian Gulf and hence its vulnerability to a possible American (or Indian) naval blockade. With the United States gone from East Asia, China would be able to bring Taiwan to terms, and it would most likely be able to block, neutralize, or preempt the emergence of serious military challenges from Japan or South Korea , Beijing would be able to devote more resources to setting terms with its continental neighbors and it would be able to more easily project military power to defend or advance its interests in other parts of the world If Asia comes to be dominated by an authoritarian China, the prospects for liberal reform in any of its non-democratic neighbors will be greatly diminished. Even the region's established democracies could find themselves inhibited from pursuing policies, foreign and perhaps domestic as well, that might incur Beijing's wrath. China would also be able to more effectively support nondemocratic regimes in other parts of the world and to present some variant of its own internal arrangements as a viable alternative to the liberal democratic capitalism of the West.
Critics of sweatshops frequently ground their protests in appeals to human dignity and human rights. Kantian ethics provides a philosophical basis for such moral pronouncements. The key principle here is the categorical imperative: "Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only." morality requires that we respect people One significant feature of respect for persons is derivation and application can be assessed independently of other elements of Kantian moral philosophy. Sympathetic readers need not embrace all aspects of Kant's system of ethics in order to grant the merit of Kant's arguments for the second formulation of the categorical imperative This is because Kant's defense of respect for persons is grounded in the uncontroversial claim that humans are capable of rational, self-governing activity individuals with a wide range of theoretical commitments can and should recognize the force of Kant's arguments concerning respect for persons Persons ought to be respected because persons have dignity. For Kant, an object that has dignity is beyond price. Employees have a dignity that machines and capital do not have As free beings capable of self governance they are responsible beings, since freedom and self-governance are the conditions for responsibility. Autonomous responsible beings are capable of making and following their own laws   the fact that one is a moral being entails that one possesses dignity.
North Korea’s provocations have prompted critical changes in alliance priorities particularly in the area of BMD, and have played a forceful role in driving Japan’s security policy, pushing Japanese public to accept, a more forward-leaning defense posture. North Korea’s 1998 test of its first multistage rocket over Japan consolidated support for BMD cooperation with the United States North Korea had abducted several Japanese citizens shocked the Japanese public and led to popular support for a hardline stance on North Korea North Korea’s behavior—repeated missile launches, six tests of nuclear devices spurred Japanese leaders to pursue more robust missile defense cooperation with the United States. Japanese territory is well within the range of North Korean Nodong ballistic missiles, which are potentially capable of delivering a nuclear warhead Japan would be a target of North Korean missile attacks in a major crisis situation Abe also supported Trump’s “all options on the table” approach, suggesting that Japan would support the use of military force against North Korea

As explained in the Introduction, in a 2013 article I analyzed how a preference for local control and a limited federal role in education have functioned as one of several critical roadblocks to three of the primary reforms that promote equal educational opportunity: school desegregation, school finance litigation in federal court, and NCLB.' For instance, key Supreme Court decisions, from the 1974 decision in Milliken v. Bradley to the 1995 decision in Missouri v. Jenkins, relied on the structure of federalism and the American tradition of local control of education as one of the reasons for severely curtailing the authority of courts to ensure effective school desegregation.1 0 2 In so doing, these opinions clung to a form of dual federalism that required separate spheres for certain government functions, and thus insisted that education was solely a state and local function. Similarly, the Supreme Court relied upon education federalism as one of several justifications for rejecting a federal right to education in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez.05 The Court noted that it lacked the expertise to interfere with state and local education judgments regarding the most effective education reforms and the connection between funding and educational quality.' 06 The Court's rationale also highlighted the importance of local control of schools and the values it brings, such as tailoring programs to students' needs and experimentation.' 07 The Court insisted that it did not want to disturb the existing balance of power between the federal and state governments by reaching a decision that essentially would result in striking down school finance systems throughout the United States. 08 Thus, the Court's decision privileged federalism interests over the nation's interest in equal educational opportunity and insulated school finance disparities from federal judicial review.'09
Venezuela has taken positions on proliferation issues that run directly against the mainstream of international public opinion pursuing a potential nuclear supplier It has also opposed international sanctions over nuclear issues on both powers. Venezuela‟s stated concern of a U.S. invasion has led it to officially orient its Armed Forces towards a policy of prolonged popular war and asymmetric warfare. This has translated into changes in doctrine and the creation of a militia. nuclear forces would be the ultimate deterrent against outside intervention. these factors have led some outside observers to claim that Venezuela is a potential nuclear proliferation risk. Argentina and Brazil have reacted very cautiously to the Venezuelan nuclear proposal. they are concerned about Chávez‟s ambitions. neither the Argentine nor the Brazilian governments have opposed Venezuela‟s nuclear ambitions publicly because they are vulnerable domestically on their left flank
it is also easy to overstate what Russia is offering to Egypt. Russia's loans, which Egypt must repay, are not substitutes for U.S. grant assistance, and Russia is not in the same position as the United States to facilitate Egypt’s entrée into European capitals and international financial institutions. What Egypt needs is private investment and lots of it—not what Putin can provide it is not easy to switch military operating systems on a dime, especially after four decades of Egypt relying on American equipment and training in all areas except for missile defense. Putin has not been as unconditionally supportive of Sisi as some would suggest, nor has Sisi welcomed all of Putin’s overtures. Putin is holding out on restoring all Russian commercial flights to Egypt if the U.S.-Egyptian military relationship did fall apart for whatever reason, and Sisi sought to compensate by openly allying with Russia on a practical level, the impact on U.S. interests would be much less than it once would have been. Due to years of internal erosion of the Egyptian state, it is a less capable regional actor than it was several decades ago and its military is a poor reflection of the force that acquitted itself well in 1973 Excepting Libya, Egypt has been unwilling to deploy its forces abroad. Power in the region has shifted to the Gulf, as economic influence has become increasingly important, while other Arab and North African countries have come to eclipse Egypt in areas such as human development Egypt would most likely continue to allow U.S. ships access to the Suez Canal, for which the U.S. Navy pays handsomely. Egypt might deny overflight and landing rights to U.S. military aircraft, but those are much less valuable than they once were as the United States continues to entrench its position in Qatar. The real danger for the United States is not that it might lose Egypt, but that this nation of nearly one hundred million could sink into obscurity or even state failure due to poor governance, rapid population growth, and economic fragility
The 911 emergency response system, a specialized communications network that relies on local telephone service, is a favorite target for theorists of cyber-terrorism, but like other infrastructures, it is a robust target. The U.S. does not use a single 911 system but instead has several thousand local systems using different technologies and procedures. No 911 system in a major city has been hacked.
information technologies are profoundly political instruments implicated in the fortification of external borders of the Western world coupled with biometric technologies, the various systems in use for regulating border traffic, border patrol, immigration, and asylum policy establish forms of identity politics that transform geographical borders into lived and embodied identities specifically in Europe, one traditional way to enter the first world legally, the application for political asylum, is gradually blocked, leaving many refugees little option but to join the ranks of the criminalized “illegal aliens,” the use of information technologies and biometrics are inscribing identities on bodies information technologies, and biometrics in particular, constitute increased levels of surveillance for both Western citizens and non-Western immigrants, refugees, and visitors in ways that more often than not are practically immune to democratic controls.
Racial oppression works on multiple axes with color being the most dominant and currently most pernicious. color is not exhaustive of all the forms racial oppression can take. The most pejorative terms used against Asian Americans often have a racial connotation but without a color connotation These terms denigrate a whole people, not a particular set of customs or a specific history, and thus parallel the essentializing move of racist discourse that universalizes negative value across a group that is demarcated on the basis of visible features. these terms demonstrate the possibility of a racialization and racism that works through constructing and then denigrating other racialized features and characteristics besides color. We might think of these as two independent axes of racialization that operate through physical features other than color, and through genealogies of cultural origin. The discrimination against Asian Americans and Latino/as has also operated very strongly on a fourth axis of “nativism.” Nativism is a prejudice against immigrants On this view, the problem with Asian Americans and Latino/as is not just that they are seen as foreign; they are seen as ineluctably foreign, from inferior cultures incapable of and unmotivated toward assimilation to the superior mainstream white Anglo culture. They want to keep their languages, demand instruction in public schools in their primary languages, and they often maintain their own holidays, cuisines, religions, and living areas This “xenophobia directed within” has been especially virulent at specific times in U.S. history, during and after both world wars for example, and is enjoying a resurgence now with the war fever and hysteria against Arabs or anyone wearing a turban, the serious erosion of civil liberties for racially profiled groups Another feature of nativism is its use to justify claims of differential rights for various minority groups. The issue of nativism is thus important to address in relation to the differences and potential conflicts among communities of color, since many Asian Americans and Latino/as are post-1965 immigrants The principle consequentialist argument against using nativism to justify differential rights is that it will produce (or in reality, merely maintain) a hierarchy of first and second class citizens. This is both undemocratic and undesirable as the kind of community many would want to live in. Nativist rhetoric has already justified state orchestrated murders and other horrors at the U.S.–Mexican border Nativist arguments might well tend to encourage people to turn a blind eye to what happens at the border. such enforced hierarchies of status within a society must surely share responsibility for creating the problems of crime and social insecurity that adversely affect everyone. The logic of nativism is based on the idea that those native to this country “deserve” more, not just because they have been here longer but because they or their relatives contributed the labor and ingenuity that made the U.S. wealthy. One might first want to point out that there are numerous groups within the U.S. that contributed labor and ingenuity toward the country’s wealth and that have not received any approximation of fair compensation. one could also argue that the wealth of the U.S. has been the product in no small part of neo-colonial and imperial global relations that ensured the extraction of natural resources at a price U.S. companies determined, as well as super-exploitation of labor that produced the capital brought back here.
Engagement is a process of strategic interaction.  It is the use of non-coercive diplomatic tools and initiatives to elicit cooperative behavior from the target state and to develop norms of diffuse reciprocity.  Engagement  this can be done through: (1) accommodation of the target state’s interests
the technology had already gotten positive reviews from the American Nuclear Society the World Nuclear Association and, in particular, from the IAEA the world's nuclear watchdog which called it "an attractive way to produce long-term nuclear energy with low radiotoxicity waste the new nuclear fuel that his company the Thorium Power Ltd., has been testing will be ready to license for commercial use within a decade.
In regards to standardized testing being “too frustrating” for our students and thus we should avoid at all cost, I know countless teachers who see the frustration on their students’ faces as not just defeat but rather persistence and resilience. We should do everything within our power to ensure that our students excel What message are we sending to children of this generation if we insist that if something is “too hard,” they can “opt out?” . A more pragmatic approach would be to prepare students through rigorous coursework and less emphasis on test preparation to aim for high achievement and excellence, even if they never achieve 100% proficiency. testing is one of those science parts of our job. We must continue to make these tests measure what students actually know rather than try to play gotcha We must continue to make these exams less culturally biased we are fooling ourselves if we think that students should not have any quantitative measures of identifying academic growth – even flawed ones such as the current iterations of high-stakes testing. we must continue to have high expectations of our students and their academic achievement, while also working to dismantle the current toxic high-stakes testing environment if we encourage them to simply “opt out” they are never going to learn. we are so deep in a contaminated era of mistrust and fear that many are afraid to even think of how to better prepare students for these exams. when we examine any high performing, high socio-economic public school across the country, we will see that they rarely if ever focus on test preparation to the extent that underperforming, lower socio-economic public schools do
a group supereducated, do-good feminists, most of whom would never need a welfare check spoke against reforms that would affect not us but poor women We mobilized not to speak for poor mothers but with them to speak for ourselves as feminists frustrated by the absence of women's voices and by the lack of gender equality concerns in the welfare debate speaking of "welfare as a women's issue," we argued that "a war against poor women is a war against all women." it failed to rally many women-even feminists. In fact, the war against poor women was just that: a war against poor women. middle-class women participated on the antiwelfare side the legislative record is devoid of a counternarrative that might temper administrative and judicial enforcement of the new law it is devoid of any discursive precedent for women friendly, equality-enhancing amendments to the new law. Because most feminists did not contest or disturb the Republican welfare paradigm, about all they can do now to fix the new welfare mess is urge that more money be spent on job training and childcare and that broader exceptions for battered women be adopted. but they do not repair the damage wrought by the new welfare law on the lives and rights of poor single mothers. Why were so many feminists unconcerned that welfare reform not only repealed poor single mothers' entitlement on their basic civil rights as well? we should reconceive welfare as the income owed to persons who work inside the home caring for, nurturing, and protecting children-mothering. The idea that welfare should support mothers in their caregiving roles should not be terribly controversial Racially charged images of lazy, promiscuous, and matriarchal women have dominated welfare discourse for quite some time the problem is that white and middle-class feminists-who are the mainstream of the women's movement view mothers who need welfare as mothers who need feminism. They see welfare mothers as victims-of patriarchy, maybe of racism, possibly of false consciousness. They don't see welfare mothers as feminist agents of their own lives-as women who are entitled to and capable of making independent and honorable choices about what kind of work they will do and how many children they will have and whether they will marry when many white, middle-class feminists weighed into the welfare debate, it was to prescribe reforms to assimilate welfare mothers to white feminists' own goals-principally, independence through paid employment. feminists have emphasized women's right to participate in men' feminists responded to their particular historical experiences, experiences drawn by an ethos of domesticity which confined middle-class women to the home. From this perspective, the home is the site of oppression for women, while the labor market is potentially liberating. But when middle-class women moved into the labor market, they did not trade in their caregiving obligations. Now doubly taxed by the dual responsibilities of earning and caring, many feminists have demanded labor market policies to address the family needs that fall disproportionately on women-parental leave and childcar they have been less interested in winning social policies to support women where we meet our family responsibilities: in the home. In the absence of widespread feminist attention to the social value of the childraising and home management work mothers do, poor mothers' right to do motherwork has been only faintly defended. The popular feminist claim that women earn independence, autonomy, and equality through wages historically has divided feminists along class and race lines, as women of color and poor white women have not usually earned equality from sweated labor wage work has been a mark of inequality: expected by the white society for whom they work; necessary because their male kin cannot find jobs or cannot earn family-supporting wages; and exploitative because their earnings keep them poor . Although feminism is fundamentally about winning women choices, our labor market bias has put much of feminism not on the side of vocational choice-the choice to work inside or out- side the home-but on the side of wage earning for all women. congressional feminists conflated their right to work outside the home with poor single mothers' obligation to do so Most single mothers work outside the home, and most single mothers who receive welfare want to The question is whether social policy should dictate that they must. Poor single mothers already shoulder a double burden in parenting: should social policy require them to perform yet another job? Unless we can establish a right to welfare, we cannot cure inequality where it is most gendered-in sexual, reproductive, and family relations. A right to income support in return for poor single mothers' caregiving work tackles the neglected side of the gender divide, the side that has defined women as the legal and economic de- pendents of men , it need not reproduce that divide. Rights that accommodate mothers' caregiving work need not ascribe motherwork to all women, nor only to women: men can mother, too. Nor need rights that accommodate mothers' care- giving work disparage women's choices and equality claims in the labor marke Ending welfare by re- defining it in this way will enable equality-in the safety net, be- tween the genders, among women, and under the Constitution.
Clinton’s dream of a “hemispheric common market, with open borders and open trade”, had further cemented a perception of a vast elitist network that reaches up as high as Hungarian-American business magnate George Soros, seeking to undermine American values and institutions “open borders” position is not exactly an elimination of borders as the geographic boundaries of a nation-state but the substantive reduction of movement-related barriers such as entry status, entry duration, entry qualifications, or entry quotes. For example, while the borders between Ireland and the United Kingdom may be considered conditionally open borders based on the sole requirement of nationality identification, the borders between the United States and the United Mexican States would immediately fall under the classification of controlled borders with restrictions on foreign-born migrants’ use of private and public resources, an extensive visa and quota system, and their subsequent enforcement Economic successes and losses may be left to the economists and to their future research Generally speaking, the “open borders” platform better spawns economic cosmopolitanism as opposed to cultural cosmopolitanism because of the manner it reduces nation-states into “an aggregate of individuals pursuing their material benefit” that an open borders policy may further challenge notions of citizenship, national identity, and culture, these moralists may say Rather than forsaking diversity as a whole, communal solidarity, English-language training, and national aid to affected localities may be the appropriate instruments as to social engineer a new shared sense of citizenship — one that may better accommodate economic successes and social capita While open borders may not be possible in terms of realpolitik or an appropriate policy out of national security concerns, the policy does reconsider ethical and moral frameworks present in contemporary United States and other Western nations, packaging a seductive idea with many arguments and keyhole solutions to popular criticism. It thus warrants mainstream discussion beyond empty platitudes about nation-state and sovereignty as any other sensitive issue — may be treated as if its merits means the entire well-being and ethical backbone of our nations
ISIS may already be thinking of using Ebola as a low-tech weapon of bio-terror Such groups could simply use human carriers to intentionally infect themselves in West Africa, then disseminate the deadly virus via the world’s air transportation system it wouldn’t be difficult for a terrorist group to simply waltz in and make off with some infected bodily fluids for use elsewhere at another time. They wouldn’t even have to “isolate” it who teaches a course in chemical and biological warfare The idea of using human carriers to intentionally spread deadly pathogens has been around for centuries. adversaries threw infected corpses over their enemy’s city walls in order to spread the deadly Bubonic Plague.
The world has achieved unprecedented peace, prosperity, and inter-dependence, but past achievements — and further progress — are threatened by a host of looming challenges Global institutions that served us well and transformed the world are becoming victims of their own success and must be reformed or replaced to deal with new challenges and take advantage of new opportunities. Governments everywhere face rising expectations and increasing demands but find themselves less able to manage the challenges they face the most difficult and most consequential challenges cannot be managed effectively without sustained cooperation between China, and the U S to work together on critical global challenges will determine whether the world is able to sustain and enhance mutually beneficial developments or fails to cope with the issues critical to the global future and to the security and prosperity This report represents a joint effort to develop both the rationale and concrete mechanisms for sustained, proactive collaboration to address challenges resulting from long-term global trends and consequential uncertainties. It builds on the findings of independent efforts to identify megatrends and potential game-changers with the goal of developing a framework for the US-China relationship that will better enable us to meet the challenges facing the global community and the strategic needs of both countries China and the U S hold different views on many bilateral and international issues, and that our relationship is constrained by mutual suspicion and strategic mistrust Leaders in both countries face relentless domestic pressures to focus on near-term issues, often to the detriment of long-term interests, as well as on looming US-China bilateral differences and mutual suspicions The primary reasons we need to work together on the global challenges are that they cannot be addressed successfully unless we do, and that failure to deal effectively with consequential megatrends will have deleterious consequences for China, the United States, and the world. It is difficult to envision a stable, prosperous global system absent a US-China relationship that is largely a cooperative one Forces and megatrends that are visible but not well understood today will shape the futures of people everywhere. The list include(s) consequences of globalization that increase prosperity but also increase demand for water, food, and energy. It also includes demographic change and effects of climate change that will intensify the consequences of other megatrends and make them more difficult to manage Zero-Sum World: Unsustainable drift leads to a world of predominantly zero-sum competition and conflict in the face of severe resource constraints. The result is economic crises and internal instability as well as interstate confrontation. There is risk of military conflict between major powers, which increases global mistrust and uncertainty and fosters an “each nation for itself” mentality that further undermines the ability of states to cooperate in the face of growing common challenges • There will be increasing stresses and strains on the global commons. Many challenges to the environment and human security will be intensified by rapidly increased food, water, and natural resource consumption due to growing population, urbanization, and rapid expansion of the middle class. If not managed well, these challenges could have a significant and long-term adverse impact on all nations and the global system • The future of the global economy is volatile. The developed countries, especially in the Eurozone, may face a prolonged period of recovery. The developing countries, including China face a “middle income trap”. The world could experience growing economic nationalism and trade protectionism as well as an accelerating adjustment of international industrial division of labor as China refocuses on domestic consumption-led growth, other nations increasingly displace China as the low-cost provider, and new manufacturing technologies and lower energy costs encourage the return of manufacturing to the United States and other developed countries Although no one can predict with confidence exactly how events will play out in the years ahead, we can be confident that the challenges and choices facing decision-makers at all levels and in all countries will be shaped by the interplay of megatrends, known uncertainties, unexpected “black swan” events, and the decisions of governments and nongovernmental actors For example, the world could experience intense monetary and trade protectionism, with countries seeking geopolitical advantage at the expense of international cooperation for the common good. It could see intensifying rivalries, creating hostilities and rendering cooperation on global challenges nearly impossible as global governmental mechanisms break down or are marginalized
Federal involvement in the centers continues to grow. The federal government is playing an essential role in the development and net- working of fusion centers by providing financial assistance, sponsoring security clearances, and providing personnel, guidance and training.19 The FBI has over 200 agents and analysts assigned to 36 fusion centers and plans to increase this commitment in the future.20 As of December 2006, the DHS alone has provided over $380 million in federal funds to support fusion centers.21 At least one fusion center, the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center (MCAC), was initiated and led by federal authorities and was only recently turned over to the control of state officials. Thirty percent of ostensibly state-controlled fusion centers are physically located within federal agency workspace.22 Fusion center supporters argue that the federal gov- ernment can use the “800,000 plus law enforcement officers across the country” to “function as the ‘eyes and ears’ of an extended national security community Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff declared that “what we want to do is create but a network across the country.”
to turn to possibilities for reform aspires to tone up Madisonian muscles one by one with ad hoc legislative and judicial reforms, narrowing the scope of the state secrets privilege; permitting the recipients of national security letters at least to make their receipt public; broadening standing requirements; improving congressional oversight of covert operations, including drone killings and cyber operations; or strengthening statutory constraints like FISA . But their stopgap approach has been tried repeatedly since the Trumanite network’s emergence. Its futility is now glaring. Why such efforts would be any more fruitful in the future is hard to understand the rule of law to which they are committed is largely devoid of meaningful constraints. Continued focus on legalist band-aids merely buttresses the illusion that the Madisonian institutions are alive and well—and with that illusion, an entire narrative premised on the assumption that it is merely a matter of identifying a solution and looking to the Madisonian institutions to effect it. What is needed, if Bagehot’s theory is correct, is a fundamental change in the very discourse within which U.S. national security policy is made.
Today, the scenario is different. The PLA is not prepared to fight a war of pride. It has not fought a battle for more than 30 years nuclear warfare in a limited confrontation is not in the calculations of military planning. Despite China’s naval projection in the Indian Ocean and Seychelles an India-China confrontation on the high seas is a distant speculation
The emergency plans put in place ahead of the hurricane season, lasting from June to November each year, prevent loss of human life or reduce it to a minimum. However, they are not so effective against economic damage. adaptation is necessary We are undertaking climate studies in Cuba, and we have our own evaluations and our own models to predict the impact levels we have to face financial resources, knowledge, technology and a national infrastructure of both material and human resources are needed in order to combat problems that are not primarily of developing nations’ making. “How can they take climate adaptation on board, when they lack education Cuba is facing above all, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, particularly related to water circulation in the atmosphere, on land and underground, including tropical hurricanes From the educational and social point of view, the community ought to know what it is up against, because climate change added to soil degradation, water pollution, shortage of water for human consumption and other environmental problems are creating a complex global scenario.¶
140 Nobel laureates urged China to release Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo This flagrant violation of the basic right to due process and free expression must be publicly and forcefully confronted by the international community Another Tiananmen protest leader signed the document The first step in political reform is to tolerate dissidents and cherish their value and contribution to society
The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly enumerate a positive fundamental right to education the Supreme Court and federal and state legislatures have been the catalysts through which the right to education has been developed positive right to education is something that the Supreme Court has never recognized in the context of education. A positive right would be an affirmative right that the government must provide a certain quantum or quality of education
Technology is ontologically devastating, because it usurps all other modes of revealing. With every thing standing in reserve for our use, “distance” disappears This blurring of borders is the main indicator of an unchecked anthropomorphism. This anthropomorphism that objectifies the world in order to exploit it is also one that creates the world in its own image, where everything that human kind comes into contact with becomes an extension of itself. the ultimate victory of technological human kind is a delusion. Its sovereignty would be catastrophic, because delusion may be come accepted as reality. Human nature and human freedom still lie in the balance. The danger is that intensive technological production will over power human's capacity for diverse modes of disclosure. Philosophic thought would be re placed with utilitarian cognition; artistic creativity would atrophy as a result of endless innovative production, and political action would be obviated by social en engineering. calculative thinking would be accepted and practised as the only way of thinking. Calculation refuses to let anything appear except what is count able ... Calculative thinking compels itself into a compulsion to master everything on the basis of the consequential correctness of its proce dure technological calculation and innovation may satisfy our needs to such an extent that we would not even notice what we had lost.
my argument is that, for structural reasons, the institutional role that the Court is destined to play within our constitutional scheme of government is the role of assuring the continued subordination of racial minority interests. On the contrary, the most potent method of perpetuating minority subordination in the United States has proven to be through the intermittent issuance of highly visible minority victories.
Horizon 2020 The launch of the Work Programme for 2014-2015 heralds the beginning of the funding application process for many businesses and researchers. Horizon 2020 is expected to grant more freedom to applicants, and the inclusion of marine dimensions in every societal challenge that the programme addresses is, as such, a big win for the sector. Cross-cutting marine and maritime research, which offers great opportunity for cross-cutting calls and pan-European synergies Actions in this area will be in line with the EU Blue Growth Strategy and relevant EU policies, as well as provide international cooperation opportunities in particular for Atlantic Ocean research. The calls in this area invite, for example, proposals on Atlantic observation systems, an integrated response capacity to oil spills and marine pollution, climate change impacts on fisheries and aquaculture and ocean literacy.¶ Horizon 2020 is amongst the globe’s largest publicly funded research funds.
On paper, the PLA stacks up pretty well compared to the U.S. military But in a competition that historically favors quality over quantity, size doesn’t always matter—particularly in today’s technology driven warfare
we cannot ignore the more prosaic frictions that inevitably arise in such a broad and dynamic relationship. these have included spats over chickens and washing machines, while the latest issue revolves around tomatoes. Tomato disputes have a long history. After decades of tomato trade wars, the signing of (NAFTA) in 1992 eliminated tariffs on Mexican tomatoes over a ten-year transition period, despite the opposition of Florida agricultural producers at the behest of Florida’s tomato industry, the U.S. Commerce Department initiated an anti-dumping investigation to determine whether tomato imports from Mexico were being sold at less than fair market value Mexican producers agreed to a minimum price for imports. This so-called “suspension agreement” has been honored for 16 years, Fast forward to the electoral year of 2012, and Florida tomato growers have requested that the Commerce Department end the suspension agreement so they can initiate a new anti-dumping investigation against Mexican tomatoes. The Mexican government is taking the threat to Mexico’s principal agricultural export very seriously. According to data from the Mexican Embassy in Washington DC, the tomato sector provides more than 350,000 jobs in Mexico, while exporting $2.1 billion worth of tomatoes last year, 93 percent of which were shipped to the U.S.
For many people the idea of anti-capitalism seems ridiculous After all, look at the fantastic technological innovations in the goods and services in recent years smart phones driverless cars Jumbotron screens video games increases in the productivity of labor compare the U S between 1965 and 2015: Life expectancy is longer; infant mortality lower And now, in the 21st century, this improvement in basic standards of living is happening even in the poorer regions of the world as well: look at the improvement in material standards of living of people in China since China embraced the free market. What’s more, look what happened when Russia and China tried an alternative to capitalism! So, if you care about improving the lives of people, how can you be anticapitalist? That is one story, the standard story. Here is another story: The hallmark of capitalism is poverty in the midst of plenty. This is not the only thing wrong with capitalism, but it is the feature of capitalist economies that is its gravest failing. the poverty of children who bear no responsibility for their plight morally reprehensible in rich societies where such poverty could be easily eliminated Yes, there is economic growth, technological innovation downward diffusion of consumer goods but along with capitalist economic growth comes destitution for many whose livelihoods have been destroyed by the advance of capitalism and alienating work for the majority Capitalism is an inequality enhancing machine as well as a growth machine driven by the relentless search for profits destroying the environment the issue is not whether material conditions on average have improved in the long run but rather whether, looking forward things would be better for most people in an alternative kind of economy It is true that the authoritarian economies of twentieth century Russia and China were failures, but these are not the only possibilities Both of these accounts are anchored in the realities of capitalism It is not an illusion that capitalism has increased human productivity; many people have benefited But equally, it is not an illusion that capitalism generates great harms and perpetuates eliminable forms of human suffering. Margaret Thatcher famously announced There is No Alternative another world is indeed possible it would improve the conditions for human flourishing for most people. elements of this new world are already being created in the world as it is. And there are ways to move from here to there. Anti-capitalism is possible not simply as a moral stance towards the harms and injustices in the world in which we live, but as a practical stance towards building an alternative for greater human flourishing.
In the growth of human society, families came first, communities second, and only much later came the institutions set up by the community to serve it. Most institutional rhetoric — the proclaiming of what is important — borrows its values from those of individual families that work well together spokesmen for institutional life have demanded a role above and beyond service to families and communities. They have sought to command and prescribe as kings used to do, though there is an important difference. In the case of ancient kings, once beyond the range of their voices and trumpets you could usually do what you pleased; but in the case of modem institutions, the reach of technology is everywhere — there is no escape if the place where you live and the family you live in cannot provide sanctuary Institutions, say their political philosophers, are better at creating marching orders for the human race than families are; therefore they should no longer be expected to follow but should lead. Institutional leaders have come to regard themselves as great synthetic fathers to millions of synthetic children, by which I mean to all of us. This theory sees us bound together in some abstract family relationship in which the state is the true mother and father; hence it insists on our first and best loyalty Ask not,” said President Kennedy, “what your country can do for you, but rather ask what you can do for your country.” Since the “you” in question is both real and human and the country you are alleged to possess is one of the most extreme of verbal abstractions, it will readily be seen that the president’s injunction is an expression of a synthetic family philosophy which regards “nation” as possessing a claim superior to the claim of “family”. If you see nothing wrong with this, then it is probable you also believe that, with a little tinkering, our schools will work just fine we may need less school, not more III I want to examine the destructive effects the false claim of institutional prerogative has on both individual and family life, a destructiveness equally profound whether the claim comes from a government, a corporation, or some other form of network. that every one of our national institutions is a place where men, women, and children are isolated according to some limited aspect of their total humanity: by age, and a few other considerations in the case of compulsory schooling, as well as by various other sorting mechanisms in the other institutional arenas. If performance within these narrow confines is conceived to be the supreme measure of success, if, for instance, an A average is considered the central purpose of adolescent life — the requirements for which take most of the time and attention of the aspirant — and if the worth of the individual is reckoned by victory or defeat in this abstract pursuit, then a social machine has been constructed which, by attaching purpose and meaning to essentially meaningless and fantastic behavior, will certainly dehumanize students, alienate them from their own human nature, and break the natural connection between them and their parents, to whom they would otherwise look for significant affirmations the United States has become a nation of institutions, whereas it used to be a nation of communities. Large cities have great difficulty supporting healthy community life, partly because of the coming and going of strangers, partly because of space constrictions, partly because of poisoned environments, but mostly because of the constant competition of institutions By isolating young and old from the working life of places and by isolating the working population from the lives of young and old, institutions have brought about a fundamental disconnection of the generations. The griefs that arise from this have no synthetic remedy no vibrant, satisfying communities can come into being where young and old are locked away Here and there mutilated versions of community struggle to survive, as in places where cultural homogeneity has been fiercely protected Institutional goals, however sane and well-intentioned, are unable to harmonize deeply with the uniqueness of individual human goals. No matter how good the individuals who manage an institution are, institutions lack a conscience because they measure by accounting methods. Institutions are not the sum total of their personnel, or even of their leadership, but are independent of both and will exist after management has been completely replaced. They are ideas come to life, ideas in whose service all employees are but servomechanisms. The deepest purposes of these gigantic networks are to regulate and to make uniform. whenever institutions intervene significantly in personal affairs they cause much damage. By redirecting the focus of our lives from families and communities to institutions we, in effect, anoint a machine our king every institution’s unstated first goal is to survive and grow, not to undertake the mission it has nominally staked out for itself. Thus the first goal of a government it is to provide protection for its employees and perhaps a modest status ladder for the more ambitious ones It was this philistine potential that teaching the young for pay would inevitably expand into an institution for the protection of teachers, not students that made Socrates condemn the Sophists so strongly long ago in ancient Greece. think of the public school system one of the largest business organizations on planet Earth While the education administered by this abstract parent is illregarded by everybody, the institution’s right to compel its clientele to accept such dubious service is still guaranteed by the police.
A general right to immigrate also would conflict with American citizens’ right to self-government. Immigration can change the character of a society, for better or worse; large-scale immigration can change a society quickly, radically, and irrevocably (just ask the Tibetans). Since self-government is a fundamental and well-established human right, the citizens of particular nations arguably should retain, through their elected officials, significant control over immigration policies. Admission and exclusion are at the core of communal independence. They suggest the deepest meaning of self-determination. Without them, there could not be communities of [a specific] character, historically stable, ongoing associations of men and women with some special commitment to one another and some special sense of their common life.”22 societies that are sustainable, for example, or that limit inequalities of wealth, or that treat women and men as equals. which may provide meaning, secure justice, and contribute substantially to people’s quality of life, must be compromised Such a situation does not call for the creation of a new right that undermines the self-government of others. Instead it suggests that would-be immigrants need to take up responsibilities for self-government that they and their leaders have neglected in their own countries.23
Amid all this is a perhaps unexpected reality—the people who are most optimistic about their future are the most disadvantaged: poor black Americans black people are, on average, 1.1 points higher on the optimism scale Black people on average score above 8 The starkest disparity is found in the detail that poor black people are almost three times as likely to be a point higher on the optimism scale than poor white people poor black people are half as likely to report experiencing stress the previous day than poor white people Desperation, stress, and worry are closely linked to a greater risk of premature death People with low levels of optimism and high levels of stress and worry are more likely to die from deaths of despair, or to live in areas with high levels of such deaths. The link between optimism and longevity is strong Among Americans born between 1935 and 1945, those who reported higher levels of optimism as young adults were much more likely to be alive in 2015 than less optimistic people. 86 percent of pessimists died by 2015, while only 77 percent of the optimists did black and Hispanic people are more likely to report that their lives are better than their parents’ lives. While discrimination still exist, minorities have been making gradual progress in narrowing gaps with education, wages, and life expectancy. Some of this is because of concrete gains made by those communities.
economic collapse is accompanied by social chaos, civil unrest and a breakdown of law and order Societal collapse usually refers to the fall or disintegration of human societies It broadly includes both abrupt societal failures typified by collapses, and more extended gradual declines of superpowers

A growing body of legal scholarship argues that an increased role for the federal government in education is a normatively desirable Kimberly Jenkins Robinson, who served in the General Counsel’s office at the U.S. Department of Education argues that an increased federal role in education is necessary Another scholar argues that the central role education has always held in our society necessitates a judicially-enforceable fundamental right Goodwin Liu, recently appointed to the California Supreme Court, argues that the very text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the concept of national citizenship at least authorizes, if not compels, the creation of a “common set of educational expectations for meaningful national citizenship This Comment pushes back on scholarship that supports federal solutions

, many capitalists are getting rich off the high seas, a vast reservoir of wealth holding 95% of the planet’s water, spanning 70% of the Earth’s surface a new free market where capitalists roam like pirates, plundering wealth and treating our oceans as a freebie gold mine and trash dump We already know we can’t feed 10 billion. Now we’re polluting their water. Won’t be enough clean water for all to drink, triggering wars human activities have so altered the basic chemistry of the seas that they are now experiencing evolution in reverse: a return to the barren primeval waters of hundreds of millions of years ago.” Capitalism is turning back evolutionary clock a billion years Evolution in reverse? Yes, planet Earth is regressing eons to an earlier primitive era. Unregulated free-market competition on the high seas is turning back the evolutionary clock. That doesn’t bother today’s short-term-thinking capitalists. But it should. Because, ironically, shifting evolution into reverse will also self-destruct the very global economy that capitalism needs for future growth. Today’s capitalists see another three billion people as the new customers needed to expand free markets globally. But in the process they are also cutting their own throats, unaware they’re pushing a hidden self-destruct button lodged in their brains. Nature designed all systems with these built-in termination buttons. Deny it all you want, but humans have our entrances and exits, as Shakespeare said. We all do. Same with economic systems capitalism at the end of its 500-year cycle Capitalists deny their role in their endgame, dismiss the long economic cycle. That’s natural. Capitalist brains are designed to focus on the short term, profits, high frequencies, microseconds, day-end closing prices, quarterly earnings, annual bonuses. Rarely longer. Myopia is the built-in self-destruct trigger for capitalists, their society, the human race, our planet’s water Capitalists see a new world like the Wild West. No lawmen, just free-market competitors, free to do whatever they want, whenever, unregulated, uncontrolled, no restraints, skimming, mining, plundering the wealth of the high seas, free to use, misuse and abuse vast oceans of water at no real cost. Here are 10 ways capitalists are pocketing their short-term profits, leaving long-term losses for the public to pay: 1. Pollution creating new oceanic garbage dump Sielen’s imagery is powerful: “The oceans’ problems start with pollution, the most visible forms of which are the catastrophic spills from offshore oil and gas drilling or from tanker accidents.” But that “pollution pales in comparison to the much less spectacular waste that finds its way to the seas through rivers, pipes, runoff, and the air ... trash, plastic bags, bottles, cans” washing into “coastal waters or discarded by ships ... drifts out to sea ... forms epic gyres of floating waste” covering “hundreds of miles.” 2. Destruction of marine life costs jobs and more “The prospect of vanishing whales, polar bears, bluefin tuna, sea turtles, and wild coasts should be worrying enough on its own,” warns Sielen. “But the disruption of entire ecosystems threatens our very survival, since it is the healthy functioning of these diverse systems that sustains life on earth.” Destruction on this level” has massive consequences, and costs “humans dearly in terms of food, jobs, health, and quality of life.” 3. Toxic chemicals polluting our waters It gets far worse: “The most dangerous pollutants are chemicals” poisoning the oceans with toxins, says Sielen. They “travel great distances, accumulate in marine life, and move up the food chain.” Mercury from burning coal “rains down on the oceans, rivers, and lakes.” Each year hundreds of new untested industrial chemicals “build up slowly in the tissues of fish and shellfish,” get passed to larger creatures and humans “causing death, disease, and abnormalities,” adversely affecting “development of the brain, the neurologic system, and the reproductive system in humans.” 4. Deadly fertilizers are polluting oceans Add to this disaster scenario fertilizers, which are now rising at excessive levels causing “havoc on the natural environment,” an explosive growth of algae, decomposition, a loss of “oxygen needed to support complex marine life.” This trend is creating “dead zones devoid of the ocean life” that “have more than quadrupled” in a decade. 5. Humans are eating too many fish World population was less than 3 billion in 1950, 6 billion in 2000. Projected at 10 billion in 2050. Sielen warns: “Humans are simply killing and eating too many fish,” with fish supplies falling “dramatically.” Tuna, swordfish, halibut, flounder populations dropped 90% since 1950. “Human appetite has nearly wiped those populations out.” 6. Fish supplies disappear, demand is increasing And demand keeps growing as supplies “are rapidly dwindling.” Exploding prices add to the demand: This year, a 489-pound bluefin tuna sold for $1.7 million making it “profitable to employ airplanes and helicopters to scan the ocean for the fish that remain; against such technologies, marine animals don’t stand a chance.” Small fish like sardines, anchovy, herring, are also disappearing, meaning less food for bigger fish up the food chain. 7. Destructive, wasteful fishing methods Unfortunately, “modern industrial fishing fleets drag lines with thousands of hooks miles behind a vessel,” with “nets thousands of feet below the sea’s surface.” Untargeted seals, turtles, dolphins, whales, albatross get entangled, killing millions of tons each year. “Some of the most destructive fisheries discard 80% to 90%.” In the Gulf of Mexico, “for every pound of shrimp ... over three pounds of marine life is thrown away.” 8. Destroying marine habitats kills future growth Another factor destroying our oceans: “The destruction of the habitats that have allowed spectacular marine life to thrive for millennia,” says Sielen. And yet capitalism continues the “wholesale destruction of deep-ocean habitats ... submerged mountain chains called seamounts,” some higher than Mt Rainier. They are “homes to a rich variety of marine life.” Yet, industrial trawlers bulldoze their way” destroying “deep cold-water corals, some older than the California redwoods.” 9. Acid buildup in oceans weakens marine life “The buildup of acid in ocean waters,” warns Sielen “reduces the availability of calcium carbonate, a key building block for the skeletons and shells of corals, plankton, shellfish, and many other marine organisms” that need it “to grow and also to guard against predators.” 10. Our planet Earth is in hot water Echoing findings by 2,000 scientists in the recent Fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Sielen says scientists predict “climate change will drive the planet’s temperature up by between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of this century” causing “hotter oceans ... rising sea levels ... stronger storms” as the “life cycles of plants and animals are upended, changing migration patterns, causing other serious disruptions ... surface waters mixing less with cooler, deeper waters,” reducing phytoplankton population, “the foundation of the ocean’s food chain.” The recent Warsaw Agreement on Climate Change, like earlier United Nations accords in Kyoto and Copenhagen, exposes how capitalist power-players control governmental decision-makers, prompting Sielen’s final warning: So long as pollution, overfishing, and ocean acidification remain concerns only for scientists ... little will change ... Diplomats and national security experts, who understand the potential for conflict in an overheated world, should realize that climate change might soon become a matter of war and peace ... Business leaders should understand better than most the direct links between healthy seas and healthy economies ... And government officials, who are entrusted with the public’s well-being, must surely see the importance of clean air, land, and water can we summon the political will and moral courage to restore the seas to health before it is too late? The consequences are catastrophic ... the risks enormous ... odds very long ... fuse short ... yet the denial may be too overwhelming
Democracy today is not the living breathing, activity of politics. The apparent suspension of social hierarchy in elections is the form of its opposite: it’s a disavowal of the antagonisms rupturing the social democratic fundamentalism attempts to ensure that nothing will happen. It precludes politics, if by politics we have in mind actions that can produce major change. democracy conditions and binds our thinking—anything that is not democratic is necessarily horrible, totalitarian, unacceptable to any rational person.   democratic universality appears in Zizek’s early thinking as a necessary fiction, as an impossible universality that opens up because of an excess, obstacle, or stain that impedes it. In the wake of the intensification of capital and racist fundamentalisms this opening no longer exists, the empty place of democracy now appears as a politically hopeless insofar as Capital, that other system that relies on disruption, crisis, and excess, displaces the excess necessary for democracy Insofar as we play the democratic game of leaving the place of power empty, of accepting the gap between this place and our occupying are we—democrats—all not . . . faithful to castration?” Continued service to democracy today functions as our disavowal of the foreclosure of the political under global capital. Instead of a political practice structured around change we have instead a democratic fundamentalism that renders change unthinkable.   the “only question which confronts political philosophy today” is whether liberal democracy is “the ultimate horizon of our political practice,”
a nuclear deal between Russia and Venezuela will lock Russia into behavior and rhetoric that are inherently anti-American, jeopardizing the progress that has been made in U.S.-Russia relations since 2009. Russia offered Venezuela nuclear power in 2008, the absolute low-point in U.S.-Russia relations, The realization of the nuclear partnership will place Russia back into a position of confronting the West as it did two years ago when tensions were running high. Venezuela is within its rights to receive and operate civilian nuclear facilities. observers who buy Chávez’s line that the program is intended for peaceful power generation may be naïve : the implications of the program are damaging, even if the intentions are sound.
then slavery as the conversion of person into property would simply be an extreme form of labor exploitation. Or, vice versa, exploitation would be an attenuated form of slavery. When she returns, in a more recent article on voting rights and native disappearance, to reprise her concept of racial slavery, she has this to say about the ideological formation of anti-black racism and its effects on critical intellectual production: Because Africa is the property of Europe, Africa must then appear as always, already colonized. […] The colonization of Africa must disappear so that Africa can appear as ontologically colonized. Only through this disavowed colonization can Black peoples be ontologically relegated to the status of property. Native peoples by contrast, are situated as potential citizens. Smith rightly argues that the racist designation of native people as free, albeit uncivilized, precitizens is not a privilege (i.e. proximity to whiteness) in relation to the racist designation of black people as unfree anti-citizens incapable of civilization (i.e. antipode of whiteness) Yet, what is missed in the attempt to demonstrate that at is also, like Native Studies, concerned with colonization is the plain fact that colonization is not essential, much less prerequisite, to enslavement . Colonization is not a necessary condition of enslavement because: 1) slaves need not be colonial subjects, or objects of colonial exploitation, and they do not face the fundamental directive of colonialism, ‘you, work for me’, though slaves often enough labor; and 2) slaves need not be settler colonial subjects, or objects of settler colonial genocide, since they do not face the fundamental directive ‘you, go away’, though slaves often enough are driven from their native land. But the crucial problem with this formulation of the relations between racial slavery, settler colonialism and capitalism (leaving aside any problems with the pillar of Orientalism) has to do with the drive to confound the position of blacks in order to describe them as exploited and colonized degree zero. . Slavery is not a loss that the self experiences – of language, lineage, land, or labor – but rather the loss of any self that could experience such loss. Any politics based in resurgence or recovery is bound to regard the slave as ‘the position of the unthought’
Public Charge Relevance in Immigration Policy public charge provisions have a longstanding history of being attached to immigration policies to safeguard public resources and exclude immigrants these have not kept up with the developments in U.S. social policy concerning individuals with physical or mental disabilities misconceptions is the idea that immigrants are or will become a public burden taking advantage of public assistance programs limit availability of welfare programs outdated provisions are causing harm jeopardizing the general immigration and welfare policies also heavily restrict access to federal and state assistance programs even after an immigrant has gained legal permanent residency the participation of immigrants in public benefit programs has decreased sharply Impacts on Immigrants with Disabilities there was at least an estimated 15 percent of individuals in immigration proceedings with existing mental disorders/disabilities approximately 57,000 individuals case. One of the victories out of exposing the maltreatment of individuals with disabilities is the initiative Discrimination Under the Law Since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act Public charge provisions are discriminatory and fundamentally against the principles of the Americans with disabilities Act address some of the exclusions due to “public charge” determination or other grounds for inadmissibility. At the same time, the determination of “public charge” and other exclusions often rests on the discretion of either the Secretary of Homeland Security, federal legislators should consider in any discussion of a truly comprehensive immigration policy rooted in the dignity of immigrants communities immigrants with disabilities directly affected continue to be part of this discussion : Eliminating the “Public Charge” Provision Given the expanded explanation of “public charge” under the Clinton administration coupled with the approval of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, any future comprehensive immigration policy which includes a path to legalization and status adjustment should exclude any “public charge” provision, and instead, enumerate ways in which individuals with mental or physical disabilities may apply for status adjustment, given the same considerations as other “able-bodied” individuals
he Deep Seabed Hard Minerals Resources Act (the “Resources Act”) governs conduct by U.S. nationals (citizens, vessels, and others subject to U.S. jurisdiction) that engage in exploration for, and commercial recovery of, hard mineral resources on the deep seabed outside of U.S. waters This Act, implemented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
TSA had improved its screener performance measures GAO concluded that it could benefit from monitoring private versus Federal screener performance TSA added measures to better address the strategic goals and mission of screening in its assessments of screener performance at private and Federal airports GAO noted that consistent monitoring of SPP versus non-SPP performance would help ensure that the screening and protection at SPP airports matched or exceeded that at non-SPP airports, and would ensure that SPP airports were operating as intended. GAO recommended TSA develop guidance for SPP applicants that included 1) TSA's criteria and process for assessing whether SPP participation would compromise security or detrimentally affect screening cost-efficiency or effectiveness; 2) how TSA would obtain and analyze cost information on screening cost-efficiency and effectiveness and the implications of airports not responding to related application questions; and 3) specific examples of additional information airports should consider providing to help TSA assess their suitability for SPP TSA needed to improve some aspects of its administration of SPP to help avoid the risk of not selecting the best contractor to provide screening services Because administration includes in-depth examination of airport applications and private contractor offers, which requires detailed calculations and analysis, TSA should ensure that decisionmakers have accurate information.
Moscow’s current foreign policy aims to embroil the continent in a contest with Washington Russia still covets a global or even superpower status equal to that of the United States. Thus it wants to be a member of every international organization that exists whether it has any real interests in the area. This craving for status lies at the heart of Russian foreign policy. : “Moscow should seek to preserve the special character of Russian-American relations. Washington should recognize the exceptional status of the Russian Federation in the formation of a new system of international relations, a role different from that which […] any other center of power plays in the global arena.” Consequently Russian policy in Latin America is ultimately an American policy. It aims to instrumentalize the region as a series of countries or even a weak but still discernible political bloc to support Russian positions against US dominance in world affair Therefore Latin American states that wish to challenge America need to rely on Moscow Moscow’s policy is part of its larger effort, to realize this so-called multipolar world
Florida’s shoreline was apparently untouched by any raw petroleum before the Deepwater Horizon disaster according to what authorities consider to be the most exhaustive detective work yet on tar balls .S. Coast Guard lab findings defy the long-standing belief that a regular ingredient of at least some of the tar balls that for years have turned up occasionally on state beaches is either crude spilled during offshore drilling or oil that seeped from natural vents under the Gulf Of the 192 batches None of the samples was identified as containing unprocessed, crude oil
Methane emissions are worse than the conventional wisdom would have you believe, according to a new study by researchers at Stanford University. Traditionally, environmental regulators and energy industry groups have estimated methane emissions by multiplying the amount of methane emitted by a specific source – e.g., belching cattle or methane leaks at natural gas processing plants – by the number of that source type in a geographic region. . That is how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has traditionally calculated methane emissions since the 1990s. If the methane emissions rates (e.g., how much methane does a cow emit in a year?) are wrong, the total estimated methane emissions are also wrong. Several studies have tested the accuracy of these traditional methane emissions estimates by using airplanes and towers to measure actual methane in the air The new study, “Methane Leakage from North American Natural Gas Systems,” evaluated more than 200 of these atmospheric studies and concluded that the EPA’s methane emissions estimates are too low. The key take-away: the EPA is likely underestimating U.S. methane emissions from natural gas by at least 50% or more. . “Atmospheric tests covering the entire country indicate emissions around 50% more than EPA estimates. And that’s a moderate estimate.” methane leaks from the natural gas system are likely to worse than previously thought
one of the noteworthy features of environmental thought is its embrace of a pluralistic mode of environmental value and action that accommodates both the prudent use and the preservation of nature, rather than demanding that we must always choose between these commitments. It is a way of thinking that accepts the interpenetrating character of intrinsic and instrumental values in experience, the basic continuity of means and ends in environmental thought and practice it incorporates critical elements of both sensibilities in a more holistic, balanced, and practical vision of human environmental experience this pragmatic strain in environmental thought views humans as thoroughly embedded in natural systems. this recognition does not lead to the conclusion that humans have carte blanche with respect to the natural world, or that there is no moral limit to the domination of human will over the landscape the view supports a wider and more integrative perspective in which human ideals and interests (including economic interests, but also other nonmaterial social, cultural, and political values) are understood to be wrapped up in the natural and built environment, and are secured and promoted through deliberate and broad-based planning and conservation efforts
Obama should make it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba by ending pre-travel approval 59 House Democrats wrote in a letter to the president Lawmakers want individuals and groups to be able to travel under a general license visitors to Cuba would be able to travel without hassle more Americans can engage in people-to-people diplomacy that can promote democratic change and advance human rights helping Cubans create more jobs and opportunities to further expand their independence
Empirical support for the economic growth rate is much weaker. The finding that poor economic performance is associated with a higher likelihood of territorial conflict initiation is significant only in Models 3–4.14 The weak results are not altogether surprising given the findings from prior literature.  the likelihood that a U.S. President will use force is uncertain, as the bad economy might create incentives both to divert the public’s attention with a foreign adventure and to focus on solving the economic problem, thus reducing the inclination to act abroad Fordham DeRouen and Gowa find no relation between a poor economy and U.S. use of force Leeds and Davis that the conflict-initiating behavior of 18 industrialized democracies is unrelated to economic conditions as do Pickering and Kisangani and Russett and Oneal These results suggest that embattled leaders are much more likely to respond with territorial diversions to direct signs of their unpopularity (e.g., strikes, protests, riots) than to general background conditions such as economic malaise

Almost 33,000 native inhabitants, or 70 percent of Guam's nearly 47,000 registered voters, need to sign up with the government's decolonization registry for the plebiscite on their preferred political status to kick off only 6,760 have signed up. Robert Underwood told Kyodo News this could be because some local people are already comfortable with and enjoying the status quo, particularly the privileges provided by the U.S. government such as food stamps and education subsidies. Jeashalyn Fejaran who belongs to the native inhabitants called Chamorro, admits, "I'm pretty comfortable with where we're at right now,"
the United States cannot ease the problems China's leaders face without fundamentally altering the present international order. The recommendations of the accommodationists would have just that result They would expand the ties between the U.S. military and the Chinese military Allowing China to join the community of nations without regard to its behavior as a member of that community would indeed change the principles of the international order to suit the needs of China's leadership would even these concessions be enough? The answer is almost certainly no the strategy of engagement may be the most perilous of all. It neither satisfies the demands of the emerging power nor deters that power effectively enough to prevent a serious confrontation the policy that appears most fraught with near-term risk offers the best chance of peace over the long run. the years from 1981 through 1984 were a time of intense confrontation ." But the four years of tensions and confrontation were immediately followed by the most fruitful period of relations in Cold War history Such a strategy needs to be applied to China today our unwillingness to force them to play by our rules is too risky for the health of the international order The United States cannot and should not be willing to upset the international order in the mistaken belief that accommodation is the best way to avoid a confrontation with China. We should hold the line instead That means not trading with the Chinese military or doing business with firms the military owns or operates Containment would seek to compel Beijing to choose political liberalization We need to force the Chinese leaders to make similar calculations of risk and benefit. we will need to go through periods of bad relations with China This new China strategy may seem counterproductive at first, because Chinese leaders would surely respond to it in a fury and with threatening gestures. But over time it is the only strategy with a chance of success, and it is less likely to result in serious confrontation than the current confused combination of containment and appeasement
Special education and language-minority students are under-represented in charter schools, Even when the students are selected in a lottery, they are discouraged from attending charter schools when the schools do not provide the services they require.
Even though women still had to assume the double burden of working in the workforce and then taking care of children and cooking in the home, the fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs, either in the cities or … in the fields, and so that brought women out of the confinements of the household, and so female labor force participation was really the highest in the world in the early communist era. The rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do , even today, you see the legacy of that early communist era, because China's female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries , in the last couple of decades, you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality. “With the dismantling of the planned economies, so many women have been laid off relative to men , and that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown, is because of that dissatisfaction with this huge gender gap what these women are doing is actually in line with the Chinese government's expressed belief in gender equality The workforce is shrinking, and birthrates are falling and the population is aging drastically. So the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates, and it's very aggressively pushing particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies. the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do, because these young feminists are telling other women, ‘No, you don't have to get married, you don't have to have babies if you don't want to.’ sexism and misogyny and the subjugation of women — pushing women to return to these traditional roles of dutiful wife and mother — all of that is at the core of China's patriarchal authoritarianism there is very aggressive propaganda that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn 30 Then there's also policies. So, the much-publicized, so-called one-child policy recently ended, so China officially now has a two-child policy But in spite of this really dramatic policy change on population, the birth rates still fell last year, There's this huge confrontation now between the agenda of the government this enormous upswelling of particularly educated young women who are pushing back in every way, and so what is unfolding right now is just an extraordinary moment in China's history in spite of the intense internet censorship — which has become incredibly sophisticated — these women find ways of circulating their message and getting around the censorship. They're continually playing this game of cat and mouse and coming up with new ways to get around the censorship just as much as the Chinese government has been very effective in controlling the free flow of information through heavy controls on the Internet, that in this era of global connectivity, where there are also a lot of young Chinese people who leave China ... they're constantly communicating individually with their friends back home it's very, very hard for the government to completely shut that communication down.”
the Bush presidency involved the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Congress accused the President of overstepping his executive authority, bypassing Congress, and 56 invading Iraq solely on Presidential prerogative Through several attempts by the UN, the Bush administration warned Hussein that denying UN inspectors into the country to search for chemical and biological weapons would have serious repercussions Contained in the Iraq Resolution were assertions that the President’s constitutional power was to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States. Once again, Congress was being asked to authorize the president to begin a war, without a formal declaration. ). Irons correctly states that the war-declaring power belongs to the executive.
Neoliberalism is a sociopolitical movement rooted in the struggles against socialism and communism in Europe in the early twentieth century, and which ultimately opposed and undermined social democracy in Western countries in the second half of that century. Its roots in the United States are found among right-wing libertarians, anti-communists and conservative traditionalists who gave rise to the New Right in the 1950s. The first national leader of the New Right was Barry Goldwater Jr., senator from Arizona. Known as Mr. Conservative, he is credited, among others, with the rebirth of the American conservative political movement that today consists of neoliberalism and neoconservatism. In the 1960s the New Right took on populist tones, became linked to the religious right, and began to focus on opposing the progress made by the civil rights movement on social issues. In 1971, Powell Jr. (1971), a corporate lawyer from Virginia and representative of the tobacco industry who would become a justice of the US Supreme Court in 1972, submitted a confidential memorandum to the US Chamber of Commerce in which he sounded the alarm against socialist, communist and fascist forces that sought to destroy America's free enterprise system. Although a moderate on the Supreme Court, Powell presented a perspective in which college students, liberal professors and the mass media are viewed as responsible for the criticisms of capitalism of the period. Powell's perspective was already evident among libertarians in the 1950s (Libertarian Press 1974). In his memo, Powell set forth a course of action for the Chamber of Commerce that included a multitude of activities and resources: (i) a staff of respected social science faculty, (ii) a staff of speakers who translate the works of the faculty for the public, (iii) a speaker's bureau, (iv) scholars who evaluate social science textbooks for balanced and fair treatment of free enterprise, (v) equal time for speakers on campuses, (vi) balanced faculties on the nation's campuses, (vii) surveillance and monitoring of national television and radio networks, (viii) scholarly journals for independent scholars who promote the free enterprise system, (ix) a mix of publications for the public, (x) paid advertisements promoting the virtues of free enterprise, (xi) direct engagement in the political arena, (xii) a staff of lawyers to influence the judiciary by acting as counsel amicus at the Supreme Court, (xiii) mobilization of stockholders through educational and political action programs, and (xiv) a more aggressive attitude by business leaders to participate in the political arena to promote the free enterprise system and punish those who would oppose it. All of these resources and activities, he urged, should meet standards of accuracy and professional excellence. Powell concluded his memo by arguing that threats to free enterprise are threats to individual freedom and that the nation had moved too far in the direction of state socialism. In retrospect, the shape of neoliberal efforts in this country follows the broad political contours set forth by Powell. Not surprisingly, in 1973, a group of conservative legislators founded the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a non-profit organization which has been a powerful behind-the-scenes player in coordinating the neoliberal policy movement over the past several decades. Supported by major corporations and non-profit organizations, ALEC hosts state and national summits for conservative lawmakers and their supporters to present and advocate for hundreds of model legislative bills often drafted by corporations with the assistance of ALEC staffers. These model bills are then introduced by ALEC legislator "members" in state legislatures across the country (NRDC 2002; Center for Media and Democracy 2013). During the 1999 and 2000 legislative sessions more than 450 "model bills" were enacted into law (NRDC 2002), and 466 were identified in the 2013 legislative agenda targeting the following areas: (i) Voter ID and Stand Your Ground, (ii) wages and worker rights, (iii) public education, (iv) the environment and (v) citizen access to the courts (Center for Media and Democracy 2013). The Powell Memo, Huntington's views and the work of ALEC gave and continue to give concrete direction to the neoliberal movement in this country. As with all social and political movements, there are intellectuals whose works influence movement leaders. As such, the Powell Memo, Huntington's views and the work of ALEC reflect a broader political philosophy and perspective that emphasizes free enterprise, limited government and individual freedom. As a movement, neoliberalism consists of a mix of economic theories and political beliefs and ideologies that have been used to mobilize a policy movement on behalf of the American capitalist class that has shaped social and economic policies for more than four decades (Birch and Tickell 2010; Miller 2010). On the basis of the ideas of von Mises (1951), Hayek (1944), Knight (1946), Friedman (1962), Buchanan and Tullock (1962) and other free market economists (Ronald Coase, Gary Becker, and so on), the economic theories of neoliberalism emphasize monetarism in the shaping of economic policies (Palley 2004). Monetarists seek to control inflation by controlling the supply of money primarily through the setting of interest rates. Monetarism arose as a response to socialism and to Keynesian economics, which had difficulties addressing the problems of stagnation and inflation, or the stagflation that occurred in the early 1970s. Perhaps the work of Allan Greenspan, a monetarist who headed the Federal Reserve for several years before the Great Recession of 2007-2009, best exemplifies efforts to influence the economy by controlling the supply of money. Greenspan was a disciple of the radical conservative novelist, Ayn Rand, who influenced millions of readers with her own neoliberal ideas. Underlying the perspectives of neoliberal economists such as Hayek and Friedman, followers of von Mises (Johnson 1991a), a staunch right-wing libertarian (Libertarian Press 1974), are anti-socialist and anti-collectivist views. . Deregulation was set in motion with the presidency of Jimmy Carter, gained momentum under Ronald Reagan, and has continued to this day (Meeropol 1998; Cooper 2009). Privatization is seen today in charter schools, prisons and detention centers, and many other functions previously carried out by government. A legitimating notion underlying privatization is the view that the market is more efficient and effective than government, a view that is not borne out in education, corrections, public infrastructure and other areas in which privatization has occurred and given rise to corruption (see Project on Government Oversight 2011). It is this principle of neoliberalism, for example, that underlies the attack on tenure in education and public higher education, and which has given rise to the number of adjunct faculty members across the nation. Simply put, the pursuit of group interests is viewed as wrongheaded, with the freedom of individuals maximized when the conditions detailed above prevail. Supposedly, under neoliberal capitalism, those who succeed in amassing wealth do so by creating and operating firms that provide job opportunities for others to do well - in this way, wealth trickles down to those willing to work hard, and the majority of the population benefits. With regard to racial domination and oppression, it is assumed that racism no longer exists and that all individuals are free to pursue their own well-being. There is even speculation of having entered a post-racial period, a view based mostly on the election of President Obama. In recent years, the emphasis has been on promoting color-blind approaches that circumvent intergroup issues. Indeed, from the neoliberal perspective, groups do not exist; they do not have an objective existence, only individuals exist. Thus, within the neoliberal framework, structural inequalities also are assumed to not exist. Supposedly, we live in an open society in which structural barriers such as institutional racism do not exist. Neoliberals, despite being market focused, frequently join forces with cultural reactionaries who are guided by nativistic tendencies and who oppose immigration and the full incorporation of racial and ethnic minorities into the nation's institutions. These views fuse together to support exclusionary policies based on absolutist values that oppose cultural pluralism and multiculturalism and negatively impact Latinos and other historically oppressed groups in the United States. The next section examines the ways by which neoliberalism and neoconservatism have limited the public spaces in which issues of race can be discussed. Race, Neoliberalism and Neoconservatism Although both Democrats and Republicans promote neoliberal policies, Republicans are much more likely to promote views that fuse neoliberal and neoconservative perspectives. The distinction made here between the two is that, while both are authoritarian perspectives, neoliberalism focuses principally on free market fundamentalism and neoconservatism represents cultural reactionary perspectives based on absolutist values used to preserve a national culture that opposes cultural relativism, affirmative action, abortion, gay marriages, and other civil and human rights issues. 2 Neoconservatism is in some ways consistent with and mixes with neoliberalism, especially on anti-taxation and anti-government, with the two movements comprising core elements of the New Right. Both deny the structural nature of American racism, holding that racism exists at the individual level and that individual choice allows individuals to pursue paths that will improve their lot in society. As a result, by promoting color-blind approaches in the various life areas, such as education and employment, individuals are to be treated in accordance with their levels of individual performance and accomplishments. In short, neoliberal views are now codified as law in the arena of education in Arizona, where, according to Tom Horne, former Arizona attorney general and former superintendent of Arizona's Department of Education, one's race is not important in this society; what is important are the skills and personal characteristics of the individual ( Horne v. Martinez 2011). Horne's ally, John Huppenthal, former superintendent of Arizona's Department of Education, who opposes teacher unions and supports charter schools, argues that we are engaged in the "... eternal battle of all time; the forces of collectivism against the forces of individual liberty ... right now in our country we're way out of balance. The forces of collectivism are suffocating us, it's a tidal wave that is threatening our individual liberties, and so we need, at the national level, to rebalance this and we need to make sure that what's going on in our schools rebalances this" (Western Free Press 2012). The denial of institutional racism, according to Robbins (2004, 3), removes racism from "the realm of history, cultural practices, and social relations of power." This perspective has the effect of displacing issues of race and racism from public discourses. Within the orbit of neoliberalism, then, structural inequalities are hidden by attributing the causes to the private and personal spheres (Davis 2007). By separating inequalities from the structural features of society and assigning them to the private sphere, the issue of racism itself is removed from the public sphere. The displacement of racism from the public sphere diminishes the spaces of public discourses in which its elimination can be framed and discussed. The result is the intensification of racial oppression both by making it invisible and by muting resistance by the oppressed. Added to these neoliberal and neoconservative pressures on Latino communities is a powerful assimilationist movement that attacks the cultural pluralism that was partially institutionalized in the sixties. This includes attacks on bilingualism in all sectors, including the voting ballot. This particular emphasis uses exclusion as a means to diminish the influence of the Latino vote and thereby diminishes the values and principles of US democracy.
Washington and Havana agreed "boat people" fleeing Cuba would no longer be guaranteed political asylum in the United States Assured by the American and Cuban Governments that there would be no retribution against them, they were forcibly returned to their homes here. members of the group contend that neither Government has lived up to its obligations. The Cuban Government, they complain, has from the day of their return carried out a campaign of reprisals, intimidation and harassment against them, while the United States has failed to prevent continued violations of the immigration accord the two nations had signed they and several of their relatives had been systematically threatened by State Security agents, arrested on trumped-up charges or accused of working for the C.I.A. All but two are now without jobs because of their political status the pair still employed are regularly harassed by co-workers, bosses or State Security officials American officials have simply brushed aside their complaints There is a conspiracy of self-interest and silence going on between two contending parties, the United States and Cuba, that victimizes these innocent asylum seekers
the white and male vote could still apply no matter how much his administration is perceived as tottering. if the tackle of Trump in the media during his first 100 days hasn’t done it the tipping point may never happen. Republicans may well retain enough of a critical mass of their core voters to hold on to contested congressional districts and Senate seats in 2018 Trump will have more than a fighting chance to replicate his victory in 2020.
According to Lyon, surveillance is the “collection and processing of personal data for the purposes of influencing or managing those whose data have been garnered Surveillance “tries to make visible the identities or the behaviors of people of interest to the agency in question Surveillance encompasses a diverse range of activities and processes concerned with scrutinizing people, their actions, and the spaces they inhabit.
The lights will stay on in the countless laboratories and universities that depend on federal funding for scientific and medical research. That's one upshot of the bipartisan budget deal congressional negotiators reached late Sunday The bill covers funding through September This is welcome news for the research community, which had been shocked and dismayed by Trump's March 16 budget blueprint for fiscal 2018 Science and medical research, however, have long received bipartisan support, and that political reality has not changed under the Trump administration. The new bill includes a small cut to the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fully funded, however, are programs designed to prepare for pandemics or bioterrorism attacks
Japan and the United States cooperate closely in research and development of potential largescale methane hydrate production In light of the transformational potential of eventual large-scale methane hydrate production, we recommend that the United States and Japan accelerate progress on researching and developing cost-effective and environmentally responsible production of methane hydrates. Moreover, the United States and Japan should commit to research and development of alternative energy technologies.
the agricultural sector provides the most substantial and intriguing opportunities for both trade with Cuba and the creation of entirely new businesses in the United States potential for the U.S. agricultural sector is abundantly clear when the sheer volume of Cuba’s agricultural imports are taken into account Cuba imported approximately $1.8 billion in agricultural goods Only approximately 40% of imported agricultural goods were from the United States, leaving over $1 billion of trade going to other countries Cuba is very much in favor ncreased agricultural trade with the United States for the logistical simplicity and cost-savings it would provide Import costs account for as much as 35% of the goods Cuba currently imports from its trading partners. the country is naturally eager to enter into trade relationships that lead to lower transportation costs Rice exports alone present an enormous opportunity for U.S. producers The United States is a major exporter of both processed and unprocessed rice, accounting for 10% of all international trade United States is considered a reliable supplier of a quality product on the international market if the current restrictions on trade were removed, Cuba could potentially exceed Mexico and Japan as the biggest importer of rice grown in the United States. restrictions make it unlikely that import from the United States will go much beyond current levels

Around the time that a record low in Arctic ice was being recorded the UK's House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee urged a halt to all oil and gas drilling in the Arctic The speed at which the Arctic sea ice is melting should be a wake-up call we need to phase out fossil fuels fast Instead we are witnessing a reckless gold rush in this pristine wilderness the race to carve up the Arctic is accelerating faster than our regulatory or technical capacity to manage it record of corporate capitalism shows that powerful industrial forces will do all they can to lobby governments race for corporate profits is now on, with Shell already committed to a "multi-year exploration program" in the Arctic.¶ receding Arctic ice is a "business opportunity Cargo will have a shorter Arctic route, ensuring "efficiency savings Companies are licking their lips at the prospect at getting their hands on vast deposits of minerals as Greenland's ice cap recedes I wouldn't mind if the whole ice cap disappears," said Christiansen we're seeing new places with very attractive geology."¶ A good example of the psychopathic mind-set at the heart of corporate capitalis
Although the research clearly shows that adolescent civic participation promotes civic commitment, the overall trends indicate that the path from adolescent to early adulthood civic engagement is uncertain; service activity in high school has increased over recent decades, while civic engagement among young adults has declined the quality of civic learning experiences may have a greater impact than simply whether or not students were involved in civic activities, suggesting that there is more to civic development than early civic participation Mere participation in civic activity had little impact on students’ ability to analyze to construct personal meaning from the experience
Substantially. A relative and elastic term While it must be employed with care and discrimination, it must, nevertheless, be given effect.”
China’s economic growth has underpinned its strategy and force structure, as well as its rapid rate of military modernization. China’s high rate of economic growth, the size of its GDP have given China the resources to become a major military power with increasingly advanced equipment and technology. If China’s growth continues, its strong economic base, steadily more advanced mix of civil and military technology, and increasingly well-trained and educated workforce will both bolster China’s prestige in the international system and lay the foundation for steady increases in Chinese military power. This makes the future stability and growth of China’s economy a critical underlying factor in assessing its military power. China’s future role as a global power may well be defined more by its growing impact on the global economy. China’s role as a major trading partner and exporter may ultimately give it more influence and leverage Is Becoming an Economic Superpower a Prelude to Becoming a Military Superpower?
strong pull on capitalism in its current monopoly-finance phase to seek out more fossil-fuel intensive forms of production the more deeply it falls into the stagnation trap, resulting in repeated attempts to restart the growth engine by, in effect, giving it more gas. the carbon intensity of world production rose by 0.6 percent. “The economic recovery, where it has occurred, has been dirty.” The notion that a stagnant-prone capitalist growth economy would be even more intensively destructive of the environment was a thesis advanced as early as 1976 by the pioneering Marxist environmental sociologist Anderson. The hope of many that peak crude oil production and the end of cheap oil would serve to limit carbon emissions has also proven false. gas reserves are at least five times the planet’s remaining carbon budget, the signs are that the capitalist system intends to burn it all. Corporations and governments count these carbon resources as financial assets, which means they are intended for exploitation. As bad as the climate crisis is, however, it is important to understand that it is only a part of the larger global ecological crisis—since climate change Ocean acidification, destruction of the ozone layer, species extinction, the disruption of the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, growing fresh water shortages, land-cover change, and chemical pollution all represent global ecological transformations/crises. Already we have crossed the planetary boundaries Species extinction is occurring at about a thousand times the “background rate,” Nitrogen pollution now constitutes a major cause of dead zones in oceans. Other developing planetary rifts, such as ocean acidification (known as the “evil twin” of climate change since it is also caused by carbon emissions), and chronic loss of freshwater supplies, which is driving the global privatization of water, are of growing concern. All of this raises basic questions of survival: the ultimate crisis confronting humanity.
Hei or 黑 means: black. Gui or 鬼means: ghost. If you put them together, they translate into the n-word. a toothpaste called “Darkie,” with a logo of a man in blackface with gleaming white teeth. , was that changing the English name simply absolved westerners of having to see a racial slur on a piece of consumer packaging. In Chinese though, the name stayed the same: “black man’s toothpaste.” Why the name wasn’t changed in the Chinese version is a good question, considering maintaining such a name only serves to reinforce racial stereotypes. Today, I can go into a shop here in Beijing and buy “Black Man” and “Black Sister” toothpastes.  “n-word-oil” or 黑鬼油。The packaging from various manufacturers either had a black man with a rag on his head, with the word “darkie” written underneath his image, an Arab with a black beard, or no human logo at all. What is “n-word-oil”? Well, it turns out that this medicinal remedy is for muscle pain and a host of other ailments Chinese have been using for a very long time. — a tanning oil — also is known as “n-word oil” in Chinese ? It reflects an attitude by some in China that has gone unchecked, because people ignore it since it’s in another language. But racism in any language is worthy of our attention. Africans and African-Americans are coming in increasing numbers to China to do business or to study, and it seems that China can no longer hide behind the fact that this is a medicinal remedy that has existed for over 100 years — that somehow being traditional gets them out of answering a charge on full-on racism. . Amazon.com is one retailer that sells this very product under the direct translation, “black ghost oil.” .

There was a clear sense of disappointment among a certain strand of Trump supporter The anguish came from supporters who latched on to Trump’s “America first” promise during the campaign. Trump’s decision undermined his promise to disentangle the U.S. from global conflicts, saying it reeked of the same old, same old. Donald Bush,” tweeted Cernovich once a staunch supporter of Trump.

Market sentiment over the tepid economic growth may also hamper the yuan from further appreciation,
The inherent mobility of sea power means —modern technology allows global reach dimensions and almost instant operational coordination worldwide. the primary barrier to mobility in crisis-contingency operations is not technological If mobility is to be exercised, ships must actually sail, and it is here—in the commitment of resources to a crisis —that things become culturally problematic before naval forces can be committed to a crisis, a comprehensive legal review is often demanded, something that takes time—time that is usually not available. Another cultural barrier arises from service ethos warships are designed and train to fight. In the modern high-tech era, naval warfare is a very specific proposition It demands very sophisticated and specialized equipment in a shrinking budget environment it is not without a certain politically compelling logic. The effects of these factors are not insignificant. In recent crisis contingencies the arrival of naval vessels was delayed while legal and operational impact issues were addressed 20 Bureaucratic reasons, not materiel, were the culprits, ultimately to the detriment of the response Hesitancy can be fatal in an operation requiring rapid response
This vote, though, to replace half of the 242-seat house, is being seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ambitious economy policy. Dubbed "Abenomics", it was designed to help drag the world’s third biggest economy out of a two-decade deflationary spiral. It will also determine whether or not Abe will be able to push ahead with his cherished goal of revising the pacifist constitution - a huge departure from traditional post-war thinkin would constitute a source of even larger concerns - not only to a majority of the public in Japan, but also to neighbours such as China and South Korea, who still vividly remember atrocities committed by Japan in the first half of the the last century.

Chinese ship, Haixun 01, had detected electronic pulse signals in the Indian Ocean related to MH370 a series of sounds have been detected by a Chinese ship in the search area. The characteristics reported are consistent with the aircraft black box. A number of white objects were also sighted on the surface about 90 kilometres from the detection area The RCC in Australia has spoken to the RCC in China and asked for any further information that may be relevant. "The deployment of RAAF assets to the area where the Chinese ship detected the sounds is being considered.
Trump's initiatives that has drawn the ire of conservatives is his desire to push through infrastructure spending that it was necessary to "prime the pump" and "spend money to make a lot more money." Keynesian theory is predicated on the notion that artificially increasing demand by opening the spigots of the federal government and allowing money to rain down on the economy will somehow magically solve the country's economic woes. The flaw in this theory is the idea that money cannot simply appear out of thin air; in actuality the money has to be taken from elsewhere in the economy, "whether through increased taxes, increased borrowing, or increased inflation," "All of those drain an equivalent amount of resources from the private sector, leaving no net increase for the economy, if not a net, effective loss," The government does not add value to the economy. It removes value from the economy by imposing taxes on one citizen and providing cash to another. Or it borrows money that would otherwise be used by investors and redistributes it elsewhere. Or it prints more money and threatens the value of the dollar. Nothing is stimulated. Spending power is not increased. politicians and bureaucrats are substituting their uninformed, largely political decisions for those of the marketplace.
it is far from plausible that the U.S. strategic commitment to the defense of Europe and the transatlantic ties forged during and after World War II can be replaced by negotiations over marine equipment safety standards, arguments about subsidies to Boeing and Airbus, and complaints about French restrictions on U.S. television shows. But these claims are made; they are taken seriously; and they form, on the EU side, a central reason for the EU’s enthusiasm for a TTIP. The U.S. view of a TTIP is somewhat different. The TTIP is , a bone thrown to the EU by an Administration that is not particularly interested in the region The EU’s enthusiasm for a TTIP is misguided. The EU is being bought off cheaply
Contemporary psychoanalytic notions of bisexuality rely on a number of grossly outdated theoretical assumptions, biological sex gender and object choice imply each other and are virtually synonymous; (2) sexuality develops in a linear fashion from undifferentiated bi-sexuality to a differentiated mono-sexuality (3) disharmonious gender identity signifies psychopathology the concept of bisexuality is used in roughly the same ways today as it was in Freud’s lifetime the psychoanalytic concept of bisexuality is overly theoretical; postulated as a universal, essential human quality Although the role of bisexuality as the bedrock of psychoanalytic theory remains unquestioned, there exists “relatively little analytic data on bisexuality The current situation with regards to psychoanalytic theorizing on bisexuality is reminiscent of what happened earlier with homosexuality heterosexual analysts were the ones writing about homosexuality, of which they had no firsthand knowledge, while those experiencing homosexual lifestyles had no voice . It was only when gay- and lesbian-identified analysts were finally able to voice their ideas that the questioning of inaccurate and pathologizing psychoanalytic notions of homosexuality could begin , to initiate the process of change in the psychoanalytic thinking on bisexuality, it is vital that bi-identified analytic practitioners make themselves heard, critiquing the theory on its own premises and offering viable alternative conceptualizations To counteract the century-old tradition of relegating bisexuality into the mythical past experience-near theorizing should focus on later experiences, which can be clearly remembered rather than deduced bisexuality research produced outside of psychoanalysis in psychology and social sciences needs to be inserted into psychoanalytic theory and rearticulated bisexuality can be reinstated at the center of psychoanalytic theory not as a vague archaic concept but as a transformative practice In the meantime, psychoanalytically oriented bi-friendly clinicians and writers are advised to adapt a critical stance toward psychoanalytic ideas

Thousands of job applicants have their hopes dashed because they’ve failed their polygraph tests. The FBI’s policy of barring job candidates who fail their polygraph tests clashes with the view of many scientists that government agencies shouldn’t be relying on polygraph testing to decide whether to hire or fire someone Experts say polygraph testing isn’t a reliable indicator of whether someone is lying – especially in employment screening. little-known technical glitch in one of the leading polygraphs that the bureau have used could give applicants who fail polygraphs even more reason to assert that they were inaccurately and unfairly labeled liars. polygraph testing is especially prone to inaccuracies because the questions are often more vague than they are in criminal investigations and therefore they’re more likely to provoke reactions from the innocent that might seem like deception. According to records, the bureau has at least a 30 percent failure rate in its job screening. As many as 40 percent of special agent applicants don’t get the job because of their polygraph test results.
China‘s new custodial functions in buttressing the global economic system in ways that are currently unmatched by any other state. The first concerns Beijing‘s purchase of Euro bonds Beijing used the opportunity to negotiate several important trade agreements and to consolidate major bilateral ties across a broad range of issues. China now regularly links its financial support to broader economic and political issues. The second example of China‘s new custodial role concerns its efforts to institute domestic reforms intended to help redress global economic imbalances. This growing distortion in balances between China, Europe and the US on the one hand, and those involving the rest of the world on the other, led to a greater policy focus on China and the United States in the aftermath of the Great Recession Fundamental to this problem has been the US‘ unprecedented levels of government, private and corporate debt, coupled with low savings rates and declining exports This behavior stands in stark to their Chinese counterparts
interpretation assumes nuclear war would be the big whoosh—a flash of global cataclysm in which everything disappears instantly and painlessly lure of instantaneous extinction is pervasive in symbolic perceptions of the Bomb there is little likelihood that the end would be so simple for everyone examine the reality of symbolism the common perception of nuclear war is likely to be the myth of the big whoosh ordinary forms of suicide must stand as prototypes of acute generalized total self-destruction the appeal of extinction, even without an expectation of rebirth, is fundamentally positive suicides are drawn to intensify their situation—to take the apparently irreversible situation of anomie and make a virtue of its necessity by carrying it to its ultimate conclusion in perfect chaos In the fantasied big whoosh of suicide all the many faceted attractions of transcending structure and dissolving in the limitless combine, luring the suicide to one final act of merger with the “all.” Similarly, the Bomb offers the hope of one last moment of cosmic empowerment in the instant of global extinction. nuclear weapons offer themselves as the most appealing solution to the very problems they have created, having led us to equate death with utter annihilation—having made us feel “dead in life”—they urge us to transcend this state the vast majority of us do not seek out empirical knowledge of what nuclear war might be we avoid such knowledge. It is much more appealing to rest content with the myth of the big whoosh the end of civilization,” “the end of human life,” or even “the destruction of the planet” roll off our tongues easily. Is this not because we are in awe of such a possibility, fascinated as well as terrified, in the same way that we are drawn and simultaneously repelled by our own self-annihilation through transcendence These are the deeply buried symbolic images that seduce us into following the Bomb down the path to the martyrdom of mutual suicide

Many large American shipping lines like the American President Lines are leaving U.S. flags and are becoming FOC ships. This comes to 51.3% of the world's gross tonnage carried on FOC ships.

Putting a price on carbon is essential for success in the international response to climate change, Without a price, recognizing and charging for the damaging effects of emitting greenhouse gases, efforts to address climate change will be inefficient and likely too slow to avoid its worst effects.

whaling opponents have relied on colonialist or even racist arguments to develop opposition to the Makah whale hunt. These arguments follow themes that have existed since colonial times to maintain unequal power relationships between native and non-native peoples. Native American political activity must be “incited” by outsiders because they cannot act by themselves. Whaling opponents ave frequently suggested that the Japanese are responsible for the Makah whale hunt. The only Japanese involvement in west coast whaling has been a $20,000 start-up grant for a Nuu-chah-nulth whaling organization, the World Council of Whalers. The Makah are not members of this organization Watson has not even accorded the Makah the status of co-conspirators in his chess match, instead drawing directly on an image of the Makah as a passive people easily manipulated by non-natives. This contradicts the statements of many Makah people, including Makah opponents of the hunt, about the importance of whaling and the reasons the Makah desire to hunt  Whaling opponents have extended their arguments about subsistence versus commercial whaling by speaking of a division between the Makah into “traditional” and “assimilated” camps. They suggest that Makah traditionalists oppose the hunt as something non-traditional, while the tribal council reputedly wants the hunt only for its economic potential though the tribe is divided over whaling, pro-whalers are in control of the tribal government. Opposition to whaling includes tribal elders the failure to note that elders also support the hunt clearly intends to feed into romantic stereotypes about “traditional” versus “assimilated” Indians Whaling opponents have also opposed the hunt by suggesting that Makah cultural aspirations are “inauthentic,” usually in the process of telling the Makah what their culture was, is or ought to be. “I really doubt that [the Makah’s] ancestors would respect this modern day version of whale hunting,” one woman writes. This kind of romantic condemnation has been common historically in colonialist discourse about Native Americans. This opponent of the Makah hunt dismisses what the Makah say about themselves and their own experiences as if she possessed superior knowledge about the values and motivations of Native Americans. . Another favorite theme among animal rights activists is the assumption that technological change demonstrates the cultural assimilation of indigenous peoples. Speaking of the Makah, one whale tour operator writes: If they are so hell bent on going back to their roots, why the hell do they insist on: driving cars, using internal combustion engines, fibreglass, aluminum, roads, shopping centres, all the other stuff that has improved their lives since the coming of the “White Man. the Makah are told their modernity “proves” they are no longer “authentically” Makah. the Makah have a right to perpetuate their culture, adapting it to meet new needs The Makah should not have to choose between putting their culture under glass, or abandoning it entirely in order to participate in American society and the world economy. Whaling opponents often explain that the Makah must accept the “progress” and “evolution” of society. By this they mean the Makah must accept the forced end of whaling as the “natural” outcome of “social evolution” along with fibreglass and shopping centers
. Chinese complaints of US internet hegemony are not completely unfounded: the internet reinforces US dominance, but it does so through a light regulatory touch that relies on the self-interest of stakeholders The profit-driven expansion of networks and markets through more reliable and voluminous transactions and more innovative products Western observers fear that cyber reform based on the principle of internet sovereignty might legitimize authoritarian control and undermine the cosmopolitan promise of the multistakeholder system. China, however, benefits too much from the current system to pose a credible alternative. Tussles around internet governance are more likely to result in minor change at the margins of the existing system, not a major reorganization that shifts technical protocols and operational regulation to the United Nations.

Alongside the deep and powerful Fatalism model, informants applied an understanding that current immigration problems can be addressed and improved by taking a problemsolving approach and pragmatically putting differences aside to come up with real solutions to immigration issues. Moreover, they viewed this system as something which could and should be improved through a “step by step” process focused on solving current problems. This deep understanding of the importance and power of “rolling up our sleeves” to solve problems is a foundational model informants adopted a pragmatic perspective on the immigration system — seeing the system as one that serves a purpose and can, and should, be changed to better achieve its important function.
Obama’s surprise announcement that he will ask Congress for approval of a military attack on Syria is being hailed as a vindication of the rule of law and a revival of the central role of Congress in war-making, even by critics. all of this is wrong.

despite the emergence of ‘New Social Movements’ and governments willing to question mainstream ‘fundamentals’ or reject the whole neo-liberal doctrine . It may also be argued that the leaders of the ‘Pink Tide’, are potential recruits for a new modified form of neo-liberalism as proposed by reformist globalisers rather like the Labour Party in the UK, the use of a ‘soft left’ option to repackage the neo-liberal agenda, and disarm and undermine potentially radical forces In Brazil, for instance, despite some radical posturing by Lula, inequality has increased during the period he has been in office sections of the reformist ‘Pink Tide’ may be falling in line with the kind of policy shift envisaged by the World Bank, which, in the case of Mexico, The policies of these governments also seem to be more responsive to, and in tune with, popular demands in the region

Response” here is meant to include governmental and industry policy changes as well as individual citizens‘ understanding of the need for “lifestyle” changes; Observing that politicians and the public were equally ready to declare the spill “over” as their perception of the disaster-as-image was successfully resolved the visual images effectively shape the response that we make, as a society and as individuals. our response is largely an effect of the visual imagery that conveys the reality of the disaster, the media spectacle that doubles up the empirical event This dimension—event as information—constitutes the determining level of reality important aspects of the oil spill are not easily visualized by existing technologies, and thus are left “out of the picture” of the disaster that shapes public opinion and political response If policy makers and the public were adequately informed about these not-yet-visualized aspects, we may assume, our response would be very different: we might not be so ready to declare the spill over as soon as the oil slicks are effectively removed from the visible surfaces of the ocean. it is due to certain technological limits or lacunae that the picture of disaster formed and disseminated via visual images is necessarily incomplete—and thus subject to distortion or manipulation: “That we have yet to develop or popularize certain kinds of technologies of vision produces specific invisibilities that fit well with corporate policy. No picture, no action.”
In order to try to show that the U.S. Navy is insufficient in the face of future threats, Kaplan argues that we on are our way to “a 150 ship navy the current 250-plus ship force has fewer ships than it did two decades ago, but the ships it has are far more capable than those of the 1980s Because of the collapse of its competitors, the Navy is relatively more capable of fighting and winning wars now than it was during the Reagan administration the U.S. Navy can destroy any naval challengers The Navy has arrived at an ideal compromise keeping its fighting supremacy while leading and facilitating cooperation around the world on maritime issues
’structural violence’ and ’positive peace’. They are metaphors rather than models, and for that very reason are suspect. Metaphors always imply models and metaphors have much more persuasive power than models do, for models tend to be the preserve of the specialist. But when a metaphor implies a bad model it can be very dangerous, for it is both persuasive and wrong. The metaphor of structural violence I would argue falls right into this category The implication is that poverty and its associated ills are the fault of the thug or the conqueror and the solution is to do away with thugs and conquerors. While there is some truth in the metaphor, in the modem world at least there is not very much. Violence, whether of the streets and the home, or of the guerilla, of the police, or of the armed forces, is a very different phenomenon from poverty. The processes which create and sustain poverty are not at all like the processes which create and sustain violence, although like everything else in the world, everything is somewhat related to everything else. There is a very real problem of the structures which lead to violence, but unfortunately Galtung’s metaphor of structural violence as he has used it has diverted attention from this problem. Violence in the behavioral sense, is a ’threshold’ phenomenon The study of the structures which underlie violence are a very important and much neglected part of peace research and indeed of social science in general. Threshold phenomena like violence are difficult to study because they represent ’breaks’ in the system rather than uniformities. Violence, whether between persons or organizations, occurs when the ’strain’ on a system is too great for its ‘~s~trength’. The metaphor here is that violence is like what happens when we break a piece of chalk. Strength and strain, however, especially in social systems, are so interwoven historically that it is very difficult to separate them. The diminution of violence involves two possible strategies, or a mixture of the two; one is the increase in the strength of the system, ~the other is the diminution of the strain. The strength of systems involves habit, culture, taboos, and sanctions, all these things, which enable a system to stand Increasing strain without breaking down into violence. The strains on the system are largely dynamic in character, such as arms races, mutually stimulated hostility, changes in relative economic position or political power, which are often hard to identify is only perceptions of interest which affect people’s behavior, not the ’real’ interests, whatever these may be, and the gap between perception and reality can be very large and resistant to change. However, what Galitung calls structural violence (which has been defined by one unkind commentator as anything that Galltung doesn’~t like) was originally defined as any unnecessarily low expectation of life, an that assumption that anybody who dies before the allotted span has been killed, however unintentionally and unknowingly, by somebody else. The concept has been expanded to include all the problems off poverty, destitution, deprivation, and misery. These are enormously real and are a very high priority for research and action, but they belong to systems which are only peripherally related to the structures which, produce violence. This is not to say that the cultures of violence and the cultures of poverty are not sometimes related But the dynamics of poverty and the success or failure to rise out off ’it are of a complexity far beyond anything which the metaphor of structural violence can offer. While the metaphor of structural violence performed a ’service in calling attention to a problem, it may have done a disservice in preventing us from finding the answer

The Horn of Africa is one of the most strategically critical regions in the world with Bab el-Mandeb, being a potential choke point for much of the worlds commerce. Almost all of the trade between the European Union and China, Japan, India and the rest of Asia passes through the Bab el-Mandeb everyday. Up to 30% of the worlds oil, including all of the oil and natural gas from the Persian Gulf heading west passes through the Horn of Africa daily. Who controls the Horn of Africa controls a major chunk of the worlds economies How long would the EU economies be able to hold out without the energy supplies from the Persian Gulf or the vital Asian imports? The USA, still the world’s lone superpower, has a policy of using local enforcers to do its dirty work in areas of the world of critical importance to its interests. he who controls Bab el-Mandeb has his fingers around the throats of both the EU and Asia’s economies Choke Point Bab el-Mandeb is strategically critical in today’s world The day the USA loses control of the Bab el-Mandeb may very well mark the end of the USA’s days as the worlds lone superpower and it’s control of the world as we know it

WASHINGTON  people  tell the American people that U.S. strikes  were necessary to disrupt imminent attack plotting They warned that members of an al-Qaida offshoot were nearing the execution phase of an attack  People may have come away with the impression that the terror group was on the brink of pulling off something awful imminent attack plotting doesn't necessarily mean an attack is imminent Careful parsing of the language reveals a distinction between imminent plotting and an imminent attack an imminent threat doesn't necessarily mean an imminent attack in the view of the government there's more than one meaning for imminent An 'imminent' threat of violent attack against the United States does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future officials say they can't wait until preparations for a terrorist act are completed before they take action to defend U.S. In the case of the Khorasan Group officials told the AP that U officials aren't aware of the terrorists identifying any attack in the near future The plans were far enough along that the T S A banned uncharged mobile phones and laptops from flights to the U.S. that originate in Europe and the Middle East Kerry said Levin described The briefings we had indicated that there was a growing ability, near ability to put together an explosive device which could get through the security at airports and that's all And they were at a point told the AP that the government was concerned that the group could go underground after the AP reported that it was a top U A bulletin from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued Tuesday said U.S. officials had "no indicators of advanced al-Qaida or ISIL plotting in the homeland."

In time of capitalist crisis with declining economic wealth there is no basis for sharing wealth – even unequally – between capitalist, bankers, creditors and workers, debtors and rentiers The ruling class strikes back with all the forces – state and private – at its disposal to ensure that its financial needs are met . Ruling class warfare defines who pays for the crisis and who benefits from the ‘recovery … of profits’. The crisis is , a temporary threat to the capitalist economic system and then, in the course of recovering from the crisis, a political economic and social pretext for a ruling class general offensive aimed at reversing labor and social advances over the past half century: Capitalist class warfare dismantles the social safety net and undermines the entire legal and ideological underpinnings of ‘welfare capitalism’. ‘Austerity’ is the chosen term to mark the ruling class’ seizure of the public treasury on its own behalf – without any regard for its social consequences. ‘Austerity’ is the highest form of class struggle from above because it establishes the arbitrary and unilateral power of capital to decide the present and future division between wages and profits and principal payments of neo-colonial debtor states As crisis deepens among debtor nations so does the ruling class intensify its class war The organizations of the workers are ill-prepared to confront the open and aggressive all-out war of the ruling class. Their parties with dual loyalties to capitalist profits and social welfare, are deeply embedded in the capitalist order Under pressure of ‘the crisis’, they abandoned labor and embraced the formulae of the ruling class, imposing their own versions of ‘austerity’. Labor was abandoned; the working classes were on their own class struggle from below lacks the leadership, vision, organization and state resources, which the ruling class possesses, to launch a counter-offensive. The fundamental problem in the ongoing class struggle is that the trade unions and many workers failed to recognize the changing nature of the class struggle: The ‘total war strategy’, adopted by the ruling class, went far beyond pay raises and profit reports and embraced a frontal attack on the living, working, housing, pension, health and educational conditions of labor. The politics of ‘social pacts’ between labor and capital was totally discarded by the ruling class .It demanded unconditional surrender of all social demands and seized the executive prerogatives of the state to enforce and implement the massive re-concentration of income and political power.
a new economic scandal is taking shape in the U S We just got even more evidence supporting the theory that charter schools are America’s new subprime mortgages The OIG) released the results of a damning audit of the charter school industry which found that charter schools’ relationships with their management organizations pose a significant risk to the aim of the Department of Education The findings echo the findings of a 2015 study that warned of an impending bubble similar to that of the subprime-mortgage crisis : “There is a never-ending stream of charter scandals coming from California more than 20 percent of all California charter schools have enrollment policies that violate state and federal law the largest for-profit charter operator in the country, has ‘a dismal record of academic achievement’ but has won more than $310 million in state funding over the past dozen years billions of taxpayer dollars are being diverted from the nation’s public schools to charter schools and with those funds has come a growing crisis of so-called education entrepreneurs who are using some of those scarce public funds to line their own pockets With minimal oversight and regulation, the charter school scandals will grow until elected and appointed policymakers take dramatic action to overhaul the country’s charter school system and demand greater accountability from those involved

there is the original interpretation of the CS, also known as the “linguistic approach” that argues that an actor can transform an object into a security threat by discursively framing it in security terms securitization occurs through the issuing of “speech acts” that highlight the existential nature of a given issue and call for the use of extraordinary means to counter such threat ( is possible to identify a “sociological approach”, which emerged as a reaction to the CS's proposal that securitization is a process solely associated to language OC first became the object of serious political and academic debate in the USA in the It was mainly regarded as a growing economic problem, stemming from the existence of public demand for illegal goods. This economic perspective would, however, quickly be replaced by a security one in the 1940s and 1950s, with OC being identified with immigrant-dominated groups, whose goal was understood as the corruption of society: “the tentacles of organized crime reach into virtually every community throughout the country” change was very visible in public discourse, with the emphasis on reforming society being substituted with the need for stronger law enforcement and the imagery of warfare against OC Between the 1930s and the 1960s, it was possible to observe, in the USA, a securitization of OC, which would lead to its labelling as a very serious security threat, “a serious menace which […] could wreck the very foundation of this country” Such securitization process, taking the American society and values as its referent object, would eventually lead to the creation of special governmental bodies: “everywhere throughout the country citizens, […] have risen up to demand greater vigilance in stamping out crime and corruption
No single strategy will generate 1 million additional undergraduate STEM degrees over the next decade, because the challenge has many dimensions Therefore the recommendations presented here address various stakeholders and use both tangible resources and persuasion to inspire and catalyze change in undergraduate STEM education By attacking the issue from a number of angles with various tools, including public exhorta­ tion, faculty incentives, resources, information, and institutional connections, the concerted forces can reach a point at which the movement takes on a momentum of its own and leads to sweeping change we propose promoting change with actions that address diverse students, faculty, departments, institutional leadership, industrial interests, and professional societies.68 Our recommendations aim to overcome many barriers, from lack of faculty time for studying the education literature to the inability of students to re­enter college after they take a break from their education
Education as a form of acculturation has come to be defined as the acquisition of social and human capital. This process depends on increases in knowledge in the workforce at large. Education has become instrumental to business values. Profit-making operations dominate the world, increasingly also in the world of education There is a tendency not only to reconstitute schools and universities as corporations and to manage their affairs along business lines (Rustin, 2016:154). Welch (1998:171) concludes that the neoliberal approach to education could be seen as an effort towards "a broader reshaping of the social order" The key elements of the education reform package are embedded in three interrelated policy technologies: the market, managerialism and performativity. When employed together, these technologies offer a politically attractive alternative to the state-centred, public welfare tradition of educational provision ( Education "reform" of this type is spreading across the world like a "policy epidemic" in "diverse and social locations which have very different histories" (Ball, 2003:215; compare the remark above about the different guises in which neoliberalism has appeared across the world). These aspects of reform engender what Lyotard (1984:216) referred to as the "terror of performativity". As Foucault (1979:294) averred, the purpose of performativity and the concomitant neoliberal educational reform was to "produce bodies that are docile and capable" It is therefore important to understand that neoliberal precepts only reign supreme at schools and universities whose management echelons have fully bought in on neoliberal principles.
overwhelming majority of states require no attention to diversity and integration by their charter schools for charter schools to receive and maintain a charter of the forty-one jurisdictions allowing charter schools, only twelve pay some sort of statutory attention to integration. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia make no mention of either diversity or integration. Even the states requiring some attention to student demographics have limited enforcement measures A South Carolina charter school running afoul of the racial standard need only prove that the school is not ―operating in a racially discriminatory manner Nevada requires the integration only if practicable state legislation treats all students alike in terms of admission and outreach efforts. Given the differences by race and class embedded in choice, treating everyone alike almost guarantees segregative outcomes even states with racial balancing provisions have segregated charter schools The disconnect between charter school legislation promoting racial balance and the practice of segregation is not new the reality of charter school operations contradicts legislative racial balancing provisions, suggesting their ineffectiveness and meaninglessness
the term engagement is understood as a positive foreign policy strategy, which depends to a significant degree on positive incentives the engaging strategy does not preclude the simultaneous use of negative instruments, such as sanctions or military force, but in order to be understood as engaging strategy the use of positive incentives should play leading role Even though some negative means might be used engagement means generally a conflict preventing approach which can be understood as use of positive methods to cooperate
One of the scariest ideas is the possibility that technological progress is petering out. Without it, there can be no long-run economic expansion Modern societies and economies are built on the assumption of growth The return to a zero-sum world could bring back the constant warfare and strife that prevailed in the distant past if the only way for people to prosper was at other people’s expense The most ominous possibility is that new scientific and technological ideas are simply getting harder to find The scary idea is that easy-to-discover technology is a finite, exhaustible resource. You can derive some of the basic laws of physics You can deduce the idea of biological inheritance But to develop lithium-ion batteries, invasive neurotechnology, or gene therapy requires hundreds or thousands of researchers Once the universe’s low-hanging fruit has been picked, it takes ever more money and power to pick the next bushel. That daunting prospect has received support from economists Bloom They look at several areas in fields and find that while steady progress continues, keeping it going has required an ever-increasing army of researchers the economy-wide numbers are discouraging. That the number of researchers keeps increasing while productivity stagnates suggests that the old veins of technological progress are being mined out faster than the rich new veins are being discovered

, we focus on using economic conditions to understand when rivalries are likely to escalate or end when confronted with domestic problems, leaders have the clear alternatives of escalating the conflict to divert or settle as a means of freeing up substantial resources that can be directed toward solving internal problems Conflict settlement is  a distinct route to dealing with internal problems that leaders in rivalries may pursue when faced with internal problems Military competition requires large amounts of resources Leaders may choose to negotiate a settlement that ends a rivalry to free up important resources In a “guns versus butter” world of economic trade-offs, when a state can no longer afford to pay the expenses associated with competition in a rivalry, it is quite rational for leaders to reduce costs by ending a rivalry. This gain could be achieved at any time  However, such a gain is likely to be most important and attractive to leaders when internal conditions are bad and the leader is seeking ways to alleviate active problems. Support for policy change away from continued rivalry is more likely to develop when the economic situation sours and elites and masses are looking for ways to improve a worsening situation. It is at these times that the pressure to cut military investment will be greatest and that state leaders will be forced to recognize the difficulty of continuing to pay for a rivalry Poor economic conditions increase the probability of rivalry termination.
it is acknowledged by most economists that RTAs have actively contributed to lowering of trade barriers globally over the past few decades implicitly confirming that RTAs have created an effective ‘‘learning process’’ for emerging countries in favouring integration and gradual openness RTAs have also often been able to bring measures other than purely ‘‘border-related’’ barriers into countries’ liberalization agendas, including noneconomic fields of cooperation often excluded from multilateral negotiations these factors facilitate objectively economic development regionalism has evolved in a generally favourably way over the past two decades, facilitating processes of economic liberalization
Latin America's economic growth and political stability are driving an unprecedented power shift within the region. Instead of looking to Washington for guidance, Latin American countries are increasingly working among themselves to conduct diplomacy Brazil's emergence as a serious power is a direct result of the increasing absence of U.S. influence in the region. Sensing an opportunity to gain the regional stature that has long eluded it, the country has begun to act more assertively. But complicating Brazil's power play is the reaction from its fellow Latin American nations. Brazil's responses to developments such as Chavez's ongoing assault on Venezuela's democracy and even the 2009 coup in Honduras have undermined its credibility as a serious leader. Many Latin American officials quietly reveal that they are not eager to see Brazil replace the United States as the hemisphere's hegemon. As one diplomat recently put it, "The new imperialists have arrived, and they speak Portuguese." Yet Brazil is learning that leadership means responsibility. Colombian leaders are also aware of the shifting balance of power within Latin America. Latin America comes into its own, it is beginning to rely more on its own multilateral bodies. Brazil helped create the Union of South American Nations, or unasur, which Brazilian leaders quietly hope will replace the oas as the default regional body in South America. unasur has prioritized regional integration and solidarity over promoting democratic practices. And much to the chagrin of some in Brasília, the oas demonstrated its importance when it helped coordinate the regional diplomatic response following the coup in Honduras in 2009, an effort that likely staved off even greater strife in the country. The seemingly moribund organization has shown some surprisingly gritty determination, but there is new competition in the neighborhood.

Cooperative federalism is "a system in which... divided authority is brought together again" in a way that "enables the cooperating governments to benefit from one another's special capacities while still preserving the value of political pluralism." scholar in the field of environmental policy recently described the "operative" principle of cooperative federalism as follows: "the federal government establishes a policy.., and then enlists the aid of the states, through a combination of carrots, such as financial aid, and sticks, such as the imposition of constraints.., through federal regulation, in pursuing that policy IDEA fits squarely within this model by leaving to the states the "primary responsibility for developing and executing educational programs for handicapped children," while imposing "significant requirements to be followed in the discharge of that responsibility" as a pre-requisite for federal financial assistance

War involving significant fractions of the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals , could have globally catastrophic effects such as severely reducing food production for years,1 potentially leading to collapse of modern civilization worldwide and even the extinction of humanity Nuclear war between the United States and Russia could occur by various routes, including accidental or unauthorized launch and inadvertent attack system safeguards or procedures to maintain control over nuclear weapons fail in such a way that a nuclear weapon or missile launches without direction from leaders nuclear strategy was aimed primarily at minimizing risks of intentional attack through development of deterrence capabilities , concerns about the extreme disruptions that a first attack would cause in the 1 other side’s forces and command-and-control capabilities led to both sides’ development of capabilities to detect a first attack and launch a counter-attack before suffering damage from the first attack False indicators of nuclear attack could be caused in several ways terrorist groups might cause attacks on either the United States or Russia that resemble some kind of nuclear attack by the other nation by actions such as exploding a stolen or improvised nuclear bomb,10 especially if such an event occurs during a crisis between the United States and Russia.11 A variety of nuclear terrorism scenarios are possible.12 Al Qaeda has sought to obtain or construct nuclear weapons and to use them against the United States. Other methods could involve attempts to circumvent nuclear weapon launch control safeguards or exploit holes in their security.

“The ‘pakistanization’ of Turkey.” it is hard to see Turkey as the economic and the democratically prosperous country it once was. Rather, with continued terrorist violence, many now question whether Turkey under the AKP is becoming a fragmented and semi failed state.  The nation’s economy, which had languished for decades, was radically transformed by a comprehensive neo-liberal economic agenda that heralded robust economic growth. This growth, in step with continued political reform, eventually saw Turkey mentioned as an unlikely candidate for EU membership. Not so anymore. Rather, recent times have seen Turkey’s star begin to fade, with the state slipping slowly into authoritarian rule. And despite boasting one of Europe’s best airlines, its once-vibrant tourist industry is in tatters, particularly since a series of terrorist attacks and policy blunders have seen Turkey becoming isolated, both regionally and internationally. More recently, however, the shooting down of a Russian jet has seen Russia and Turkey pursue the start of a possible ‘hot’ war, with no end in sight to the seething animosity that has developed between the two. A growing Kurdish proto-state – which Moscow now supports – adds another dangerous dimension to the rivalry. With security efforts focused on dissidents – especially given the broadening definition of what constitutes a ‘terrorist’ – there has been a lack of internal security when it has come to capturing potential PKK and ISIS terrorists. The recent bombings by TAK (a splinter faction of the PKK) have shown that the government’s war against the PKK can be brought to Western Turkey. Unless Ankara implements drastic changes, including consistent efforts by the government in bringing about domestic stability, there is the distinct possibility of Turkey becoming another casualty in an increasingly unstable region.
Introduction Like other forms of debate, Cross-Examination (C-X or Policy) Debate focuses on the core elements of controversial issue. Debate develops important skills, such as critical thinking, listening, argument construction, research, note-taking and advocacy skills. , Cross-Examination Debate typically rewards intensive use of evidence, and is more focused on content than on delivery. he topic for Cross-Examination (Policy) Debate is typically called a "resolution" or "proposition." olicy propositions tend to be the most common. So that clash might occur in a debate, debaters should engage in research on both sides of the topic. Research is primarily the job of debaters One team takes the affirmative position and is responsible for defending and supporting the resolution The affirmative team is responsible for the initial interpretation of the resolution, and for presenting a case that defends and supports the resolution. The negative team may challenge this interpretation if they believe the affirmative team's interpretation is unreasonable The objective of the affirmative team is to construct and present a case that defends and supports the resolution. Arguing Against the Resolution The objective of the negative team is to refute the affirmative case, which, by extension, is an argument against the resolution.
When comparing the economics of technologies, based on policy portfolios crafted to address GHG emissions, RET options will become increasingly favorable as extractive fuels and energy begin to reflect the cost of carbon when compared with the costs of RET — particularly when compounded with technical and learning cost decreases of RETs themselves research is needed to understand how to continue to optimize the use of RET resources, including more sophisticated understanding of the systems-level integration across power, fuels, land use, transportation, and energy demand. future innovations in global financing mechanisms work to align fiscal resources with RET development much the way 20th century infrastructure was supported in Europe and the United States GHG emissions associated with energy extraction and use are a major component of any strategy addressing climate change mitigation. Renewable energy technologies have been accelerating rapidly during the past decades, both in technology performance and cost-competitiveness — and they are increasingly gaining market share. These technology options offer many positive attributes, but also have unique cost/benefit trade-offs, such as land-use competition for bioresources and variability for wind and solar electric generation technologies. Given the growing interest and use in RETs as a viable short- and long-term option for limiting future climate change, key issues that need to be addressed for increased use of RETs include: • Continued innovation. For most RETS, costs remain high compared to fossil fuel alternatives. Many RETs are relatively immature technically and are poised for further cost and performance improvements Policy frameworks. To integrate RETs into the energy system, it is key to include portfolio approaches that address key issues such as comprehensive and comparable cost/benefit of all energy options, provision of stable and predictable policy environments, and transitional pathways as broader climate related legislation and agreements are developed • Improved analysis capabilities. Evaluating RETs in energy systems is especially important as transport electrification accelerates.
economic crisis has an empirical basis in factual events and economic statistics, but is also a social construct refers to the worldwide recession of 2007–2008, changed economic circumstances and investors’ outlooks and caused governments to nationalize and/or invest in failing banks and to stimulate the economy inter alia through bail outs, expansion of the money supply and low interest rates. changed the lives of many made many observers much more critical about capitalism and the stability of markets, ). In Europe, the economic crisis was accompanied by a debt banking and euro crisis, all interrelated refer to different empirical phenomena perception and representation of such phenomena in crisis terms can give scope for motivating and/or justifying responses.
NOT so long ago, observers were agog at the sheer quantities of materials produced by China’s miracle economy But the days of double-digit economic growth are over, and many basic industries have ended up with massive overcapacity. As more and more of that spare capacity finds its way on to the world market, it looks likely to fuel a protectionist backlash grant China “market economy” status would make it harder to hold back the tide of Chinese imports A trade war may be brewing
there are some important challenges that would appear to hinder the future development of Russian-Chinese relations. Russia has failed to complete the turn to the East. economic cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is not advancing , evidenced by the lack of Chinese investment in Russia and the significant decrease of the trade turnover between the two countries. Russia-China trade dropped from about $88 billion to almost $64 billion between 2014 and 2015 In comparison, China’s trade with Europe and the U.S. has been robustly increasing for the last three years. some Chinese experts question Russia’s approaches of doing business. Russia and China are lacking cooperation in the field of small and medium-sized business the model of China-Russia cooperation is outdated, with Russia exporting raw materials like gas and oil and China providing manufactured goods. China’s level of investment is not increasing because of China’s tough manner of negotiating and its tenacity in promoting its national interests. The Chinese companies offer very tough conditions that Russians cannot accept Without economic collaboration, there won’t be the social foundation for robust political relations
America Will Never Be The Saudi Swing It might overtake Saudi production but that hardly leaves it much export margin . U.S. pricing ‘power’ will purely become a function of how much collateral damage it does to other producer states, not dictating how much consumers have to pay at the pumps
The Cold War disappeared 21 years ago. Yet America's military deployments have little changed. Nowhere is that more evident than on the Japanese island of Okinawa. It is time for Washington to lighten Okinawa's burden. of both U.S. ground forces in Japan and the larger mutual defense treaty between the two nations has disappeared. It's time to reconsider both Tokyo's and Washington's regional roles. both domestic pacifism and regional opposition have discouraged reconsideration of Japan's military role. Washington's willingness to continue defending an increasingly wealthy Japan made a rethink unnecessary.
the Court has never risked executive branch non-acquiescence in its enemy combatant decision making Court decision making in this area has largely tracked social and political forces. the Court has found ways to expand its authority without risking an institutionally costly backlash Supreme Court interventions in the enemy combatant disputes never pushed the limits of what was acceptable to the political branches The Court maximized its authority by moving incrementally and expanding judicial power in ways acceptable to the political branches there is no reason to think that the Court will depart from past practices during the Obama administration. the Court's 2009 decision to back away from a case involving Bush administration efforts to detain a legal resident without charges. After agreeing to hear a challenge the Court sided with Obama and removed the case from its docket there was simply no reason for the Justices to force Obama to formally disavow or embrace Bush administration legal arguments an administration decision supporting Bush administration arguments would set the stage for a costly battle between the Court and the new administration A decision on the merits would have opened the Court up to charges of judicial over-reaching Kiyemba displays the Court's sensitivity to its status vis-a-vis the other branches and to the risks of unnecessarily interjecting itself in national security policy. Throughout the course of its decision making, the Court has moved incrementally In so doing, the Court has expanded its authority vis-a-vis the President. Obama administration efforts to moot al-Marri speak to the administration's desire to avoid Supreme Court rulings that might limit the scope of presidential power What is striking is that the Court never took more than it could get - it carved out space for itself without risking or political backlash Its decision to steer clear of Obama-era disputes avoids the risks of a costly backlash while creating incentives for  Obama to take judicial authority into account (by settling these cases outside of court) the Court was able to flex its muscles without meaningfully undermining the policy preferences of and Congress there is good reason to think that the Court will follow the path it has laid down taking social and political forces into account so as to protect its turf without risking national security or elected government backlash
wind also may bolster national security, since it's a distributed energy source. "It's not like a nuclear or coal power plant where you can target a single location," "Turbines are distributed. You'd essentially have to destroy individual turbines separately."
NOAA made several attempts a decade ago to promote a national aquatic farming initiative that would cut through the red tape and set up a one-stop-shop for deep-water fish farming permits. Bills were introduced in Congress twice but were shot down due to opposition from entrenched fishing interests. While this sort of short-term protectionism is always politically popular, the reality is that domestic fisheries continue to shrink due to catch limitations.
Lacan proposes that his enquiry into ethics must be one to go “more deeply into the notion of the real previous notions of ‘nature’ have been too far ‘different’––from being far too Platonic––than his own; and because it’s the very exclusions in these previous notions which upon return, as return of excess, are yielding our most tragic problems when faced with problems of the magnitude of global warming we often think the answer is to be more moral, more good, and we are thankful when exponents of the Good in some way bring attention to the problem the idea of the Good continue to predicate themselves on a radically false picture of the human-condition: which only then lines itself up aside of an age- old repression, a repression of das Ding, that Freudian Thing in our inner real which, when it returns after being disavowed and denied in the name of the Good too long, is even more devastating. Presently we are accelerating along the path of what Lacan discloses as our civilisation’s “race towards destruction”, a “massive destruction”, “a resurgence of savagery”, snaking the paths traced out before us by the centuries long dominion of Western morality not because we aren’t in accordance enough with a moral ideal of the Sovereign good, but rather, it’s because we aren’t in accordance enough with a proper understanding of the real. we still at some level think that being more moral, in accordance with the Good’s inherited repressive structures towards our drives, desire, and truthfulness about the real, is actually the answer to––rather than the source of––our most tragic problems. The goal here is why we must desist from deluding ourselves under the tightening grip of a Sovereign Good, for this is precisely the move which cuts the Thing loose after pressing down for far too long, a slippery hand’s palming on the coils of a spring, forever readying the subsequent explosion. real tends to end up only in our gun-sights as an imaginary overlaying of an external other, when the signifier ‘enmity’ appears life itself becomes enemy too, for as being made up of the earthly and organic, life could never be free of what it is in essence. And what is the death-drive Lacan salvages from the Monstre de Sade, which wills to go beyond the destruction of mere beings, by destroying too the principle from which fresh sets could emerge negative devaluations of our earthly, organic life though are really of our own construction: is only the mirror which shows expressed what Platonic- neurotics are but hide inside loathing contempt for life, built up from the unconscious and disowned, distorted and damned up, built up, instinctual-ideational elements of their own subjective psyches, phobically ferocious of that Thingly real lying not so dormant, and readying within Nietzsche teaches to say ‘Yes’ to the real of nature   with psychoanalysis truths are out. nihilism and the annihilation of the species is bad art and the ‘knowledge’ claims it trumpets on should only make us flare. we can only consider such cultural-civil regressions as we saw on display with that whole propaganda comedy that surrounded the war for more oil in Iraq as infantile; the hapless results of sibling rivalries gone too far astray it is possible within the perspectives opened up by Lacan to view a social-historical or individual neurosis of any kind: including the expressed acted-out, perverse-sadistic form that escapes when the Good is temporarily loosed of its repressive grip––and say No, not that, that’s not a cure, that’s a mirage; that’s sheer fantasy, resentment, spite; that’s not a cure it will only make things worse; worse in a different way, but worse nonetheless! The Ethics of Psychoanalysis has us find now in our inner natures: we can eventually again say ‘Yes’-to-life in such the way that it overcomes the nihilism of not caring too much whether we as individuals or species live or die, whether we as culture or civilisation advance or decline We must continue instead to train ourselves to stare the real directly in the face For unless we can continue to utilise, sublimate, enjoy and get a positive, well-guided jouissance out of all aspects of life then the chances are we’re going to be at least in part, happy enough in no longer living it: offering not even a puff of genuine political praxis! We either face up to the death-drive or let the disowned, un-understood drive resurge of its own volition until it accidentally finishes us
What the Senate Democratic leader didn't mention was how hard it's been to persuade Congress Few, if any, lawmakers oppose the credits. What's frustrating supporters is the battle over how to pay for them
Fidel Castro’s efforts to wall off the island from the north have failed miserably fanatics would help him wall off Cuba, restrict the access its citizens have to American culture and generally thwart a hoped-for transition from dictatorship to democracy. Bizarrely, those accomplices consider themselves Castro’s biggest enemies. They have dedicated themselves to his demise. It’s the anti-Castro faction who should be embarrassed. The Cuban embargo is one of the most antiquated and least sensible federal laws remaining on the books. the most promising avenue for changing Cuba lies in courting it, not cutting it off For decades, our government has believed the best way to change China is through engagement the sensible policy would be to end the embargo
The bwa's goals were three-fold. First, the bwa aimed to dispel the myth of the Black matriarchy. Their second goal was to reevaluate the oppression of Black women in slavery. Countering "the widespread concept that by some miracle, the oppression of slavery for the black woman was not as degrading, not as horrifying, not as barbaric as it had been for the black man," the bwa argued that, in a society where Black men were oppressed because of their race, Black women were "further enslaved by our sex." The bwa's third goal, to redefine the role of Black woman in revolutionary struggle, responded to the sexism of Black Nationalist rhetoric, That is, black men began defining the role of black women in the movement. They stated that our role was a supportive one, others stated that we must become breeders and provide an army The bwa recognized the contradictions in redefining Blackness based on sexist ideas about family and sex roles including following the white patriarchal nuclear family. It called, instead, for "a true revolutionary movement [that] must enhance the status of women."
Acid rain has been a fully realized ecological problem acid rain is becoming a significant problem Scientists fear the negative effects will continue to worsen unless governments and industries work together. Acid rain can affect bodies of water by increasing the acidity until fish and marine vegetation can no longer survive forms of aquatic life struggle to survive plankton, the base of the aquatic system, lack its food source, negatively affecting all marine life toxic metals such as aluminum and mercury can be released and seep into the groundwater. At pH levels of 4.5 and below, nearly all aquatic life will die Acid rain also greatly affects forests and soil by washing away vital nutrients and replacing them with harmful toxins. Some of the great forests in Germany and western Europe are dying from acid deposition essential nutrients for plant life are washed away by acid rain, which can also affect crop yields toxic metals are transferred from the atmosphere to forests. These retard growth of local plant life

Putin forgot EU gas import dependency is matched by Russian export dependency. , the company would clearly be hit very hard by any interruption to its European exports. : Russia depends on oil and gas revenue to fund its imperial ambitions and maintain stability at home Russia could actually stop selling gas to Europe and no one would be any the wiser, or colder, until next winter. Russia would immediately notice the difference in the bank, which is why they don't want to interrupt supply.

Trump is the champion of outsourcing to nemesis countries particularly Mexico. Trump has a blind eye to people brought here to work with work visas infuriating many of his core supporters his company hired thousands of imported immigrant laborers and above the congressionally-mandated annual cap it is issuing 15,000 more for immediate use this has infuriated Trump’s most outspoken anti-immigrant supporters has unleashed the wrath of a cluster of organizations

Perhaps one of the most alarming measures that the TPP will implement will be the further destruction of the U.S. manufacturing sector as the TPP will send even more manufacturing jobs overseas. very little is known about the agreement Like other trade agreements before it, such as NAFTA and the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement he TPP is being advertised to the U.S. as a means to improve our economy and increase exports disastrous effects of NAFTA are any indication, TPP will only serve to further cripple our industrial base. America has already experienced the destruction of our manufacturing capabilities with NAFTA a “free trade” agreement that saw much of our manufacturing industry outsourced to foreign nations continues to ram the TPP into law, then surely the United States will fall victim to even more economic destruction The U.S. public knows how damaging “free trade” agreements are, but those taking part in the TPP negotiations don’t care. They’re too busy working to appease corrupt corporations and other 1%-ers who stand to benefit financially from the TPP.

Climate change killed the dinosaurs Maybe someday it will be our fossils that another race will dig up in the future no less than extinction is faced by the human race unless we are able to address global warming the human race still has an opportunity to save itself the world must be involved in adaptation. "Prevention" is no longer possible since climate change is already happening. the increasing number and intensity of devastating typhoons evidence that the world's climatic and weather conditions are turning deadly because of climate change. this generation the last chance for the human race" to do something and ensure that humanity stays alive in this planet. A few nations and communities have already begun adapting their lifestyles to cope with the effects of climate change. In Bangladesh, farmers have switched to raising ducks In Norway, houses with elevated foundations have been constructed , bringing information to crafting an action plan for adaptation remains a challenge.
the Constitution acknowledged that state governments might violate constitutionally guaranteed rights the judicial branch of federal government were empowered to remedy those violations. the U.S. Supreme Court was justified . Rather, it is judicial responsibility, allegiance to the law and to the Constitution, rooted securely in a theory of rights as propounded by our framers.
the end of the Cold War has seen a strengthening of international and regional mechanisms of dispute resolution and conflict containment UN peacekeeping has grown in missions in sub-Saharan Africa and sophistication African regional mechanisms are stronger. The African Union and regional organizations have taken a greater interest in the prevention of armed conflict African luminaries serve as ad hoc ambassadors of peace. In Kenya's 2007–8 crisis, for example, Kofi Annan was a key player; South Africa plays an increasingly active role in settling African wars international criminal justice mechanisms are stronger than ever before these mechanisms correspond with a decline of warfare these mechanisms point to a stronger and strengthening international conflict reduction regime
Litter is found in coastal areas and oceans across the world Litter damages ecosystems and wildlife and adversely affects economic activities Marine litter consists mainly of slowly degradable or non-degradable substances, which inevitably accumulate in the environment Land-based sources of litter include:¶ municipal wastes medical waste various types of wastes from industrial installations and military activities;¶ wastes from tourism and leisure activities
The U S exercises effective hegemony over the world economic and political system China may occasionally resent that reality, but the benefits of participating outweigh the drawbacks The agenda-setting power of the U.S. is visible in Chinese economic reform its consideration of TPP), and its request to re-open negotiations on the BIT) Chinese leaders know they must lower trade and investment barriers, and secure better access for Chinese firms to investment deals
All members of the Tohono O’odham tribe, whether U.S. or Mexican citizens, are entitled to access the reservation clinic overseen by the U.S. government. In practice, border policies prevent this enforcement of U.S. immigration laws has made it extremely difficult for all Tohono O’odham to continue their sovereign right to pass and re-pass the United States-Mexico border as done for centuries as our members are routinely stopped by the U.S. Border Patrol, while others have been actually ‘returned’ to Mexico even though enrolled.” Many O’odham in Mexico do not have proper documentation required to cross legally, whether birth certificates (lacking due to home births) or tribal IDs (because they lack paperwork or witnesses required for enrollment).
If a future Republican president has the opportunity to replace Justice Ginsburg the results could be no less consequential No More Marriage Equality: the decision striking down the unconstitutional Defense of Marriage Act — was a 5–4 decision with Ginsburg in the majority. At the very least, the nation’s drive towards nationwide marriage equality could come to a screeching halt. Criminalizing Sex: Thus, if Lawrence falls, the government could find its way into every American’s bedroom. The End of Abortion Rights: Roe v. Wade is already on life support . Nevertheless, Kennedy provided the key fifth vote to retain “the essential holding of Roe v. Wade” in a case called Planned Parenthood v. Casey. If Ginsburg is replaced by a conservative, there will likely be only four votes willing to retain that holding. Watering Down Minority Votes: Five justices voted in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry to strike part of a Texas redistricting map because it tried to protect an incumbent Republican congressman by reducing the impact of Latino voters If Ginsburg is replaced by a conservative, these kinds of tactics could become common. Executing Children & The Intellectually Disabled: There are almost certainly four votes on the Supreme Court to permit executions of children and the intellectually disabled. Ginsburg’s replacement could be the fifth. Millions Without Health Care: the decision that largely preserved the Affordable Care Act was a 5–4 decision, with four justices voting to repeal Obamacare in its entirety. If those four justices gain a fifth vote, it could not only strip millions of Americans of the health insurance that they will soon gain under this law, but it could toss the entire American health care system into chaos
The scary part according to the piece: “Because China believes it is much weaker than the United States, they are more likely to launch a massive preemptive strike in a crisis.” Yikes that “For at least the next decade, while China remains relatively weak compared to the United States, there is a real danger that Beijing and Washington will find themselves in a crisis that could quickly escalate to military conflict.” Indeed, the idea of escalation and preemptive strikes by China has been discussed in various circles for several years now. For numerous reasons that scholars consider, such as history, the current nature of military technology or the various arguments made by Chinese academics advocating such a military posture, many feel that it would be very much in Beijing's interests to strike hard and decisively
Al-Qa`ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is one of the few beneficiaries of Yemen’s collapse into civil war. It now has expanded its operations in Yemen, benefiting from a larger recruiting pool AQAP’s enlarged safe haven supports its efforts locally, but also serves as a sanctuary for the external operations cell that previously has threatened the United States several times. The affiliate remains al-Qa`ida’s greatest direct threat to the United States and it is growing stronger The Yemeni military and security forces, what is left of them, are no longer fighting AQAP. Those elements that remain are divided and degraded, operating without a central command, and have no incentive to enter into another fight. Finally, there is an active insurgency in Yemen rooted in Sunni communities that provides an opportunity for AQAP to further establish itself. The conditions are ripe for success, and AQAP is an adaptive organization. AQAP’s gains in Yemen could have disastrous consequences. AQAP was behind at least four major attempted attacks on U.S. interests outside of Yemen, and all of those occurred when the group was weaker than it is today. AQAP is also still a key asset for the global al-Qa`ida network, providing overall leadership guidance, sharing expertise, and coordinating transnational attacks. AQAP’s growing strength in Yemen could reverberate throughout the al-Qa`ida network, raising the stakes in the competition between al-Qa`ida and the Islamic State to lead the global jihadist movement.3 AQAP had already declared the Huthis as an enemy, describing them as heretics taking orders from Iran, who must be stopped AQAP conducted mass-casualty attacks against the Huthis, such as a December 18 twin suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (SVBIED) strike in the Red Sea port city of al-Hudaydah.4 AQAP was able to sustain the same level of activity against the Yemeni military even as it increasingly targeted Huthis. This shows that AQAP had maintained some sort of reserve capability, and also that it was probably able to add strength over time. The alignment of AQAP’s objectives with those of the popular resistance militias created an alliance where it might not otherwise have existed, especially since AQAP’s ideology is foreign to most Yemenis. It is within this space that AQAP seems to have been able to expand its base within the insurgency. The Saudi-led military intervention is also creating opportunities for AQAP. al-Qa`ida is likely under pressure to conduct a spectacular attack against the West in order to demonstrate its continued relevance AQAP’s well-developed capabilities, which have been enhanced by its expanded safe haven in Yemen. The persistence of AQAP’s bomb-making capabilities and its expertise in transnational attacks underpins the enduring threat from that group. A July 30 statement attributed to al-Asiri noted that AQAP has “chosen war against America” and that “America is first The leaders of both al-Qa`ida and AQAP have again begun pushing for smaller-scale lone-wolf attacks in the West.n AQAP first began calling for such attacks, which it calls lone jihad, in July 2010, with the release of its English-language magazine Inspire and regular statements from the late radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.
Trump executive orders clear the way to drastically reduce the U S role in the U N and other international organizations, as well as begin a process to review and potentially abrogate certain forms of multilateral treaties The order also calls for terminating funding for any organization that “is influenced by any state that sponsors terrorism” or is blamed for the persecution of marginalized groups or any other systematic violation of human rights The order calls for then enacting “at least a 40 percent overall decrease” in remaining U S funding toward international organizations The order establishes a committee to recommend where those funding cuts should be made. It asks the committee to look specifically at U S funding for peacekeeping operations; the International Criminal Court and the United Nations Population Fund, which oversees maternal and reproductive health programs the cuts could severely curtail the work of U N agencies, which rely on billions of dollars in annual U S contributions for missions The second executive order, “Moratorium on New Multilateral Treaties,” calls for a review of all current and pending treaties An explanatory statement that accompanies the draft order mentions two U N treaties for review: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child Taken together, the orders suggest that Mr. Trump intends to pursue his campaign promises of withdrawing the U S from international organizations. He has expressed heavy skepticism of the U N

Society and its institutions are analogical to Derrida’s notion of community. His primary concern for the word relates to its connotations of fusion and identification (Weber, 1995). Caputo (1997) elucidates these meanings with reference to Derrida’s etymological examination of community Communio is a word for military formation and a kissing cousin of the word “munitions”: to have a communio is to be fortified on all sides, to build a “common” (com) “defense” (munis), as when a wall is put up around the city to keep the stranger or the foreigner out. The self-protective closure of “community,” then, would be just about the opposite of . . . preparation for the incoming of the other, “open” and “porous” to the other. . . . A “universal community” excluding no one is a contradiction in terms; communities always have an inside and an outside. (p. 108) Thus, the word community has negative connotations suggesting injustice, inequality, and an “us” versus “them” orientation. Community, as a thing, would constitute a binary opposition with the aforementioned concept of democratic society. Although the connotations may be latent and unconscious, any reference to a community or a derivative there of connotes the exclusion of some other. A demo- cratic society, then, must reject the analogical conceptions of community and present itself as a receptacle for receiving difference, that is, the demos (the people) representing a democratic society.
there is one major existential threat It is the threat of global warming to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. Scientists worldwide have been observing the gathering of this threat for three decades now, and what was once a mere possibility has passed through probability to near certainty. Indeed not one of more than 900 articles on climate change published in refereed scientific journals from 1993 to 2003 doubted that anthropogenic warming is occurring it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fundamentals of global warming.” Evidence from a vast international scientific monitoring effort accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: an international panel predicts “brutal droughts, floods and violent storms across the planet over warming climate is estimated to contribute to disease spreads we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how serous the effects will be  and animals, species extinction, and threatened inundation of low-lying ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. we’re just going to burn everything up   everything will collapse Global warming is the post-Cold War era’s equivalent of nuclear winter at least as serious and considerably better supported scientifically long run it puts dangers form terrorism and traditional military challenges to shame. It is a threat not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet.
Feminist analyses of human trafficking have eschewed a traditional security framework, considering instead the security of trafficked persons, recognizing the manner in which both traffickers and the state itself pose security threats Feminists argue that Focusing on trafficking as a security threat to the state neglects the voices of trafficked persons, whose human rights the state is legally obligated to protect scholars of trafficking need to shift their focus from state security to the security of people traditional security approaches compound rather than solve the problem of trafficking repressive border control policies make migration more difficult and dangerous and increase migrants’ vulnerability to traffickers trafficked persons who are deported are themselves prone to re-trafficking traditional security approaches are both morally and practically deficient to simply expand the referent of security is insufficient: care must be taken in regard to how actors are constructed as threatened prevalent constructions of human trafficking rely upon and reproduce gender and racial stereotypes that discount women’s agency establish a standard for victimization that most trafficked persons cannot meet and unjustly prioritize the sexual traffic of white women over the traffic of women and men of all races who are trafficked human security is characterized by a shift in focus from security of the state to the security of people feminists not only establish women as a referent of security and focus on gender-related human rights abuses but also study the manner in which gender stereotypes are used to establish and reproduce categories of practices, perpetrators, and victims
Maduro is not continuing the fight with the speed that we need Maduro is feeling pressure from the chavistas also an opposition party that refuses to accept his victory decisions are being made by the shadowy "political-military command while the politicians bicker, Venezuela is suffering Maduro looks like someone who just barely scraped a win after Chavez it's going to make Maduro go down in history as the man who couldn't keep up Chavez's legacy Maduro lacks the built-up goodwill that Chavez enjoyed he's be one hundred percent accountable for the failings under Chavez Maduro must now win the country's confidence if he is to lead his nation forward
President Mike Pence? The question is way ahead of where we are   Pence would be an improvement on grounds of simple competence He would make the country safer Americans would have less cause to fear that a blundering president might lead us into war with North Korea or Iran. Despite all that, he has read the Constitution and understands its meaning. He would be less likely than Trump to try to pressure the FBI to drop an investigation, to take one example. He has even defended freedom of the press He’s very serious about public policy, and willing to work with Democrats where there’s common purpose.” It’s tempting to say: Let Republicans continue to struggle in the mess Trump makes Why give them a chance to right their ship? The worse the better But that ignores the risks that would come from allowing Trump to continue exercising the powers of the presidency in both law enforcement and foreign policy. For the next three years, given the limited alternatives, I’d opt for President Pence — the sooner the better.
International agreements to promote cooperation in scientific research and development can be bilateral or multilateral, government-wide or at the level of individual technical agencies Scientific cooperation between the United States and other countries is undertaken using a variety of arrangements, from informal scientist-to-scientist collaborations to cooperation between research institutions to formal agreements between technical agencies. While S&T agreements are not necessary for these types of interactions, other nations often seek S&T agreements with the United States because they carry the weight of being legally binding and having been negotiated on behalf of the U.S. government. These agreements endeavor to establish a framework to foster international science collaboration while protecting intellectual property, establishing benefit sharing, and preventing taxation of research equipment There are three areas where the agreement text often varies: the intellectual property rights annex, which delineates how the parties share and exploit intellectual property generated
Emergency preparedness requires substantive and procedural coordination to harmonize initiatives at various levels of governance. Dynamic federalism can occur in a manner that allows federalist systems to address climate change Nascent disaster planning has begun to harmonize the roles of the public sector’s various layers adaptation measures need to integrate policies to protect food security and such infrastructure as transportation systems and power stations in the face of fires, floods, and other potential disasters
Onshore state and local economies benefit from the development of OCS resources by providing goods and services to offshore oil and gas extraction sites A variety of industries are involved in this effort: shipbuilders provide exploration vessels, permanent and movable platforms, and resupply vessels; steelworkers fashion the drilling machinery and specialized pipes required for offshore resource extraction; accountants and bankers provide financial services; and other onshore employees provide groceries, transportation, refining, and other duties. These onshore jobs, in turn, support other jobs and other industries (such as retail and hospitality establishments
The profound injustices that inhere in climate change’s disproportionate effects are obvious the unequal burden falls on those who have not been primarily responsible for climate change African Americans are “less responsible for climate change than other Americans African Americans emit 20 percent less greenhouse gases per household the less wealthy half of America, regardless of race, is far less responsible for carbon dioxide emissions as well The injustice is the compounding effect of the environmental risk on the underlying societal inequities the legacy of slavery, segregation, the placement of reservations for indigenous populations, and the more elusive systemic discrimination that has followed is now locking in differentiated experiences of a warming planet The distribution of climate change impacts is likely to be increasingly unjust
Business actors on both sides will be reluctant to enter into comprehensive partnerships fearing that their engagement will follow the familiar unsustainable pattern of cooperation companies will be concerned about sharing technological expertise without getting significant market entry in return skepticism will result in Chinese companies being reluctant to provide entry points into the domestic market governmental actors on both sides will have to play an active role in facilitating this development by providing additional incentives and minimizing possible risks for those companies willing to take the cooperative logic to the next level The required change in the logic of international technology cooperation can only be achieved if all of these groups alter their current behavior with regards to three interlinked dimensions
A maritime stand-off between China and the Philippines developed in a reef area known as the Scaborough Shoal in April, with China denying reports it was preparing for war at the height of the tension in May.∂ Both sides accused the other Vietnam was also angered by a recent call from China for oil exploration in disputed territory.∂ China has overlapping territorial claims with several Asean members - the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei - in the resource rich area.∂ The four affected countries want action but others, like Cambodia, are recipients of Chinese aid and investment, and reluctant to rock the boat, says the BBC's Guy DeLauney.∂

Wouldn’t it be terrific if they had also been celebrating Oil Independence Day As temperatures rise across the country, so does our national anxiety over gas prices. Every summer brings the same dilemma: families agonizing over how much of their paychecks they are willing to fork over to errands and summer road trips, and politicians agonizing about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and engaging in “drill, baby, drill” politics we will never be energy independent as long as we remain joined at the hip with oil They would raise American production over the short term, but they would have little impact on the world price of oil which Americans pay even on domestic oil and would leave America fully exposed to future oil price shocks We can chart a course toward lasting energy independence by making modest investments in electric vehicle infrastructure now This infrastructure is a beginning, but much more needs to be done. With a sustained focus on vehicle incentives, charging infrastructure and a little bit of research and development, we could greatly accelerate the adoption of oil-free car travel it’s time for us to finally declare our independence from overseas oil and rising gas prices. We have the technology and the know-how to make electric vehicles a true choice for millions of families over the next decade, providing freedom from oil and oil prices. Now we just need the political will to move forward
there are threats. Because of its conventional military weakness compared to the US (and Israel), Iran has preferred to employ terrorism and cyber attacks – more often directed at American allies to create problems for Washington We’ve already seen mysterious attacks on Saudi oil tankers and drone strikes by Iran’s Houthi allies on Saudi pipelines These attacks have the twin benefits for Iran of hurting a key American ally while jacking up the price of oil the Iranians have mounted cyber-attacks on the computer network of Saudi Aramco, If Iran continues this pattern of activity, the US and its allies will look for ways to deter and defeat the Iranian attacks the US might decide to respond with a military strike. Iranians might feel compelled to respond in kind it’s not impossible it might be the start of something bigger reckless Iranian moves at times of great tension that could easily have triggered a US military response.
Bioprospecting has the added potential to cause negative impacts on delicate ecosystems of the deep seabed and Antarctica experiments in and around the Deep Seabed can introduce light and noise or change water temperature, which, in-turn, can affect pro-creation and the survival of organisms in these areas. Bioprospecting activities can also produce pollution in the form of debris or discharge from vessels and equipment. Additionally, inadvertent movement of organisms through disrupting currents or discarding of scientific samples can lead to biological contamination. Finally, there is the usual possibility of over-exploitation in harvesting organisms in these regions and the flow on environmental impacts. However, it warns that great uncertainty remains about the potential impact of bioprospecting activities Additionally, there are no clear guidelines on the environmental standards bioprospecting expeditions must meet.
There are millions of stowaways headed for the Arctic. Sea-dwelling organisms that could wreak havoc on Arctic ecosystems are using shipping routes in the North. Melting sea ice has opened routes in the Arctic making a quicker path from one side of the world to the other. If unchecked, these activities will vastly alter the exchange of invasive species, especially across the Arctic, north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans." Organisms from ports can cling to the undersides of a ship's hull or hunker down in the large tanks of seawater inside a ship. "Ships are moving over the Arctic and can carry a tremendous number of species in their ballast water The danger lies in the likelihood of these critters taking over their new environment and killing off native species. The potential biological cocktail that you can concoct is pretty staggering When a species arrives in a new environment, they have no established predators They have a tendency to prey on the native species, eat the food of the native species, and take over habitat of the native species," he said. "And in most cases, they're a little more resilient because if they're able to establish in an unfamiliar habitat, they're pretty flexible critters. If left unchecked, invasive species spread rapidly with little course of action because they can be difficult to detect until the damage is done.
Xi’s innovation is not his charisma per se Xi’s projection of himself as a    leader could set him apart Crafting an empathetic public image can enhance leadership This is true  particularly for non-democratic societies where leaders lack the legitimacy-conferring authority of popular election China’s challenges are severe, and frustrated citizens will need to know they have an empathetic leader But if trust in top leadership is eroded, and Xi is perceived to have lost his 'mandate' – a loss of faith in existing arrangements can contribute to serious social instability
The peace talks, proposals and other noticeable steps taken in order to increase the harmony between the two nations allow us to believe that an Indo-Pak war is highly unlikely
The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change as climate can be an important determinant for future price trends as well as the short-term variability of prices. , the world food equation has been at a precariously low level even small shocks on the supply or demand side of the equation will have large impacts on prices Food security of the poor is strongly affected by staple food prices, as a large part of an impoverished family’s income has to be spent on staple foods. Climate change is likely to increase food market volatility for both production and supply ]. Food system stability can also be endangered by demand shocks, when aggressive bioenergy subsidies and quota policies were applied by the political economy These sorts of policy shifts, have been motivated by energy security concerns and partly by climate mitigation objectives The resulting destabilization of food markets, was therefore partly related to climate change The 2008 food crisis stemmed from a combination of a general reduction of agricultural productivity and acute policy failures exacerbated by export restrictions applied by many countries, a lack of transparency in markets, and poor regulation of financial engagement in food commodity markets A broad set of risks needs to be considered climate change is an increasingly important one, that can ripple out to destabilize food systems, resulting in high and volatile food prices that temporarily limit poor people’s food consumption ), financial and economic shocks that lead to job loss and credit constraints ), and risks that political disruptions and failed political systems cause food insecurity This complex system of risks can assume a variety of patterns that could potentially collide in catastrophic combinations
As with ethnic and racial profiling in general, the likelihood that a particular politically profiled individual or group is connected with terrorism is minuscule. Actual terrorists can easily conceal their political and religious views, as the September 11 hijackers did.
Edelman's critique considers the topic of race that is central to the actual editorial. Edelman's critique of the editorial, with which for the most part I am deeply sympathetic, is flawed insofar as it decontextualizes West's work from the topic that has been so central to his critical interventions: black- ness. In there is for me a lot to like in this critique of antireproductive futurism but in Edelman's theory it is enacted by the active disavowal of a crisis in afrofuturism Theories Of queer temporality that fail to factor in the rela- tional relevance of race or class reproduce a crypto-universal white gay subject that is weirdly atemporal which is to say a subject whose time is a restricted and restricting hollowed-out present free of the need for the challenge Of imagining a futurity that exists beyond the self or the here and now The violent fate of their child has alerted them to the systemic violence that faces queer people In the world of The Toilet there are no hate crimes, no lexicon that identifies homophobia per se but there is the fact of an aggression constantly on the verge of brutal actualization The mimetic violence resonates across time and to the scene of the loss that the author will endure decades later The future is only the stuff of some kids Racialized kids, queer kids, are not the sovereign princes of futurity. Although Edelman does indicate that the future of the child as futurity is different from the future of actual children, his fram- ing nonetheless accepts and reproduces this monolithic figure of the child that is indeed always already white. He all but ignores the point that Other modes of particularity within the social are constitutive of subjecthood beyond the kind Of jouissance that refuses both narratological meaning and what he understands as the fantasy Of futurit It is important not to hand over futurity to normative white reproductive futurity That dominant mode of futurity is indeed "winning," but that is all the more reason to call on a utopian po- litical imagination that will enable us to glimpse another time and place a "not-yet" where queer youths of color actually get to grow up Utopian and willfully idealistic practices of thought are in order if we are to resist the perils of heteronormative pragmatism and Anglo-normative pessimism Such an escape via singularity is a ticket whose price most cannot afford. The way to deal with the asymmetries and violent frenzies that mark the present is not to forget the future The here and now is simply not enough. Queerness should and could be about a desire for another way of being in both the world and time, a desire that resists mandates to accept that which is not enough.
Pronouncements of American decline miss the real transformation under way today. What is occurring is not American decline but a dynamic process in which other states are catching up and growing more connected. In an open and rule-based international order, this is what happens. If the architects of the postwar liberal order were alive they would think that their vision had succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Markets and democracy have spread. Societies outside the West are trading and growing. The U S has more alliance partners Rival hegemonic states with revisionist and illiberal agendas have been pushed off the global stage the solutions to problems -- integrating rising powers and tackling problems cooperatively -- will lead the order's old guardians and new stakeholders to an agenda of renewal. The coming divide in world politics will not be between the United States and the rising states. Rather, the struggle will be between those who want to renew and expand today's system of multilateral governance arrangements and those who want to move to a less cooperative order The liberal international order has succeeded over the decades because its rules and institutions provide tools for governments to manage economic and security interdependence. The agenda for the renewal should be driven by this same imperative: As the hegemonic organization of the liberal international order slowly gives way, more states will have authority and status. this will still be a world that the United States wants to inhabit. A wider array of states will share the burdens of global economic and political governance, the United States will remain at the center of the global system. the U S will not be able to rule. But it can still lead.
Most of the area’s federal drug cases rest, in part, on the accounts of confidential informants who help law enforcement in return for leniency or money, or occasionally out of altruism. Many probes start with an informant and then proceed to surveillance, wiretaps and searches. Sometimes informants’ backgrounds, credibility and connections don’t fit comfortably within guidelines set in Washington. The Post-Gazette has uncovered instances in which informants used to build federal cases were convicted murderers, liars or double agents working with both law enforcement and the targets. One informant with a violent past, used in a DEA case that ended in acquittal, wasn’t put through the federal review process. informants, “are essential to obtaining convictions in nearly all significant cases.” “the naked information supplied by a cooperator forms only a part of the evidence which we obtained through many means, through hundreds or sometimes thousands of hours of very hard investigative work.” The Post-Gazette identified 384 cases, many with multiple defendants, that stemmed from the affidavits. Of those cases, 148 were built in part on the work of confidential informants. Nearly two-thirds of the cases investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration involved informants. The informant’s debt to his drug source creates an opportunity to start a case The 2001 guidelines tell agents to review a prospective informant’s criminal history and substance abuse, and whether the person is “reasonably believed to pose a danger to the public.” The FBI’s guidelines also call for a review of criminal history. Nothing in that history, though, bars the person from becoming a registered informant. To build a case against 14 people accused of selling heroin and methamphetamine the FBI used informants with backgrounds including violence and dishonesty. One of the three informants “has prior felony convictions for drug crimes, criminal homicide, retail theft, and false reports to law enforcement, among other crimes,” according to an FBI agent’s affidavit Another had prior theft, drug and resisting arrest convictions, was charged but not convicted of forgery theft by deception and false identification to law enforcement, and was cooperating for “judicial consideration” on new theft, marijuana and gun charges. Though federal prosecutors said it’s rare to use someone with a homicide conviction as an informant, they argued against a blanket ban.
offshore drilling bans in Atlantic and Pacific coastal waters absolutely critical for the health of the oceans Oil spills still occur offshore drilling is "flirting with disaster" because of potential oil spills not only at drilling rigs, but in transporting the oil produced. Tourism and fishing industry spokesmen are worried offshore drilling would impact billions of dollars a year fishing and tourism industries We cannot afford any kind of spill. ... We can't take the risk exploratory seismic activities and drilling rigs would "kill fish... scare fish and make it impossible for fishing operations to be held energy experts acknowledge that offshore development would do little to spur short-term job creation and that it would take years for new leases to be issued and another 5 to 7 years before oil would begin to flow from any new discoveries.

COLONIALISM IS NOT SETTLER COLONIALISM Colonisers and settler colonisers want essentially different things colonisers demanding different things of the colonised of what may constitute ‘labour’ settler colonisers may disagree on what indigenous people ‘going away’ In the end, what is being said in the context of a sometime contradictory cacophony is: ‘you, work for me while we wait for you to disappear’, and ‘you, move on so that you can work for me’.
America’s critical infrastructure—the utilities, refineries, military defense systems, water treatment plants and other facilities on which we depend every day—has become its soft underbelly, the place where we are now most vulnerable to attack. hundreds of thousands of analog controls in these facilities have been replaced with digital systems. Digital controls provide facility operators and managers with remote visibility and control over every aspect of their operations, including the flows and pressures in refineries, the generation and transmission of power in the electrical grid, and the temperatures in nuclear cooling towers. In doing so, they have made industrial facilities more efficient and more productive. But the same connectivity that managers use to collect data and control devices allows cyber attackers to get into control system networks to steal sensitive information, disrupt processes, and cause damage to equipment. . While early control system breaches were random, accidental infections, industrial control systems today have become the object of targeted attacks by skilled and persistent adversaries. Industrial control systems are being targeted The recently discovered Industrial Control System modules of the HAVEX trojan are one example. The malware infiltrated an indeterminate number of critical facilities by attaching itself to software updates distributed by control system manufacturers. When facilities downloaded the updates to their network, HAVEX used open communication standards to collect information from control devices and send that information to the attackers for analysis. ther hacks represent a direct threat to the safety of U.S. citizens. Earlier this year, the FBI released information on Ugly Gorilla, a Chinese attacker who invaded the control systems of utilities in the United States. While the FBI suspects this was a scouting mission, Ugly Gorilla gained the cyber keys necessary for access to systems that regulate the flow of natural gas. Considering that cyber attackers are numerous and persistent—for every one you see there are a hundred you don’t—those developments should sound alarms among executives at companies using industrial controls and with the people responsible for protecting American citizens from attacks. Hackers will always find a way to beat technology-based solutions. . Lack in security professionals who understand both digital security and control system technology Legislation (HR 3696) has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that would increase the sharing of information related to control system breaches to better arm security professionals to prevent future breaches. That is a worthwhile goal; unfortunately, there is a dire lack of security professionals with an understanding of both digital security and control system technology to benefit from this information sharing.
The U.S. biopharmaceutical industry is not only a world leader in the development of new medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics and one of our nation’s top performing industry innovation drivers, but is also a highly valuable industry in terms of its economic contributions and impacts. The economic impacts industry are typically measured by using the well-established regional economic analysis technique of input/ output (I/O) analysis Economic impacts consist of three types: direct effects ), indirect effects and induced effects Taken together, these three impact effects combine to form the total impacts. In other words, the I/O analysis models the “ripple effect” that originates from direct biopharmaceutical industry expenditures in the economy, flows through industry suppliers as they buy additional inputs, and through workers who spend their wages. The overall output impact, typically referred to as the “total economic impact” of the biopharmaceutical industry on the U.S. economy, totalled more than $1.2 trillion in 2014. $558 billion in direct effects of biopharmaceutical businesses sales and $659 billion in indirect and induced effects—meaning that every $1.00 in output generated by the biopharmaceutical industry generated an additional $1.18 in output in other sectors of the economy The revenues of the biopharmaceutical industry are responsible for supporting more than 4.4 million jobs throughout the U.S. economy. the nearly 854,000 jobs directly in the industry and an additional 3.6 million indirect and induced jobs in 2014. For every one biopharmaceutical industry job, the industry supports an additional 4.21 jobs, for a total employment multiplier of 5.21. , the biopharmaceutical industry and the workforce of its suppliers and other impacted segments of the economy received $311 billion in wages and benefits in 2014. The biopharmaceutical industry also is an important generator of federal, state, and local government revenues through the wages and benefits provided to its employees the incomes of biopharmaceutical industry workers, directly and through the multiplier effect, generated $67 billion in personal tax revenues—nearly $9 billion in state and local personal tax revenue and more than $58 billion in federal personal tax revenues in 2014.
Discrimination and Gender Stereotypes Undermine Latinas’ Educational Opportunities. A. Latinas face cultural stereotypes and a lack of role models in their daily lives. All girls, including Latinas, receive subtle and not-so-subtle messages about women’s roles in society. But gender and ethnic stereotypes can negatively affect Latinas’ educational performance in particular More egalitarian views about gender roles, on the other hand, have been found to contribute positively to Latinas’ selfimage and self-esteem and also to predict higher academic achievement and grades. In too many instances, however, Latina girls internalize these gender stereotypes. A staff member at an after-school program for Latinas in middle school noted that the prevalence of gender stereotypes in the Latino community can cause some Latinas to “get the message that their job is to be pretty and have babies.” In addition, an after-school program coordinator observed that she hears about Latina girls “getting into violent relationships and being abused by the boyfriend in high school, verbally and physically.” In fact, in a 2003 survey by the CDC, 9.2% of Latina high school students reported that they had been victims of physical dating violence. One of the things I see all the time [is] a lack of pride, even [in] the concept of Latina. In some communities where they have been migrant workers and they play a certain role in that community, and they never [have] seen themselves as the professional or the doctor in that community. That really plays down on them and they don’t see themselves doing that. Programming and Latina empowerment and education really teaches them that and changes that. Someone in front of them who looks like them and came from where they came from, that makes it a lot more real. A staff member from an after-school program, who previously taught at a middle school, also commented on the importance of role models: I was working with eighth graders in particular and their families. A lot of them don’t believe that they can make it More than half of our survey respondents reported that they had friends who had dropped out. For those trying to stay in school and succeed, the loss of part of a peer network can be discouraging and make it even harder to achieve academic goals. Aside from the motivational benefits, there also is a strong practical need for educational and career role models. Many students we interviewed lacked any understanding of their options for post-secondary education or the prerequisites to attain it, much less first-hand knowledge of the many benefits of attending college. Latinas face the intersection of ethnicity and sex discrimination—and related barriers—at school. Despite the prohibitions of federal law,68 Latinas also face gender and ethnicity discrimination—and sometimes the intersection of those two types of discrimination—by teachers, school staff, and their peers. When teachers and others in school demonstrate a lack of cultural sensitivity or rely on ethnic, racial, or gender stereotypes, student engagement and learning is hindered, increasing the risk that the students subject to discrimination will do poorly, fall behind, and drop out.69 1. Latinas face explicit discrimination based on their ethnicity. The school and program staff we interviewed cited incidents of discrimination as barriers to Latinas’ success. A school employee assigned to work with at-risk students said that discrimination is “a challenge for the girls, they don’t feel as comfortable in the classroom setting maybe. Latinas face unwelcoming school environments. Beyond explicitly discriminatory treatment, Latinas often face policies that create an unwelcoming atmosphere at school. Because feelings of alienation and marginalization have been linked to dropout,70 enabling students to embrace their ethnic identity in a welcoming, multicultural school environment may be integral to Latinas’ academic achievement. A number of students we interviewed reported not feeling comfortable speaking Spanish with friends at school, and some felt unable to embrace their own identities as Latinas with pride, particularly when the school they attended was predominantly White or African-American. For Latinas, gender stereotypes exacerbate discrimination based on ethnicity. Latinas report that they often find that they are subject to stereotypes and expectations at school that relate to their status as women in a traditionally patriarchal society. Gender stereotypes limit the range of “possible selves” that girls can envision becoming because they may internalize the images or expectations that they see around them.71 As researchers have noted, for example: “Pregnancy, housework, and stereotypes of ‘women’s work’ and career options have an impact on girls’ possible selves in ways that differ from boys’ possible selves.”72 Our respondents told us stories that illustrated how the intersection of ethnicity and gender create enhanced barriers for them. Girls in one of our focus groups, for example, reported that a non-Latino teacher in the school asked a ninth grade Latina student sitting with her friends in the cafeteria: “Why aren’t you pregnant yet? college student who responded to our survey wrote that she felt she was treated differently as a Latina when she was in high school: Generally, academic expectations are lower. You are supposed to get married and have kids and not set high academic goals for yourself. ). I was the “token” Latina achiever and thereby treated more like my White peers. Other students reported that they were treated differently by their peers, particularly where they were one of only a few Latinas in an environment dominated by White or African-American students. This peer discrimination, too, can turn students off to school. As one student who attended a mostlyWhite school explained: Being Latina, I felt so out of place in middle school . . . . And I never liked talking about my family, my background . . . . I just didn’t really want to be at school. 4. Some Latinas face sexual harassment at school. Research has shown that girls are more likely than boys to feel sexually harassed at school, and girls are more likely to be impacted negatively by the harassment. Despite the fact that the vast majority of girls responding to our survey said they had never been sexually harassed at school, 20 girls reported having been touched offensively or harassed verbally while at school. Any instances of sexual harassment must be taken seriously by schools.76 Considering that incidents of sexual harassment often go unreported, more research may be appropriate to evaluate the true extent of sexual harassment of Latinas in school.
any state contemplating a clandestine programme or nuclear tests must make certain calculations about its ability to conceal evidence all of the time from a watchful international community Balancing risks military and strategic gains against the political and economic costs is not easy. A violator has to be sure that his preparations to test can be concealed from the international community indefinitely. Tripping over just one can compromise plans and negate conceivable military advantage that he might have been hoping to derive from a clandestine test, Any state contemplating a clandestine test it must find the right geological conditions on its territory in a reasonably remote area This is where we first begin to see that the more effective the verification system and the greater the integration of the elements that combine to make it up, the greater the level of deterrence of non-compliance is. A regime can demonstrate a very high level of technical reliability coverage and sensitivity presents a formidable obstacle to anyone who wants to cheat. the Provisional Technical Secretariat (PTS) Executive Secretary—has pointed out, the very nature of the Treaty’s verification regime will be democratic in that the information behind an inspection request is derived from an independent system whose results are open to all states parties. There may, therefore, be very strong pressures to respond to a well-substantiated compliance concern, which it would be politically much more difficult to ignore or dismiss. detecting non-complianc cannot be concealed, finding sustainable and convincing technical explanations that will persuade inspectors but the Executive Council in Vienna The Council will review the final inspection report and determine whether any non-compliance has occurred. Knowing that the treaty’s OSI capability is effective and would stand a very good chance of uncovering facts strongly suggestive of non-compliance, a cheating state will have to obstruct the inspectors in the field Ther e is no known remote method of determining unambiguously whether an underground event was man-made in origin and, if so, was due to a nuclear explosion Provision for OSI would help deter clandestine testing by posing a threat that it would be identified as such; OSI would also enhance the confidence of all parties to the treaty that its provisions were being observed The CTBT verification regime presents a formidable set of obstacles for a would-be violator to surmount We might still not know exactly what deters deterrence in the context of preventing non-compliance but in the context of the CTBT the negotiators designed an integrated system that will complicate the plans of any state thinking it could evade that system successfully and derive a meaningful political advantage from doing so. The regime must inevitably impact calculations of a wouldbe evader, and higher the assurance of detection the more uncertain he can get away with cheating Deterrence of non-compliance is therefore strengthened.

, they see growing disillusionment among its electorates, austerity and rising inequality The West's uncertainty about its own future serves to magnify, even glorify, the Chinese success story for developing economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America The West has been painfully slow to react. leading Western economies continue to promote neo-liberalism as the only way forward. The consequence of inaction threatens the future of democracy The West is losing the argument, while the China model disregard for the democratic process, is gaining credibility The developing world sees that a Chinese leadership, unbothered by the inconvenience of elections and true public accountability, can create a long-term economic plan and follow it through uninterrupted. The developing world sees the fundamental advantage of this type of government intervention: business and trade can be used to bolster the regime and strengthen China's position in the international community. a widening gap between the rich and poor is causing many to doubt the validity of the Western model Many Westerners are insecure about their own values and the health and sustainability of their societies many Western governments are unwilling to accept that present levels of inequality harm, rather than promote, innovation and entrepreneurship. Neo-liberalism is that the West came to dominate the world because it embraced small government and privatisation They argue that wealthier countries started preaching to poorer countries about the need for free trade - that is, to reduce tariffs designed to protect nascent industries - and the need to reduce government size - that is, allow foreigners to buy up vital sectors of the economy back of very protectionist measures. China has succeeded, thus far, because it reformed on its own terms, picking and choosing elements of development models around East Asia - those of Japan, Singapore and Taiwan - and adapting them to its own context. The Chinese model is, in fact, intended as an antidote to Western neo-liberalism. : "Democracy existed for about 200 years in the ancient world and has existed for about 200 years in the modern world, and other than that there has been no democracy in the whole of human history.

The election of Donald Trump has economic forecasters thinking hard about upside risk.
difficult not to hear uncanny echoes of an age-old rhetoric of modernity, liberty, and liberation in government declarations difficult not to see that that rhetoric would be supplemented by policies in plain disregard of the enlightened principles the discussion of Western historiographic discourses and their shortcomings seemed ultimately inadequate.
This pressure is coming as White House officials have tried to distance themselves from the policy. Trump blames Democrats falsely for the situation Trump's former chief strategist said Republicans would face steep consequences for pushing compromise that effort risked alienating Trump's political base and contributing to election losses in November, when Republicans hope to preserve their congressional majorities
President Obama supports the immigration reform bill in the Senate Behind the scenes, however, he's been working to influence the process, The article cites a senior Obama administration official: "No decisions are being made without talking to us about it," the official said. "This does not fly if we're not O.K. with it." That Obama wants to guide the bill isn't shocking. the administration is now advertising its involvement in the dealmaking. It leaves the impression that the president wants credit for this bill when it's signed into law.
Is Donald Trump looking for an option to go to war against North Korea? That’s the unsettling conclusion from a report in The New York Times – that even Trump’s own generals and national security advisers, who are not exactly doves themselves, are afraid of giving the president any ideas. The Pentagon, “worried that the White House is moving too hastily toward military action on the Korean peninsula,” is resisting demands from Trump to explain how he might do precisely that, and so U.S. officials have consequently circumscribed how much they’re willing to tell the president. Giving the president too many options,” the officials said, “could increase the odds that he will act,” For months, White House officials, including Gen. H.R. McMaster, who heads Trump’s National Security Council, have been making worrisome threats about taking out North Korea’s arsenal. McMaster said that the likelihood of war with North Korea is “increasing every day.” There are widespread reports now that people within the Trump administration are considering giving North Korea a “bloody nose,” using a limited lightning strike hawks such as Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham declared that chances are at least 70 percent that the United States will launch all-out war with North Korea if there’s one more nuclear test. “If you ever use the military option, it’s not to just neutralize their nuclear facilities – you gotta be willing to take the regime completely down,” adding that the idea “comes up all the time” when he plays golf with Trump The Pentagon, and most professional military men, don’t support the idea of a surgical strike against North Korea, and opposition to the idea from Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is particularly strong, says Daniel Sneider, a veteran Asia analyst and a visiting scholar at the Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University. “McMaster doesn’t really know much about this part of the world, and he’s trapped within the framework of the White House, taking Trump’s wandering thoughts and trying to put them in some sort of policy framework last week when Victor Cha, an Asia strategist and professor at Georgetown University, suddenly found that his appointment to serve as U.S. ambassador to South Korea was withdrawn. The withdrawal – weeks after he’d been vetted and after he’d been approved by the South Korean government – came after Cha told the White House and the NSC that he thought the idea of a bloody-nose, limited strike on Pyongyang was a terrible idea. Following the cancellation of his appointment, in a courageous op-ed in the Washington Post, Cha outlined his belief that even a modest attack would “escalat[e] into a war that would likely kill tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Americans.” Yet, said Cha, that’s exactly what’s being considered by Trump administration officials. Donald Trump’s current thinking on North Korea goes something like this: Because the North Korean leader, Kim Jung-un, is irrational, the traditional policy of nuclear deterrence – modeled on the Cold War standoff with the Soviet Union – won’t work with him. Kim, the White House argues, is so unreliable that he’s likely to lash out, possibly striking the United States or American targets, if and when his fast-developing nuclear arsenal is ready, even if such an attack would be suicidal. Therefore, some inside the Trump administration (and, it appears, the president himself) believe that a preemptive military strike aimed at hitting North Korea’s nuclear installations is a viable, even unavoidable, action. Doing so, goes the argument, will neutralize Kim’s nuclear arms, teach him a lesson and force him to come meekly to the bargaining table. But here’s the problem. If, as they believe, Kim is aggressive-minded and irrational, then who’s to say he won’t respond to even a limited attack by the United States with all-out war, striking military targets and South Korean civilian population centers, U.S. facilities and bases, and Japanese cities? Cha himself highlighted exactly this paradox in his op-ed. “If we believe that Kim is undeterrable without such a strike, how can we also believe that a strike will deter him from responding in kind?” “Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.” By referring to “the mistakes of past administrations,” Trump means the record of diplomatic engagements with North Korea since the 1990s. None of that diplomacy ultimately dissuaded North Korea from expanding its nuclear-weapons program and its ballistic-missile development. Yet, a war on the Korean Peninsula would end up being so catastrophic – with as many as 300,000 killed even without the use of nuclear weapons by either side – that the vast majority of experts familiar with Korea believe that diplomacy is the only plausible option “They think that the only way forward is an agreement between North Korea and South Korea, and they believe that it’s failed so far because of hardline policies from the United States.” By carefully balancing his ties to the United States with his policy of seeking talks with North Korea, Moon has managed a breakthrough of sorts. Following Kim’s New Year speech, in which he suggested his country’s participation in the Winter Olympics, Moon responded positively. Further down the road – though it might take many years – could be an accord that would have all sides agree to denuclearize the entire Korean Peninsula. For now, however – at least as far as the White House is concerned – it’s war, not peace, that seem to be on the horizon.
In analyzing the problems of the securitization of cyberspace, the concept of threat inflation, the shift towards censorship and surveillance, the militarization of cyberspace, and the problem with military industrial complexes will be evaluated Threat inflation is a concept in political science whereby elites will create concern for a threat which goes way beyond what is required, Cyber-war has been used to describe many different actions The shift towards securitization of cyberspace is very well connected, Securitization of cyberspace is a threat to the modern liberal democracy Due to the sophistication and highly reported cases of cyber-attack it is increasingly a strategic-military concern danger of focusing on the strategic-military aspect of cyber-attacks is subjecting it to zero-sum rules, whereby one state’s gain is another state’s loss concentrating on the danger of cyber-attacks is unnecessary and creates insecurity in the international system This invokes enemy images even though there is no identifiable enemy, centers too strongly on national security measures instead of economic and business solutions, and wrong suggests that states can establish control over cyberspace there are major misperceptions about cyber-attack over representing the threat will cause unnecessary costs an arms race in cyberspace creates an environment in which crime, espionage, malware, denial of service, filtering, and surveillance prosper and thriv The militarization has caused a conflict within cyberspace, The final major problem with the securitization of cyberspace is the build-up of the military industrial complex Since WWII, there has been a military-industrial complex that encourages extravagant defense spending placing industry before the public securitization of cyberspace may be encouraging the creation of a cyber-industrial complex
the course of Sino-US relations during the early 1950s, and the response by the United States to a new and seemingly imminent China ‘threat’, is once more unexplainable without attention to the centrality of American identity. China became a ‘threat’ for reasons other than its physical and behavioural attributes. They relied upon processes of interpretation and representation and were again central to prescribing the limits of political potentiality in Washington. The US intervention in defence of Taiwan in June 1950 has been predominantly analysed in terms of military and strategic considerations. The question which remains is how the defence of Taiwan was actually made possible. societal representations gave China’s (and the United States’) material forces meaning and expose how US policies of the time could be enacted towards a socially constructed rather than self evident China threat. When Truman announced his intention to protect Taiwan he argued that Communist forces now represented a direct threat to American security. American support for Taiwan not only required an appreciation of the strategic realities of the Cold War, but the understanding that it represented a noncommunist member of the imagined Free World and an extension of the values of American identity. Taiwan, like China, existed for American imaginations. the material forces which ‘threatened’ the United States were not the external objects of circulating discourses about them. China’s capacity to become a threat had not increased since so recently being dismissed, but power/knowledge now made China threatening to American security. Labelling communist dangers ‘outside pressures’ it was an act of foreign policy designed to protect American identity. American representations of an imagined China threat adjusted the boundaries of possibility beyond intervention in the Taiwan Strait. Washington’s policy reaffirmed China’s (communist) foreignness from the (democratic-capitalist) United States Discourses of ideology had largely replaced those of race in the protection of what it was but the US was still imagined as a ‘fully made’ society vulnerable to ‘civilisational decomposition’. acts of US policy themselves were designed to prevent the erosion of American identity representations of China were explicitly advanced as propaganda. They were functional, with a clear purpose to demonise the PRC and present as unequivocal the dangers it was understood to pose. Exaggerated claims of a China threat were again responsible as the existing order was considered increasingly endangered. This developing crisis once more worked in tandem with the discourses which distanced China from the United States, reinforcing the construction of the threat as rhetoric intensified over how to restore order. the purpose of this latest crisis was to facilitate particular avenues of US policy. Only this way can it be revealed how the United States could legitimately defend a regime on Taiwan dismissed as unfit to govern, while containing and marginalising a land and people so recently declared unthreatening. powerful discourses had been advanced to enable particular policies towards a constructed China threat. The Truman Doctrine in particular confirmed understandings of American identity and made it unthinkable that communism could succeed where capitalism and democracy might fail. those discourses continued to frame the boundaries of Washington’s approach towards a China ‘threat’ which existed primarily within and for American imaginations.
the biopolitics of debilitation is an analytic that allows us to see the assemblage relations of disability, debility, and capacity, noting that Euro-American rights frames, often centralizing individuals extracted from populations, operates through forms of capacitation in relation to that which it must sublimate: the material conditions of deliberate population debilitation. This assemblage thus not only deindividualizes disability, a move that many disability scholars have pushed for. It also shifts from positing disability as a collective experience to nuancing that observation through attention to populations and their differential and uneven precarity. Rethinking disability through the precarity of populations not only acknowledges that there is more disability within disenfranchised and precarious populations, but also insists that debilitation is a tactical practice deployed in order to create and precaritize populations and maintain them as such. The biopolitics of debilitation thus situates disability within formulations of risk, whereby disability is understood not as phenomenological essence but as risk coding, as an embedded aspect of biopolitical population management. Addressed immediately is the social justice question of what is access to health? What does it mean to have access to health, or to access health, and to access health care? This formulation centralizes the connections between poverty, debt, and disability. The concept of “crippling debt,” for example, reveals the ways in which fiscal “health” is a form of capacitation or capacity. Theorizing debt as bodily vulnerability recognizes the historical and structural relationships between poverty and disability—engendered by colonization and labor exploitation. It also highlights that disability can be negotiated through access to medical care only for the very few. If one is against the neoliberal normativizing and micromanaging of health how are populations who have little access to health situated in this formulation? Warfare, exploitative laboring conditions, occupations, incarceration count as a large component of these structures, part of an inaccessible ableist social, as much as buildings, curbs, ramps, elevators, service animals When one asks, “Is it accessible?” the social model asks, “Accessible to what? What does an accessible health care infrastructure look like, and for whom?” Is a young black man without a diagnosed disability living in the United States who is statistically much more likely than most to be imprisoned, shot at by police, or killed by the time of adulthood actually a referent for what it means to be able-bodied? What I am arguing would not diminish the specificity of disabled embodiment, nor necessarily expand what the term “disability” encompasses. Rather, this approach connects disability to those who are debilitated, to those whose bodily experiences challenge who is seen as able-bodied
The US government agencies running the "war on terror" have become increasingly reliant on an extralegal practice known as "extraordinary rendition"--a euphemism for a policy of seizing suspicious individuals at home or abroad without even the semblance of due process and sending them off to be interrogated by allied regimes known to practice torture The war on terror is dirty, the realists begin by admitting now stuck supporting a paradoxical and hypocritical policy of publicly condemning torture while privately practicing it Only by rejecting in principle the notion that torture is permissible even in dire circumstances ) can we retain the requisite sense of guilt and awareness of the inadmissibility
Reducing distrust Both sides want to work toward a peaceful resolution of existing differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan are viewed in Beijing  as confirming American arrogance and determination to interfere in China’s domestic affairs and to prevent peaceful unification from occurring, thereby harming a clearly-articulated Chinese core interest Washington and Beijing should engage in serious discussion Lack of such discussion has contributed to having each side make worst case assumptions in their acquisition and deployment of military resources, enhancing mutual distrust and potentially reducing the chances of maintaining the peace in the Taiwan Strait that both sides desire
There is a real—but largely concealed—war which is taking place throughout the African continent the current US military expansion in Africa is just another step in the wrong direction In 2007, under the pretext of the ‘war on terror’, the US consolidated its various military operations in Africa to establish the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM over the course of the last 10 years, AFRICOM has been transformed into a central command for military incursions and interventions. However, that violent role has rapidly worsened during the first year of Trump’s term in office. US troops are now conducting 3,500 exercises and military engagements throughout Africa per year, an average of 10 per day. US mainstream media rarely discusses this ongoing war, thus giving the military ample space to destabilize any of the continent’s 54 countries as it pleases Mattis, like other defense officials in the previous two administrations, justifies the US military transgressions as part of ongoing ‘counter-terrorism’ efforts. But such coded reference has served as a pretense for the US to intervene in, and exploit, a massive region with a great economic potential. The old colonial ‘Scramble for Africa’ is being reinvented by global powers that fully fathom the extent of the untapped economic largesse of the continent the US is invested mostly in the military option, which promises to inflict untold harm and destabilize many nations. The 2012 coup in Mali, carried out by a US-trained army captain is only one example
The United States still needs friends in the world - now more than ever the most important but least appreciated successes of American foreign policy has been the reservoir of goodwill toward our country that we have created by educating successive generations of world leaders. our country gains much from being their destination of choice. It also remains true that 99.99 percent of the foreign students enrolled in our institutions wish us no ill, It is very much worth preserving the freedom of foreign scholars to participate in scientific exchanges at U.S. universities and research institutes. America's world leadership is being tested as rarely before Foreign scholars who help us understand the world from whence they come do not threaten our national security; they enhance it , t might be necessary to forego the benefits that they bring. But that's not the case. Foreign students and scholars constitute a tiny proportion of the 30 million foreign visitors who enter the United States annually with visas, and a minuscule proportion of the hundreds of millions who cross our borders legally each year Monitoring systems will never reveal people's intentions There is no substitute for the intelligence community being able to identify dangerous people before they get here Given that foreign students are already among the most closely monitored of all nonimmigrant visitors, it is difficult not to see increased monitoring as a diversion from the task at hand.
Students shy away from STEM for many reasons One is a lack of math proficiency Only 46 percent of students who take the ACT achieve the Readiness Benchmark in math. Higher education spends at least $2 billion per year to compensate for weaknesses in students’ secondary education. one reason for high diversion out of STEM majors was that students did not succeed as expected and then switched to a major for which they felt better equipped the percentage of freshmen intending to study computer science dropped to 1.5 percent in 2010 from 5.2 percent in 2000 Only five percent of those who start in a non-STEM major graduate with a STEM degree. It is hard for those who graduate with a non STEM degree to obtain the credentials necessary to work in a STEM field Only six percent of those who work in a STEM career did not graduate with a STEM major.2
Cassandra's curse, however, was not that she was wrong, but that no one believed her. I don't know a single nuclear expert who thinks that the threat of nuclear terrorism is shrinking. I don't know a single one who thinks that the actions taken by world leaders at this week's Nuclear Security Summit are enough. news that the ISIS terrorists who blew up the airport and attacked the metro, were secretly videotaping a Belgian nuclear official. What are the risks? First, that terrorists could steal a complete nuclear weapon This is not impossible. The key risk is that the outside terrorists get insider help For example, a radical jihadist working at a Pakistan weapon storage site. Or the Belgian base just outside Brussels where we still stash a half-dozen nuclear weapons left over from Cold War deployments Or air base in Turkey where we keep an estimated 50 weapons just 200 miles from the Syrian border. Second, terrorists could steal the "stuff" of a bomb, highly enriched uranium or plutonium. if they could get 50 or 100 pounds of uranium -- about the size of a bag of sugar -- they could construct a Hiroshima-style bomb. ISIS, with its money, territory and global networks, poses the greatest threat to do this that we have ever seen. Third terrorists could just attack a nuclear power reactor, fuel storage or other site to trigger a massive radioactive release that could contaminate hundreds or thousands of square miles, like Fukushima. larger planes could destroy them. Or a series of suicide truck bombers. it might not even take a physical explosion. The capabilities of some terrorist groups, particularly the Islamic State, have grown dramatically, says Harvard scholar William Tobey In a net calculation, the risk of nuclear terrorism is higher than it was two years ago. U S spends about $35 billion on nuclear weapons every year. This year, we will spend $1.8 billion on all our efforts to stop the spread these weapons You don't have to be a nuclear expert to know something is out of whack here.
What we need are hardnosed proposals for pragmatically improving our institutions. The idea of Real Utopias embraces this tension between dreams and practice. It is grounded in the belief that what is pragmatically possible is not fixed independently of our imaginations, but is itself shaped by our visions. Self-fulfilling prophecies are powerful forces it is certainly true that without “will” many “ways” become impossible. A vital belief in a utopian ideal may be necessary to motivate people to leave on the journey from the status quo in the first place, even though the likely actual destination may fall short of the utopian ideal. Social institutions can be designed in ways that eliminate forms of oppression that thwart human aspirations for fulfilling and meaningful lives. The central task of emancipatory politics is to create such institutions. conservatives have argued that grand designs for social reconstruction are nearly always disasters. While contemporary social institutions may be far from perfect, they are serviceable. At least they provide the minimal conditions for social order and stable interactions. These institutions have evolved through a process of incremental modification as people adapt social rules and practices to changing circumstances. This does not preclude institutional change, even deliberate institutional change, but it means that such change should be very cautious and incremental and should not envision wholesale transformations of existing arrangements. The conservative critique of radical projects is that the uncontrollable, and usually negative, unintended consequences of these efforts at massive social change inevitably swamp the intended consequences. Of course, one can point out that many reforms favored by conservatives also have massive, destructive unintended consequences. Particularly in Marxist tradition radical intellectuals have insisted that wholesale redesign of social institutions is within the grasp of human beings. This does not mean that detailed institutional “blueprints” can be devised in advance of the opportunity to create an alternative. What can be worked out are the core organizing principles of alternatives to existing institutions, the principles that would guide the pragmatic trial-and-error task of institution-building. unintended consequences can be dealt with as they arrive “after the revolution.” The crucial point is that unintended consequences need not pose a fatal threat to the emancipatory projects themselves. Regardless of which seems most plausible, the belief in the possibility of radical alternatives to existing institutions has played an important role in contemporary political life. It is likely that the political space for social democratic reforms was expanded because more radical ruptures with capitalism were seen as possible and that depended on many people believing that radical ruptures were workable. The belief in the viability of revolutionary socialism enhanced the achievability of reformist social democracy as a form of class compromise. The political conditions for progressive tinkering with social arrangements may depend in significant ways on the presence of more radical visions of possible transformations. This does suggest plausible visions of radical alternatives, with firm theoretical foundations, are an important condition for emancipatory social change. We now live in a world which radical visions are mocked rather than taken seriously. This need not mean an abandonment of emancipatory values, but it does reflect a cynicism about the human capacity to realize those values on a substantial scale. This cynicism weakens progressive political forces in general.
An anti-globalization wave has been blazing across Latin America. rhetoric only became fierier after his recent re-election, hasn't missed an opportunity to highlight the alleged evils of capitalism. despite the fiery rhetoric, often used to boost popularity among the poor, the economic realities of the region indicate that trade across borders remains both desirable and necessary. It is clear that Latin American economies are intertwined with foreign markets, and particularly the U.S There is a major gap between the political rhetoric of some leaders and the world they are forced to inhabit. Latin American economies have to live in the inescapable reality of an intertwined world in which economic and commercial relations are a given. Ignoring this reality will not bring about revolutions from thin air. It will simply hurt the country's performance and ultimately diminish the conditions for growing and generating wealth. Leaders in the region will have to make choices on whether to work with the realities of globalized economies or try to turn their backs on it. it is crucial to think of long-term trade relations with the U.S—and other countries. Those who remain in the anti-globalization bloc, however, may soon see their economies plummeting even further. The real question for Latin America isn't whether trade and open markets are good or even necessary combating poverty by attacking cross-border trade and investment itself is like fighting heart disease by campaigning against exercise. The script of rabid nationalism and anti-globalization hasn't been exhausted yet. But sooner or later reality will rear its head. Those Latin American leaders who decide to ignore the inescapable dynamics of growth only do so at their own peril. And most unfortunately, at their country's as well.
Congress has the power to check the President. But if it does not use that power, the President has incentive to fill the void That does not mean that the President can do whatever he wants As true in war on terror cases, the Supreme Court can place some limits on presidential power But without a Congress willing to assert its institutional prerogatives defeats in court are not likely to stick to the President
Conservatives want the 80-year-old centrist to step down and give President Donald Trump a chance to reshape the court in a more conservative mold Kennedy is the most powerful jurist in the world The longer he stays on the court the greater the chance he can shape the legal doctrine for years to come. the court's actions might provide good reasons for him to stay. Take the travel ban three of his colleagues -- who wanted the entire ban to go into effect -- think that the "compromise" that Kennedy joined will cause chaos as parties in the coming days and weeks grapple with what actually constitutes a "bona fide" connection. Kennedy might see the need to help shepherd in a resolution to the complicated case concerning the role of the executive when the court hears the full case this fall. "The world -- and justice Kennedy -- likely suspect that both those challenging and defending the so-called travel ban are arguing to an audience of one
both deconstruction and AC citizenship perspectives suggest that either extreme – SSD as abstract and depersonalized technocratic information exchange and SSD as highly personalized and conviction-driven – are problematic because both perspectives of SSD assume that convictions or speech acts are stable many performance debaters contend that their convictions and the meaning of their experiences are formed and stable prior to communication. These attempts to regulate competitive debate through stable identities and beliefs are problematic supporters of fiat- based policy debate assume that convictions change and are tested through debate these proponents often assume that the meaning of a resolution is always stable and predictable across a number of contexts, which allows for an anticipated switching of sides on the resolution each debate the meaning of a text is always already shifting and unstable, as texts do not have inherent and secured meaning attempts to police and dismiss performance- style debating or regulate access to arguments based on sincerity depend on an inaccurate view of communication and the emerging political sphere we need a new definition of SSD that recognizes the value of deconstructive speech act theory for both performance- and traditional policy-styles of debate We should not define switch-side debate in reaction to fears about the conservative acting in support of communist China makes one a communist or liberal roleplaying as the state is imperialist ideological indoctrination of students and the ethics of those pedagogical choices These concerns misunderstand the inherent and ontological instability or play or polysemy contained in all communication and its effects Rather than viewing the resolution as defining and stabilizing the inherent meaning of a resolution and clearly demarcating each side of that statement, we should view the resolution as an artifact that has unstable and contestable meaning Even when exact meaning is policed through topicality, no single topicality debate ever plays out the same way, thus ensuring variation and difference through citation. ¶ SSD does not have to be at odds with performative speech acts. Instead, SSD should be defined as switching sides on an orientation or perspective towards a set of words that operate as an unfixed resolutional text These orientations would exist on a continuum with many ways to approach the resolution One of those orientations could be to read for the presence of framers’ intention located in the syntax and arrangement of the resolution’s terms as a “partial, if not, a total glimpse of the author’s intentions This perspective would likely best serve traditional federal government-centered policy debate affirmatives might approach the resolution as a debate about identities and experiences that are both included and excluded by the text These debates should not be determined on a strict ethical system defined by the authenticity or sincerity of beliefs or performances, but instead on the perlocutionary effects that the speech acts have This would best preserve a space for performance- style debate while allowing for negative arguments like counterplans and disadvantages. ¶ Maintaining that the resolution is an unstable artifact does not default us into a nihilistic situation without stable communication or debate the ontological possibility of play and instability does not mean that communication and a semi-stable resolution is impossible play always “implies a possibility and not an absolute condition of miscommunication....Différance does not mark the end of communication, rather it opens new possibilities that are latent behind the text debate can begin with grammar and other cues for intent and meaning of the resolution, but there must always be room for a critique of that reading’s exclusions and consequences This redefinition of switch- side debate allows a great deal of space for both traditional policy and conviction and performance-style debaters to operate it acknowledges the ontological instability of speech acts and their illocutionary effects, which opens up a number of possibilities for both policy and performance-styles of debate.

Under international law, there is no official definition of Indigenous, although the United Nations generally identifies Indigenous groups as autonomous and self-sustaining societies that have faced discrimination, marginalization and assimilation of their cultures and peoples due to the arrival of a larger or more dominant settler population. T Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems. The above definition distinguishes Indigenous peoples from the settlers, colonizers, or other populations who have attempted to undermine Indigenous autonomy. It was also carefully crafted to remove potentially problematic notions of race and blood quantum.
In contrast to Iran, its revolutionary and revisionist tendencies, Saudi Arabia has been a proponent of the prevailing order and status-quo balance of power in the Middle East This seems to be changing under Prince Mohammad bin Salman who continues to receive support from Donald Trump's Whether it is an attempt to revise the status quo or prevent it from being revised by others, Saudi bound to have significant regional implications. Tim Kaine revealed the Trump administration approved the transfer of nuclear know-how to Saudi Arabia seven times including after the murder of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in early October 2018 One of the transfers was 16 days after Khashoggi was brutally eliminated inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Trump is seeking to negotiate a nuclear cooperation agreement that would allow Saudi to use US technology for energy purposes, Trump's transactional and profit-centred approach to foreign policy- have raised doubts about the US resolve, or even ability, to keep possible Saudi nuclear ambitions in check.

Simultaneously Saudis are seeking to develop a ballistic missile programme of their own, with Chinese assistance.  satellite imagery taken by Planet Labs showed rocket engine tests for ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons at a military base near the town of al-Dawadmi, Saudi Arabia is gradually diversifying its alliances by fostering ties with Russia and China
US's forceful interventionist agenda coupled with the 2008 global recession has had a detrimental effect on the US economy and provided a platform for anti-American sentiment With increasing national debt and an inflexible and uncompromising Congress internal affairs have tarnished its power capabilities in both absolute and relative terms the simultaneous economic rise of developing countries India and China have threatened the composition of global politics and imposed a possible limit to US relative power 'imperial overstretch' describe the US's modern failures in foreign policy and the eventual fall of the empire' by both an empirical and observational perspective, it becomes evident to see that the gradual transition from a unilateral to multilateral world is upon us. US power decline is no longer a possibility, but an inevitability demanding general acceptance.
The total number of petitions filed for U-visas has increased significantly in recent years. that number had increased to 60,710 petitions. Although U-visas have long been controversial (particularly because of concerns that the U-visa process is susceptible to abuse), This sort of fraud, however, makes it more difficult for actual victims of crime to get the protection they need, because it draws resources away from the adjudication of genuine applications Moreover, such fraud undermines the legitimacy of the U-visa program as a whole. The bigger question, however, is how Paul was able to get away with this fraud for so long. Logically, the large number of U-visa petitions that have been filed in recent years has placed a strain on USCIS's ability to screen for fraud in the application process It will be interesting to see whether USCIS revokes any fraudulently obtained visas arising from this case.
Don’t call it the Venezuelan Missile Crisis. Russian troops in Venezuela barely rate as a crisis at all. Trump administration is up in arms over an estimated 100 Russian troops and military advisers that were airlifted into Venezuela Russia’s got to leave Venezuela,” declared Secretary of State Mike Pompeo It is understandable that Washington would be unhappy about Moscow’s support for a regime it would like to see overthrown But how big a threat to U.S. security is a handful of Russian troops permanently stationed in Venezuela? Not much. To really threaten the continental United States from Venezuela, Russia would have to be capable of projecting power 1,400 miles the distance from Caracas to Miami or at least far enough out to threaten shipping lanes or the Panama Canal. That would mean putting missiles or long-range bombers or shorter-range tactical jets deployment of that size would be noticed by U.S. intelligence. No White House administration could tolerate it, Venezuela as a permanent Russian naval base, is another possibility But again, any base that could service a large number of surface ships and nuclear submarines would be intolerable to Washington. As with Cuba or Nicaragua during the Cold War, a Russian outpost in Venezuela could function as an intelligence base in Latin America or as a staging point to foment political conflict in the region. But that’s hardly an existential threat to the United State. even then, too active a Russian presence would only energize Americans
growth is destroying the planet and dooming humanity but without ceaselessly growing production we would be even worse off Such is the lunatic suicidal logic of capitalist economics
growth always slams up against non-negotiable constraints sooner or later If a species finds that its food source has expanded, its numbers will increase to take advantage of those surplus calories—but then its food source will become depleted as more mouths consume it, and its predators will likewise become more numerous Population "blooms" are always followed by crashes and die-offs
there seemed to be several incontrovertible truths Clinton’s nomination was inevitable, and Trump stood no chance the prevailing narrative is that while there is now a chance that Trump could actually win it’s basically Clinton’s election to lose. Pundits focus on “fundamentals like Hillary’s superior fundraising, analytics, or ground game however, these haven’t proven terribly predictive this cycle by focusing on conventional elements, analysts seem to be overlooking novel dynamics which are likely more important the public’s persistent and negative perception of Clinton, the incumbency handicap, and negative intersectionality while Trump’s numbers are currently low, there is a real opportunity for him to radically change public perception for the better Manafort He’s made for this job Expect Trump’s numbers to rise. Hillary’s numbers are unlikely to follow the same trajectory people know her well, but they know her specifically as a politician Public opinion of Clinton has been on a steady decline the problem facing Hillary is that she’s not only going to be held to account for the failures and shortcomings of Obama but also of her husband’s tenure in office Americans are overwhelmingly dissatisfied with the state of affairs this hurts Hillary the incumbency handicap, which would be significant for virtually any Democrat in 2016, will be particularly pronounced against Hillary Trump’s parochialism resonates with many Americans This is true across the board: male and female, young and old, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, highly-intelligent or not, Democrat or Republican his nationalistic economic and foreign policy message resonates even more broadly contrary to prevailing narratives, the deck seems to be stacked against Clinton in 2016
China and the United States will work together to try to prevent further missile tests by North Korea Obama met Xi Jinping on a nuclear summit in Washington Xi said it was critical all parties "fully and strictly" implemented newly-agreed sanctions.

Canada‘s visa requirement decision in such detail because it is an excellent example of the essence of unilateralism in world politics when explained from the perspective of Canadian interests, the visa decision makes considerable sense. the unilateralist doesn‘t care about the interests of others – that‘s what makes it unilateralist only Canadian interests were considered Mexican interests were completely unimportant, as were all those business interests in Canada affected by the dramatic decrease in visitors from Mexico officials in Ottawa calculated correctly that Mexico was in no position to introduce a mirror visa requirement, But the visa decision is important because it demonstrates so clearly how little impact multilateralism has on Canadian policy towards Mexico thus making sense of Pastor‘s puzzle.

Today the high seas have become less important for military operations. The U.S. Navy budget illuminates this point. Amphibious Ready Groups were deployed in response to a crisis only a fraction of the time as an aircraft carrier task force.
People can expect to face more floods, droughts and violent ) Yet for the first time, the IPCC is offering a glimmer of hope. It acknowledges that some of the changes will be beneficial – including higher crop yields in places like Canada, and Central Asia – and that in others cases, people will be able to adapt to them. “The really big breakthrough in this report is the new idea of thinking about managing climate change,” said , the global ecology director at the Carnegie Institution in and a co-chairman of the report. “We have a lot of the tools for dealing effectively with it. We just need to be smart about it. “Governments, firms, and communities around the world are building experience with adaptation. Thi Adaptations could include better flood defences or building houses that can withstand tropical cyclones
increasing evidence demonstrates that the majority of immigrants who enter Canada through the Skilled Worker Program are unable to secure full-time permanent positions in their field of training Of those who are able to find employment, 60% settle in careers for which they are over qualified (Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council (TRIEC) 2003). Previous research has demonstrated the existence of three key barriers to employment for immigrants arriving under the Skilled Worker Program. These include a lack of recognition of foreign credentials, delayed assessment by provincial regulatory bodies, and a lack of Canadian employment experience (Brouwer 1999, Bauder 2003). As a result, many remain unemployed or underemployed For instance, 55% of skilled immigrants in Ontario who are able to find work within six months of landing do so outside their field of expertise (TRIEC 2003). Most of these jobs are part-time, lack the security of permanent employment, and rarely utilise the skills and education of the skilled immigrants little attention has been directed towards the health-related impacts of such employment 186 J.

This is surprising considering that the association between secure employment and positive health has been widely acknowledged
The Heritage framework proposes a radical restructuring of Indian education programs. It calls for the creation of Education Savings Accounts for students who attend Bureau of Indian Education Schools funding would equal 90 percent of the per pupil funding formula. The idea is that students could use this money at any school, including private ones. “Such an option would provide a lifeline to the 48,000 children currently trapped in BIE schools which have been deemed the ‘worst schools in America.'” The idea stems from a Heritage Issue Brief on Education by Lindsey Burke The paper says it’s appropriate for Congress to seriously consider ways to improve the education offered to Native American children living on or near reservations. Instead of continuing to funnel $830 million per year to schools that are failing to adequately serve these children, funds should be made accessible to parents via an education savings account, enabling families to choose options that work for them and that open the doors of educational opportunity.”
To illustrate the importance of federal education funding and highlight the local impact CEF hosted a panel of education practitioners with experience implementing education programs Without an increased federal investment, state and local education budgets have to make up the shortfall, which limits their ability to finance other education services. as a result of shortfall, local and state funds must cover the costs preventing expanding in other areas Students desperately need the funds provided through federal education funding. local resources are limited due to a low tax base Federal dollars help The President’s budget would impose devastating cuts to important federal financial aid programs
One might reasonably argue that the success of these piecemeal reforms would give the regime more breathing space to survive. This is a valid concern, but is analytically unsound. Although it sounds counter-intuitive, economic success will be the harbinger of structural collapse in Cuba.
The United States hosts many immigrant workers who send home money each month to help support their extended families by paying for school fees, food, housing, job training, and medicine. But these remittances are not aid, and they are certainly not an indicator of U.S. generosity or stinginess. . Some argue that remittances can still substitute for aid, but this assertion is only partially true. One difference is the regional disparities in their destinations. Remittances from the United States are heavily concentrated in Latin America and much scantier in the poorer countries of Africa and South Asia. Of the $28 billion in U.S. remittances to developing countries in 2003, the majority went to middle-income countries, and more than half went to Latin America government policy only modestly and indirectly affects remittances, so the United States cannot direct them to the neediest countries (in response to a natural disaster, for example), or use them to support U.S. foreign-policy goals. Remittances are an important complement to aid, but they are not a substitute.
Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC) decided to introduce OTEC developed by a Japanese venture, Xenesys Inc. KNPC and Xenesys will sign an official contract The world's first practical OTEC plant became feasible with the invention of a new OTEC system known as the "Uehara Cycle" developed by Saga University, Japan. Obtaining an exclusive license of the government-patented system, Xenesys developed practical technologies for OTEC power generation and water production through its joint research with Saga University. Saudi Arabia is considering the construction of this new OTC plant as well. Xenesys is also working to introduce its new technology to Thailand and other countries along the Indian Ocean.
if I tell you, for instance that I'll break your legs if you don't stay out of Malibu – I limit your options. It's not that hanging around in Malibu 8 is no longer an option for you 6 A coercive threat limits the options of its recipient in that it removes the option of both avoiding the threatened consequence and doing the thing the coercer has demanded not be done. in cases of coercion – at least wrongful coercion – it's very likely that the option removed by the threat is one that the coercee would prefer to have open to her. If this were not true, the threat would either be unnecessary or ineffective
The key point here is that such concerns are not judicially manageable; they should be left to political accountability and conscience current immigration enforcement priorities from the DACA and DAPA programs) merely focus enforcement efforts for the time being on cases the executive branch judges to be most important While some again might question whether the priorities are correct, or whether they reflect the best effort at enforcement the government could undertake, these questions are not judicially manageable by conventional criteria.
Afro-Cubans also saw their socio-economic condition worsened due to the increase of population and the introduction of cheaper labor from Haiti and Jamaica (LÃ³pez, 1986). Consequently, President JosÃ© Miguel GÃ³mez suspended constitutional guarantees in the province of Oriente and organized his aides to form volunteer civilian militias against the black movement, supplying arms and ammunition. His goal was to exterminate the black movement, and prevent military intervention by the United States . . "Government forces suspected the entire Afro-Cuban population of collaborating with the rebels. Black men and women living in towns and villages were assumed to serve as spies for the independientes." (Helg 1995, 221) They were killed and left unburied on the sides of the roads or hanging in trees as symbols of the official forces' strength to repel the rebellion.¶ But the harsh repression of the black movement did not prevent the U.S. from sending troops to Cuba The U.S. marines presence in Oriente indirectly contributed to the anti-black sentiment and violence. The 'independientes' were seen as anti-Cubans who might facilitate U.S. intervention.
It might seem alarmist to equate a civilian nuclear program with the weakening of the non-proliferation regime, the threat of a nuclear arms race, or the further deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations. history and support such a conclusion A Venezuelan nuclear program is bad for global non-proliferation efforts. The civilian program is a necessary precondition for a weapons program and makes such a program possible. Venezuela’s close ties with Syria and Iran should cause observers to doubt just how seriously it will take its non-proliferation requirements Chávez will choose to pursue nuclear weapons as a way to blunt U.S. power, shore up domestic support by rallying his people behind a nuclear crusade, or assert Venezuela’s role in the Americas. leaders rarely announce that they plan to use peaceful nuclear technology as a stepping stone to a weapons program. Given Venezuela’s rich oil, gas, and hydroelectric resources, the need for a nuclear power program seems questionable. Considering Chávez’s willingness to stand with those who snub the global non-proliferation regime and his hostility towards the United States he say one thing and do another on the nuclear issue. Even if Chávez neither has nor develops the intention to pursue nuclear weapons, he will find it increasingly attractive to evade or complicate the IAEA inspection regime for other reasons. he will exploit weaknesses in the global non-proliferation regime. Mixed signals from a nuclear Venezuela would have troubling implications for keeping Latin America free of nuclear weapons Brazil and Argentina would most likely seriously reconsider their earlier decisions to forgo nuclear weapons with ambiguous nuclear priorities a South American nuclear arms race could quite likely happen Proliferation on the continent may start in Caracas but it would  certainly spread, ending the international success story of Latin America as a nuclear-weapons free zone.
There is a great deal of evidence that robotics and artificial intelligence could displace huge swaths of the American workforce in the next couple of decades. the Trump administration, which has made job creation a central focus, doesn't seem to think it's a problem the US doesn't take steps to help workers as their jobs are scooped up by robots or AI. A 2015 McKinsey report, for instance, found that existing technology could feasibly replace 45% of work activities Trump repeatedly encouraged companies to "buy American, hire American." During his presidency, he has pledged to work with large corporations to keep jobs within US borders. But as Business Insider's Pedro da Costa has said, many of the jobs Trump wants to bring back have not been shipped overseas they've been lost to the cheap, consistent labor of robots. In many industries, such as telemarketing, customer service, and fast-food service, humans can't compete with the latest technology. "No one should be under the illusion that millions of manufacturing jobs are coming back to America," Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in the MIT Technology Review in November.
Accepting all of this, an agency does have some limited capacity to make credible commitments.42 There are no doubt a variety of in- teresting reasons for this, such as an agency’s ability to discern and rely on stable allocations of political, institutional, or economic power.43 Here this Article focuses on one formal, legal reason why agencies can commit to the stability of their policy over time. This is due to the operation of an administrative law doctrine that goes by different names but will be called here the Accardi principle. The complexities of that doctrine will be explored shortly, but consider now a simple statement of it: an agency has an obligation to follow its own rules.45 , a court can invalidate agency action that does not comply with existing rules. And all relevant parties proceed in the shadow of that possibility. Thus, if an agency chooses to embed its self-regulatory measure in a rule, it can rely on the fact that a court will require it to adhere to that rule in the future. This doctrine gives the agency some capacity to make credible commitments. , parties can rely on the fact that a court will force the agency to follow it in the future. The Accardi doctrine provides third party enforcement of a par- ticular status quo baseline that the agency must follow—namely, the existing rules that limit the agency’s discretion. It is worth noting that it would be possible for the regime to be otherwise. It could be that every time a new administration begins its tenure, the prior adminis- tration’s self-regulatory measures would not bind the new administra- tion, or at least not be judicially enforceable by the courts. The new administration would start from scratch, as it were. Such a regime would have obvious advantages in terms of electoral responsiveness, but at a cost to stability. Regardless, it is not the regime we have.
a multitude of examples demonstrate that states explicitly tradeoff K12 funding for higher education funding. South Carolina highlights such a battle.13 All that remains is to parcel the slices to the different departments and institutions. This intensifies competition because all departments assume that the total available funding is limited to the figure placed on the chalkboard. If any slice is enlarged, it means other slices must shrink Major attention is therefore paid to defending the allocations of the previous fiscal period the status quo. In this atmosphere it is very difficult to get a hearing for the funding of any entirely new needs or for expansion of any existing services.
Successful foreign policy involves encouraging other nations to behave in ways that benefit the United States the United States has often attempted to use arms sales to generate the sort of leverage or influence necessary to do this. History reveals, that the benefits of the arms for influence strategy are limited for two main reasons First, the range of cases in which arms sales can produce useful leverage is much narrower than is often imagined arms sales are unnecessary in situations where the other country already agrees or complies with the American position This category includes most U.S. allies and close partners under many circumstances the arms for influence strategy is a nonstarter when the other state will never agree to comply with American demands. there is a large group of nations with tiny defense budgets that simply don’t buy enough major conventional weaponry to provide much incentive for arms sales. The second problem with the arms for influence strategy is that international pressure in general typically has a very limited impact on state behavior Arms sales are in effect a fairly weak version of economic sanctions which research has shown have limited effects, The U.S. track record of generating influence through arms sales specifically is quite mixed Although the United States has used the promise of arms sales or the threat of denying arms successfully from time to time, the failures outnumber the victories.
Expansion Didn't Set Off the Ukrainian Crisis Russia hasn't been "encircled" by the West Putin simply wants to be able to invade his neighbors at will Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea has produced a great deal of handwringing in the West, with much of the ire directed at NATO Blaming NATO's enlargement for Russian belligerence has been a feature of European security debates and a reliable excuse for explaining away every disagreement between Moscow and the West Tempting as it may be nothing could be further from the truth It remains, the Russian regime's ideology, rhetoric, and conduct that provided the impulse for NATO expansion, not the other way around. enlargement has been one of the few unmitigated success stories of American foreign policy, as it consolidated democracy and security on a continent once scarred by total war Faulting NATO for Russia's bad behavior betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of post-Cold War European politics misrepresents the organization's role as a defensive alliance, and confuses aggressor with victim.  a little history is in order. hostile actions towards neighbors hardly ended with the collapse of Soviet communism Moscow continued to bully its former republics and satellites before the first round of NATO enlargement after Russia formally recognized the independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- Moscow cut off energy supplies to these small, reborn democracies in an attempt to pressure them into keeping Russian military forces and intelligence officers on their sovereign territory. Russia halted oil shipments to the country no less than nine times after it refused to sell refineries to a Russian state company the Russian Foreign Ministry maintains that the Baltic republics -- which Russia militarily conquered, occupied, and subjugated for nearly five decades -- "voluntarily joined the Soviet Union Balts didn't become part of NATO until 2004. Given this history, is it any wonder why these countries or any other country victimized by Soviet-imposed tyranny -- would want to join the alliance? Is it NATO's fault for saying OK? This is a myth, stemming from a selective Russian interpretation of diplomacy Russia's claim that it was deceived by the West has no basis in fact. Russia's cries of Western betrayal are really just a smokescreen NATO has repeatedly gone out of its way to be conciliatory. Not only did Western leaders repeatedly and explicitly make clear that NATO posed no threat whatsoever to Russia's security, some even suggested that Russia ultimately join the alliance With its invasion of Crimea it is Russia, and not NATO, that has returned the continent to "the wars of past Europe More significant, was what this terse exchange revealed about the debate over NATO expansion: It has never really been about the enlargement of a defensive military alliance, but rather the nature of the Russian regime itself. If Russia had ceased posing a threat to its neighbors, there would have been nothing preventing it from becoming a candidate for membership Russia's hostility stems from the root as all of its conflicts with the West: the zero-sum worldview and neo-imperialist agenda of Putin he declared the breakup of the Soviet Union to be "a major geopolitical disaster of the 20th century if there was any remaining doubt that he intends to reconstitute the empire, Putin erased it with his speech in which he essentially reserved the right to invade and annex any territory where ethnic Russians claim to feel oppressed say that NATO expansion "laid the groundwork for Putin's rise," gets the situation exactly backwards. Putin's ascent was almost entirely the product of domestic factors and the popular desire for a firm response to the insurgency in Chechnya NATO expansion barely registered on the minds of ordinary Russians. lending credence to Moscow's complaints about NATO expansion is intellectually irresponsible and geopolitically dangerous. Lavrov has demanded that Ukraine essentially dismember itself into autonomous regions and "firm guarantees Given that Russia has already invaded and annexed Ukrainian territory, and that it has shown no sign of discontinuing its aggressive behavior on the country's borders, these ultimatums constitute nothing less than a threat to use additional force if its demands are not met. according to a new poll Russian citizens there feel no pressure or threat from the new government direct refutation of Moscow's relentless propaganda to the contrary. The assertion by Russia (and its Western apologists) that NATO constitutes a threat has always been a ruse is Russia that threatens its neighbors today, not vice-versa. Russia's real reason for opposing NATO expansion, that the alliance's collective security provision would prevent Moscow from invading its neighbors, something that Russia has done twice in the last six years NATO -- and its expansion -- remains vital for European security and stability. There is only one country in Europe being encircled right now -- and it isn't Russia.
Not Quite a “Game Changer,” Actually: We Knew This Was Coming alarmism characterizes so much of the North Korea debate North Korea has been telling us for years that it wants a nuclear weapon Today’s launch worsens the situation, but not in ways we did not foresee Hence to the “game changer” and “Franken-missile” rhetoric that so often accompanies these North Korean mini-crises. North Korea almost certainly does not intend to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon. Even if we assume North Korea can strike it would be suicide to do so. there is one thing we have learned from the decades of decadence and gangsterism of North Korea’s ruling Kim family, it is that they like their luxuries. There is much debate about what precisely the Kims’ goals are but one obvious intention is to live up the good life Kims’ neronian habits are notorious—liquor, cars, women, yachts, palatial residences. These are no spartan, committed cadres living in caves according to a strict ideology, ready to die for their beliefs. So it is highly unlikely that the Kim elite would throw away their indulgences on a strike they know would bring devastating U.S. retaliation.  weapon, rather, is intended to deter U.S.-led regime-change efforts U S has flirted for decades with attacking North Korea by air, most notably in 1994 U S has also attacked many rogue states—Panama, Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya, to name just a few. It is therefore predictably rational for Pyongyang to seek the ultimate guarantee against such an attack. is not some madman’s dream to blow up the world, If the Kims wanted that, they could have started a cataclysmic war years ago. Kims also see the program as a hedge against Chinese domination is economically dependent on China, but its nuclear program and with global norms signal that it will not become Beijing’s political satellite. nuclear use is highly unlikely.
Although there is no original state of freedom to which we can return, if structures of power are defined by what escapes them, then resistance is as much a part of the collective field as the tendency for capture by techniques of domination power and resistance are two sides of the same coin. Tendencies towards free action, towards escape from crystallized power structures, are as primary as the tendency towards capture A powered structure is not all-encompassing. It rises from a field of emergence that includes it. It is plugged into a broader field of activity on which it feeds. That field is astir with tendencies pointing to the potential for different modes of structuration even if there is no unsullied state of freedom to return to, there is always a degree of freedom offering the potential for other emergences. There are always counter-tendencies that can be joined, and moved with, proposing themselves for amplification. There is always a margin of manoeuvre. What a body can do is tweak the field — improvise modulations of the field of activity in a way that takes up the offer of these different-order affective tendencies. What a body can do is trigger counter-amplifications and counter- crystallizations that defy capture by existing structures, streaming them into a continuing collective movement of escape. If the movement effects an intensification of the collective field through the mutual inclusion in it of reciprocally heightened capacities in contrastive attunement, then the degree of freedom has been increased across the board. Powers of existence have been collectively augmented. This can only occur from within, in situation, ﬂush with the event, in an immediacy of enaction Resistance cannot be communicated or inculcated. It can only be gestured. The gesture is a call to attunement. It is an invitation to mutual inclusion in a collective movement. The only power it has is exemplary. It cannot impose itself. It can only catch on. Its power is to throw out the lure of its own amplification. Its power is of contagion. The gesture of resistance is a micro-gesture of offered contagion, oriented otherwise than towards the structures into which the gestures of microfascism have the tendency to channel there is an aesthetic dimension — of allure, of style of gesture — that is not an added dimension but is absolutely integral to the very operation of resistance, one with its politicality. There is only one a priori: participation, participatory immersion in bare activity. Resistance comes of immanence. It cannot be led. If it is, it is already coagulating into an apparatus of capture poised to rise up and bear down, as if from above and outside. Resistance is immanent critique: a ‘critique’ that is one with its enaction. It occurs at the level on which bodies think more actively and feel more thinkingly, towards acting differently together. In this kind of resistance There are seeds. Seeds of free action blowing in the winds of bare activity, looking for a fertile field of attunement for their ﬂowering. The analogy is inexact. Such a field does not exist. In its role as exemplary gesture, resistance creates its own field. It gestures it into existence, by its own power of contagion. Resistance is performative of itself. It triggers its own self- organizing. Its field is always to come, ﬂush with its own self-amplifying event. Immanent critique cannot purport to apply already-established criteria of correctness or necessity to the field of collective action. It cannot operate in the imperative, based on a prior political programme or already structured set of moral precepts. It cannot justify itself by appealing to established principles. It immanently enacts its own principle, which is one with its exemplary movement. There is no ought to resistance. On what basis can we say that it is better to desire one's freedom than one's servitude? That one ‘ought’ to resist? An ‘ought’ is nothing but an already assumed servitude to a higher order of imperative. To say ‘ought’ is to enact our servitude to abstract principle, and to justify our imposing it on others, as from outside and above. It's a power move. As such, it carries seeds of domination — perhaps a new order of domination, but domination nonetheless. Freedom, like oppression, is desired, or it is nothing at all. It cannot be ‘oughted’ and imposed. It cannot be inculcated. It is desired, or it is nothing. Resistance is the counter-desire for the collective augmentation of powers of existence, in dynamic mutual inclusion in an intensive field of contrasts. There is no basis on which we can say it is ‘better’ in principle. But there are ways to perform its desirability — to make it more desired, more strongly tended towards, more amplificatory and exemplary. There are indeed techniques of resistance. They are techniques of relation aimed at immanent field- modulation. They are gestures already in relation, in participatory immersion, stirring towards self- augmenting relational movement The Occupy movement's refusal to advance a particular set of demands is a case in point. This refusal to set forth a programme was not a deficiency, it was an enablement. It was a way of saying that what was important was the gathering together of bodies and capacities in self-improvising collective movement and that democracy is that far-from-equilibrium movement — not its pre-programmed end in a prefigured stable structure. This is the ‘direct’, relational democracy of enactive resistance.
The administration erred in believing improved standing would give the U S greater policy leverage. The U S standing did rebound But this shift did not translate into an appreciable increase in U S soft power Bargaining in the G-20 and the UN Security Council did not get any easier. Soft power, it turns out cannot accomplish much China, Russia, and other aspiring great powers did not view themselves as partners of the U S Even allies saw Obama 's supposed modesty as a cover for shifting burden of providing global public goods to the rest of the world The administration's grand strategy was perceived as promoting narrow U.S. interests

Chinese President Xi Jinping announced Monday his nation would work to take on a broader role in the international war against terrorism, promising Russian President Vladimir Putin China would be at his disposal to aid in anti-terror efforts The meeting between the two heads of state occurred on Monday, as they were in attendance at the international climate change summit in Paris. Chinese state news outlet Xinhua reports that their meeting focused largely on the fight against radical Islam, particularly the Islamic State (ISIS) in the Middle East. “Xi said against the backdrop that tremendous changes have taken place in global anti-terrorism situation, China stands ready to work with the international community, including Russia, to combat terrorism and uphold the common interest of the world,” China reports The Xinhua report does not explicitly single out radical Islam, however. It notes that Putin responded to Xi’s offer of cooperation by saying “Russia would like to work with China to enhance cooperation in such areas as anti-terrorism, and adamantly promote democracy in international relations.” While the article did not mention any specific terrorist threats, both nations are facing significant recruitment of their citizens by the Islamic State, Russia in the Muslim-majority population of Chechnya and China in western Xinjiang province, home to most of the nation’s Muslim Uyghurs. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has largely stayed out of the dispute, save for issuing a statement urging Russia and Turkey to “increase communication to avoid further escalating the situation. The international community should earnestly strengthen coordination and cooperation in the fight against terrorism to avoid this kind of incident from happening again.” In a statement last week, for example, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei offered as solutions “relevant UN resolutions… carry[ing] out more cooperation in blocking cross-border flow of terrorists, cutting off the secret financing channels for terrorism, and fighting cyber terrorism. Xi’s statement alongside Putin is a sign that China may be willing to cooperate with allies like Russia on an elevated basis, though it fails to send the message that China is interested in any activities on the ground, or even diplomatic efforts between anti-ISIS nations.
if world population grows, as currently projected it is hard to imagine that we will succeed in meeting the ambitious targets that must be achieved to avoid the worst effects of climate change Many of those working overseas to alleviate poverty and hunger are similarly reticent to speak about population. The evidence, however, is clear: high fertility rates serve to perpetuate poverty, exacerbate food security and water scarcity, accelerate deforestation, and make it more difficult to improve living standards Population growth, in other words, is a challenge multiplier, and for many developing countries, the challenges are formidable
North Korea conducted a rocket launch o South Korea and the United States have already decided on one bilateral move: formally beginning talks over the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense That, in turn, has reignited hand wringing in China about the threat THAAD poses to Chinese national security.¶ Chinese Foreign Ministry on THAAD deployment were more severe than its statements responding to the North Korean launch.

the United Nations Office on and Crime . It found that trafficking is faciliated by widespread corruption at many levels of government and society, and that crimes are generally not restricted to certain countries. To better fight wildlife crime, officials urge a stepping-up of enforcement and monitoring, as well as increased transnational cooperation. Wildlife trafficking is a global problem, revealed the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in their first-ever World Wildlife Crime Report more ivory has been seized than cocaine, and that broad corruption is facilitating illegal trade in plants and animals. the report uses data provided by partner organizations under the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime like the CITES Secretariat and the World Customs Organization, and included an analysis of 164,000 wildlife crime related seizures from 120 different countries. Iconic species like tigers are now hanging on by a thread, he said, adding that populations of African elephants and rhinos, too, are under constant pressure from poaching. “But the threat of wildlife crime does not stop with these majestic animals….it also includes thousands and thousands of lesser-known animals, as well as marine and plant life, that are under serious pressure, and that cannot survive without our attention and help,” he said. 000 species were included in the World WISE database of seizures analyzed by experts All countries play a role as either source, transit or destination countries, and we share a responsibility to act how gaps in legislation, law enforcement and the criminal justice system can cause serious problems. The amount of illegal ivory seized worldwide in recent years was more than the amount of cocaine seized globally The report fortifies what conservationists have been worried about for a long time – the commodification of endangered species. Linking ivory to cocaine further signifies how vast and profitable this trade is — with one major caveat there is an absolute limit on the amount of ivory that can be produced, so there is a danger of a vicious cycle ensuing where each elephant poached increases scarcity, and thus the incentives for poaching another, another report titled Rise of Environmental Crime estimates global environmental crime to be worth as high as $258 billion –26 percent higher than previous estimations. Environmental crime encompasses illegal wildlife trade, forest crimes, exploitation of minerals environmental crime is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise following drug smuggling, counterfeiting and human trafficking, but that international agencies spent only $20 to $30 million combatting it It’s not just an environmental problem, it’s a threat to our societies,” It’s a way of undermining our economies, let alone killing vital biodiversity and pushing some species to the point of extinction. I Compounding the problem, not all illegally-obtained wildlife products (e.g., through poaching) are sold illegally when illegally traded wildlife is introduced into legal commercial channels, criminals have access to a much larger source of demand than they would have had on the black market alone says permits for around 900,000 legal shipments of protected wildlife products are issued annually traffic wildlife. Pangolins – or scaly anteaters – are considered a sought-after delicacy in China. The report found more than 100,000 illegally trafficked pangolins were seized between 2007 and 2013 Corruption is one of the major drivers of the illegal wildlife trade, the report confirms. It uses the example of live apes, saying the illegal trade of such large, valuable animals would not be possible without fraudlent paperwork from corrupt officials. The World Wildlife Crime Report shows the extensive involvement of transnational organized criminal groups in these highly destructive crimes and the pervasive impact of corruption, demonstrating that combating wildlife crime warrants even greater attention and resources at all levels,” said John Scanlon, Secretary-General of the Flora (CITES). In fact, the . Given that there may be only 3,000 tigers left in the wild, the report estimates the ecological impact of those skins is far greater than their $4 million value. most national laws do not criminalize possession of wildlife that was illegally harvested or traded from abroad. ’If it is illegal in your country, it is illegal in my country’ Illegal logging is one of the most destructive environmental crimes since it can destroy habitat along with targeted trees . He also recommends strengthening customs security at ports and national borders, as data show most trafficking interceptions occurr there, as well as increasing the use of wildlife forensic science to ensure the proper identification of species. He called on governments to use the UN Convention on Corruption and the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime to fight these crimes, and for the global demand for illegal wildlife products to be reduced All these efforts must be coordinated for optimal strategic effect and maximum impact wildlife trafficking isn’t just concerning the plants and animals themselves, but is a larger issue that stands to affect the world as a whole. Preserving wildlife is crucial for the well-being of people and planet alike
Annex VII approach would be the most effective resolution method the ICJ would legitimize China’s actions in the SCS as evidence of China’s sovereignty continued negotiations are also not a viable option The Philippines needs a judgment from a binding authority in order to strengthen the legal basis of all of the ASEAN states’ claims A holding in the Philippines’ favor would enable the ASEAN statesto present a united front to China that the only acceptable basis for maritime claims in the SCS must be under UNCLOS a decision by the tribunal establishing UNCLOS as the predominant authority governing the SCS disputes will benefit all parties by narrowing the areas in dispute and opening the door for joint development not only will arbitration lead to the most efficient and favorable outcome for the Philippines, it will also lay the groundwork for future stability among all claimant states in the SCS.
Few findings in political science have received as much attention as the "democratic peace," the discovery that democracies almost never fight other democracies the absence of military conflict among democracies is so consistent that it approaches the status of an "empirical law Some authors have attempted to explain the democratic peace by highlighting the role of public opinion democratic leaders are beholden to voters and claim that voters oppose war because of its human and financial costs. This predicts that democracies will behave peacefully in general A different possibility is that democratic publics are primarily averse to war against other democracies. If leaders are responsive to voters and voters are more reluctant to fight democracies than otherwise equivalent autocracies, then public opinion could play an important role We used experiments to shed new light on these important questions Participants in our experiments were substantially less supportive of military strikes against democracies than against otherwise identical autocracies because we randomly and independently manipulated the regime type of the adversary, the observed preference for peace with other democracies was almost certainly causal, rather than spurious. Our findings therefore provide empirical microfoundations for the hypothesis that the preferences of ordinary voters contribute to peace among democracies shared democracy reduces public enthusiasm for war. Democratic publics may feel reluctant to attack other democracies for a variety of reasons: They may view democracies as less threatening regard democracies as more formidable opponents or have moral qualms about using force to overturn policies that were freely chosen by citizens in another democracy shared democracy pacifies the public primarily by changing perceptions of threat and morality Those perceptions made citizens more peaceful toward democracies
THE CHINESE have simultaneously exhibited unmistakable signs of anti-Americanism and nationalism that make them less receptive to the virtues of democratization China has aggressively maligned Western-style democracy as chaos-inducing and unsuitable for the country's current economic conditions. they are skeptical of U.S. motives the Chinese people believe that the United States is seeking to contain China Chinese citizens believe that the United States is attempting to destroy stability in China
Each individual thing as intrinsic value and there is a continuity between human and nonhuman experience. One's attitude toward a dog, differs from that toward a plant, which is also a compound individual but has no center of enjoyment, and toward a rock, which, as a mere aggregate, has no intrinsic value. All three have instrumental value in supporting each other in the ecosystem." its proponents recognize the "interconnections among things, specifically between organisms and their total environments it implies "respect or even reverence for, and perhaps a feeling of kinship with, the other creatures." We are diminished not only by the misery of the Indian peasant but also by the slaughter of whales and porpoises, and . . . the 'harvesting' of the giant redwoods. Atoms as individual things have intrinsic value. Rocks express the energy inherent within their atoms. They too have intensity and intrinsic value, albeit less than that of living organisms. The assumption that rocks have intrinsic value does not mean that rocks and sentient beings would necessarily have equal ethical value but rather that they would all be treated with reverence drops of experience, complex, and interdependent he world is itself a process of fluent energy; actual entities are self-organizing wholes. Differences exist in the actual occasions that constitute each entity. Intrinsic value is not based on an extension of self-interest to the rest of nature, but on the significance of each occasion
The question raised from the void of blackness is not “yes” or “no” to solidarity, but instead explodes the bounds through which choices issue from question still remains because of the perpetuation of the African slave trade in the region, the anti-black solidarity between Israel and the Arab nations, the black flesh that is beaten, burned, murdered . Shout outs to different activists working on the frontlines of the Palestinian struggle that recognize the centrality and singularity of anti-blackness in this entire affair. If solidarity is important all cards must be laid on the table at all times This is not about intentions instead is a question of paradigm and what concepts center one’s analysis silence speaks louder than intentions the question of blackness can never arrive on time there has never been a black time only an anti-black world where black people exist as its absent center, always too loud, needing to be silenced, yet always remaining unthought and hyper-present The time is now for all of us to answer to the centrality and singularity of black suffering, against the academic mode of analogization The time is now to take up a new rubric for understanding anti-blackness, one that exceeds an anti-racist, marxist, feminist, or decolonial framework in order to force open a world where Black Lives can actually matter. It is the unflinching articulation of the unthought question stated loud, proud, and enraged that can obliterate the anti-black world — anti-blackness understood as something shared between reactionary and radical forces — and institute a new world, a Blackened world, a Black Era
many black people in America were migrating from the South, where they experienced harsh conditions of indentured servantry and Jim Crow legislation When they arrived and settled in the Northern cities, however, their hopes usually remained unfulfilled: expanding urban areas suffered because when black people moved in, white people moved out ; many black people could not find work; and the Ku Klax Klan was rising in popularity To cope with or adjust to unfamiliar and often dangerous urban life many black people in the North turned to newly flourishing black religious movements.3 Among them, the NOI was also a political organization, which evolved to be the most powerful Islamic organization in American history Between 1934 and 1955 the number of NOI temples increased from two to thirteen, and by 1960 to over thirty. The NOI invoked Islam as spiritual and political resistance to the racialized violence of the Western political and socioeconomic systems in which they were forcefully immersed. NOI leaders became heavily involved in the growing movement against anti-black, Jim Crow racism in America. Islam was an appealing religion for black people who felt disillusioned by the Christian church, its pro- integrationist messages, and with white Christians’ continued violence against black people and black non-violent protest “Islam was seen as ‘the Black Man’s religion,’ an alternative form of a radical black consciousness... that was internationalist in nature.”

humans have already started to alter the equilibrium, introducing themselves, adding new parts, into the system without knowing the possible consequences. the potentially “devastating” and “catastrophic” effects of industrialism for the Arctic ecosystem, be it from oil spill, industrial fishing or accelerated climate change The idea of catastrophe and uncontrollability is further reinforced by the use of notions such as “death spiral” and “Arctic meltdown” The vulnerability of the equilibrium may lead, if severely disrupted, to tipping points from where things become unknowable and uncontrollable “feedback loop” of accelerating ice melt and climate change: “These are factors humans cannot control, and if we are to solve the climate crisis, we have to do it before these feedback effects get beyond recovery”
Economic interdependence is an especially important factor in the relationship, for it appears to be the strongest among the mechanisms which are deemed to bring there is indeed a wide range of common interests between China and the US in global issues economic ties continue to deepen between China and the US
detailed, independent work on the economics of shale-gas production suggests that not only are the reserves claims overstated, but that the productivity of the wells is, too. problems begin with the historical production data, which is limited operators had significantly exaggerated their claims. Reserves appear to be overstated by more than 100 percent claimed lifetime productivity, or estimated ultimate recovery, of individual wells was also overstated operators seem to have applied their overly optimistic models of these older shale plays to newer plays, which may have radically different geological characteristics there is a high degree of uncertainty around the projection of recoverable shale gas resource The USGS reassessment had slashed the estimate for the Marcellus by 80 percent. Similar adjustments may be ahead for other shale plays
parolees, a kind of halfway status that does not offer a pathway to citizenship as refugees have, but protects them from deportation for two years. Those who have already received parole will have to reapply for parole when the two-year period is up
There is no evidence that this litigation has or will reduce the defendant companies’ bottom lines or customer base, and vague assertions that the pending litigation might result in “reputational” damage to the defendant companies is utterly belied by the facts. Despite two years of very public litigation in which AT&T has lost motions at every turn, AT&T just announced record profits for the third quarter of 2007: a 41% increase over the previous year. AT&T publicly attributed its success to signing a record number of new customers ermitting the litigation to proceed will not increase such risk as already may exist telecommunications companies’ recent hand-in-glove participation in national security surveillance has been perhaps most effectively broadcast around the globe by the Administration, including statements by the Director of National Intelligence Silencing the pending suits will not expunge admissions from the public record it strains credulity to suggest that the foreign enemies of the nation have not been aware for decades of this obviously necessary partnership
Fusion centers provide a window into dominant forms and logics of contemporary securitization. Moreover, even as highly secretive organizations, fusion centers embrace neoliberal rationalities of privatization and responsibilization Public–private partner- ships are key to fusion-center operations, as is the use of private security analysts in this case it is state and local governments that are burdened with unfunded mandates and concomitant pressures to staff fusion centers even while cutting other social services. One could proffer a generous reading of mission creep by fusion centers and say that these are laudable efforts by state agents and others to make their work relevant to the perceived needs of their communities such efforts lend themselves to the violation of civil liberties and privacy, while rendering ambiguous laws and policies governing intelligence operations
We have examined a prison of racism that confines us all-people of color and white people alike. The walls of the prison forcibly separate communities of color and white communities we are all shut off from each other. To dismantle racism is to tear down walls We are offered the vision and the possibility of freedom Brick by brick, stone by stone, the prison of individual, institutional, and cultural racism can be destroyed It is an organizing task that can be accomplished Facing up to these realities offers new possibilities, but refusing to face them threatens yet great dangers. The results of worldwide colonial conquest and racial domination may be reaching a point of no return. . A small white minority of the global population derives its power and privilege from the sufferings of the vast majority of peoples of color. For the sake of the world and ourselves, we dare not allow it to continue. Dismantling racism means building an antiracist society. Just as we must tear down wall brick by brick, so also we must build new structures of power and justice we cannot tear down the walls without building new antiracist structures of power in our institutions and communities
although circumstances evolve presidents inherit the same ones of predecessors Trump—despite his forthright approach—is as much a captive to these constraints as Bush and Obama circumstances generally limit their degrees of freedom presidents inherit domestic political, bureaucratic, and historical capabilities and constraints of the political system and national security state. Incoming presidents invariably depend on a national security structure developed over decades. It includes, below the level of political appointees, many of the same personnel and standard operating processes, budgetary claims made by powerful congressional constituencies, legal constraints, administrative traditions, and institutional cultures size and structure of the security apparatus by default reinforces propensity for continuity and can often undermine grand promises of politicians. national security professionals cannot simply be ignored; they are necessary for policy and strategy implementation. more valuable than ever in the absence of key appointees entirely consistent with scholarship on bureaucratic and organizational behavior, their familiarity with ongoing operations and standard operating procedures generally reinforces the strategic status quo rather than radical change for fear of unknown consequences of any major shift. withdrawal from Afghanistan sounds good on a bumper sticker, but giving terrorists a base suggests otherwise Trump’s leadership reinforced this incoming leaders often arrive intent on instituting dramatic strategic changes. Trump chose, to install three distinguished career military personnel there is no evidence to measure the relationship between Bolton’s fiery rhetoric and prescriptions when it comes to deployments. while sounding a cautious note available evidence generated an ironic paradox in Trump’s case. The vacuum created by his administration’s lack of senior appointments, coupled with training of many he appointed to leadership roles, collectively reinforced the natural tendency to be circumspect instigating any major operational changes.
The coming wave of disruptive innovation in the energy sector is likely to be driven by digital tools bringing together artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, supercomputing and automation less noticed in the public discussion about AI and other digital tools is how they could also transform more traditional energy sectors, such as oil and gas, upending our current understanding of how much oil and gas can be produced and at what cost. . AI will improve oil and gas production rates and lower costs. tools can now be used to troubleshoot underperforming wells, enhance reservoir modeling, carry out preventive maintenance before problems arise, optimize well design, drilling and completion, and even use machines to carry out tasks on unmanned, automated drilling platforms and well pads digital technologies could boost the volume of oil and gas that can be produced by around 5% and reduce costs by 10% to 20%. Morgan Stanley sees digital technologies delivering cost declines not seen since the industry’s Golden Decade from 1987 to 1997 Driving down costs through AI means more supply at lower prices There is nothing inherently green about digital innovation
The abundance of small arms-based initiatives and programs has not eliminated the problems caused by uncontrolled small arms proliferation and misuse. On the contrary, small arms continue to contribute to devastation around the world. Why have these initiatives failed?
The problem of compelled back doors is extremely difficult The simplest solution to this problem would be to amend the law to prohibit this coercive behavior by government agencies However given the realities of Washington DC, and the fear of being accused of being soft on terrorism or child pornography it is unlikely that Congress would agree to any form of legislative fix which took away this power.
Offshore wind power is a rapidly growing industry around the world. By incentivizing companies to develop offshore wind operations we reduce dependency on foreign oil, while creating good-paying manufacturing jobs
Arming Kiev can deter Russia from further aggression and support the ceasefire also bolster U.S. efforts to prevent nuclear prolif lethal military assistance, such as anti-armor weapons, as well as communications equipment and drones Such assistance would enhance Kiev’s ability to deter further Russian aggression, aggression that would threaten fatally, the possibility of a negotiated settlement. A better-armed Ukrainian military would give Putin pause, because it impose greater costs on the Russian army if the Russians break the ceasefire and renew fighting Some argue providing lethal military assistance would provoke Putin to escalate. But he has already escalated the situation This suggests the opposite may well prove true: Arming Ukraine will raise the costs of escalation to Russia and thus make it less likely Inaction could embolden him to escalate in Ukraine
Obama provided another archetype of the exemplary immigrant, the military service member, who provided a different model for neoliberal responsibility and self-management. Obama invoked the military service member as an example of an ideal, responsible, and desirable immigrant, stating, “I’ve got a young person who is serving in our military, protecting us and our freedom. Obama’s logic here was a welcome check to those who would argue that the rule of law trumps all other humanitarian considerations. Instead, Obama celebrated immigrants’ contributions to the nation and argued that concern for immigrants’ welfare and attention to their expression of cultural citizenship should factor into decisions about immigration enforcement. these stories, helped to establish the difference between ideal and nonideal immigrants by representing another type of responsible self-management, the highest expression of which was national service. The image of the immigrant service member functioned as “neoliberalism as exception” this was neoliberalism as exception because immigrants who embodied responsibility in a way that presented a significant social benefit to the nation were the exception to concerns about jobs, protectionism, and economic calculability. Apart from the stories referenced above, the emphasis on responsibility as a neoliberal exception can also be seen governing immigration policies such as the DREAM Act, DACA, and prosecutorial discretion. These policies rely heavily on the dichotomy between responsible/good immigrants versus irresponsible/criminal/bad immigrants, the former who are exceptions to concerns about national sovereignty and the rule of law and the latter who are excepted from promises of neoliberal mobility and individualism. Obama tied comprehensive immigration reform to neoliberal values, arguing that “we should make it easier for the best and brightest to come to start a business and develop products and create jobs” that undocumented immigrants “earn their way to citizenship” by paying taxes, learning English, and “going to the back of the line” distinctions between desirable and undesirable immigrants should not be surprising it is an inherent thread of presidential immigration discourse and policy The trope of responsibility, was indexed to neoliberal forms of whiteness Hernández’s real inclusion into the American community came through his faith and success in achieving the American Dream (as an entrepreneur and through his national service). The racialized image of the migrant farmworker performing stoop labor in the hot sun was transformed into the engineer, entrepreneur, and astronaut through embrace of the American Dream and neoliberal values of hard work, responsibility, and service embodiment of neoliberal subjectivity and a moral economy of whiteness helped to belonging more than did his actual legal status as citizen These undocumented immigrants were too entrepreneurial (or not enough), too individual (or not enough), or too monocultural. This meant they did not really believe in the nation’s precepts and/or that they threatened its sovereignty and economy, making them the target of police surveillance, prosecution, or deportation. This dichotomy between exemplary and “criminal” immigrants termed the “dilemma” of social value: the fact that the social value of one marginalized group is often constructed through the “social death” of “an/other, and that other is almost always poor, racialized, criminalized, segregated, legally vulnerable, and unprotected” ). This discourse granted social value to certain immigrants who embraced responsibility and entrepreneurialism while contributing to the social death of criminalized and racialized populations.
aim of the following paper is to turn attention of the reader to an economic sector paper only highlights the most important structures related to this context and develops some arguments for discussion
It is becoming clear that the post-9/11 surveillance apparatus may be at cross-purposes with our high-tech economic growth The economic consequences ] could be staggering 25 A TIME magazine headline projected that “NSA Spying Could Cost U.S. Tech Giants Billions,” predicting losses based on the increased scrutiny that economic titans like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Yahoo have faced both at home and abroad since last June. In this section, we examine how emerging evidence about the NSA’s extensive surveillance apparatus has already hurt and will likely continue to hurt the American tech sector in a number of ways The impact of individual users turning away from American companies in favor of foreign alternatives is a concern. major losses will likely result from diminishing confidence in U.S. companies as trustworthy choices for foreign government procurement of products and services and changing behavior in the business-to-business marke . Trust in American businesses has taken a significant hit since the initial reports on the PRISM program suggested that the NSA was directly tapping into the servers of nine U.S. companies to obtain customer data for national security investigations The exact nature of the requests made through the PRISM program was later clarified, but the public attention on the relationship between American companies and the NSA still created a significant trust gap, Last year’s national security leaks have also had a commercial and financial impact on American technology companies that have provided these records,” They have experienced backlash from both American and foreign consumers and have had their competitive standing in the global marketplace damaged it is no surprise that American companies offering cloud computing and webhosting services are among those experiencing the most acute economic fallout from NSA surveillance reports began to emerge that American cloud computing companies like Dropbox and Amazon Web Services were starting to lose business to overseas competitors. An overwhelming number of the companies surveyed indicated that security and data privacy were their top concerns, with 81 percent stating that they “want to know exactly where their data is being hosted.” he Obama Administration’s initial focus on reassuring the public that its programs primarily affect non-Americans, even though non-Americans are also heavy users of American companies’ products. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg put a fine point on the issue, saying that the government “blew it” the U.S. cloud computing industry has grown from an estimated $46 billion in 2008 to $150 billion in 2014, with nearly 50 percent of worldwide cloud-computing revenues coming from the U.S.40 R Street Institute’s January 2014 policy study concluded that in the next few years Economic forecasts after the Snowden leaks have predicted significant, ongoing losses for the cloud-computing industry in the next few years the NSA’s PRISM program could cost the American cloud computing industry $22 to $35 billion over the next three years. a 2012 Gartner study predicted global spending on cloud computing would increase by 100 percent from 2012 to 2016, compared to a 3 percent overall growth rate in the tech industry as a whole Failing to recruit new customers or losing a competitive advantage due to exploitation by rival companies in other countries can quickly lead to a dwindling market share As the R Street Policy Study highlights, “Ironically, the NSA turned the competitive edge U.S. companies have in cloud computing into a liability, especially in Europe.” Staten predicts that as the surveillance landscape around the world becomes more clear, it could have a serious negative impact on all hosting and outsourcing services, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the overall IT services market, or about $180 billion in losses Providing direct evidence of this trend, Servint, a Virginia-based webhosting company, reported in June 2014 that international clients have declined by as much as half, dropping from approximately 60 percent of its business to 30 percent since the leaks began Presenting products and services as ‘NSA-proof’ or ‘safer’ alternatives to American-made goods is an increasingly viable strategy for foreign companies hoping to chip away at U.S. tech competiveness.
drone surveillance in the United States would undoubtedly prove controversial Some Democrats have said the use of drones is hurting America's image overseas Congress has ordered the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to move toward allowing drones to fly alongside commercial aircraft in U.S. airspace by 2015 Law enforcement agencies and state and local governments have expressed a strong interest in unmanned aircraft, and are being courted as potential customers by the booming drone industry There is opposition, from groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) that have raised concerns about the impact of the drones on privacy

near-term action was critical to shoring up our collective defenses the NIST published the finalized version of the first Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity The Framework is exactly that – a framework. It provides a common language and systematic methodology for managing cyber risk. It does not tell a company how much cyber risk is tolerable, nor does it claim to provide “the one and only” formula for cybersecurity. we should not underestimate the power of a common lexicon to enable action across a very diverse set of stakeholders. That’s what will enable the best practices of elite companies to become the standard practices for everyone.¶ The Framework is a first step. We are encouraging voluntary adoption of the Framework. The Framework is a flexible, highly adaptable document we need to improve cyber protections across the broadest set of stakeholders possible to achieve the collective benefit of security for all. The fastest way to do this is through relentlessly encouraging, helping and, where possible, incentivizing, voluntary adoption.¶ This is a strong public-private partnership. Cyber is a team sport, and we need everyone on the field playing their part. The open and collaborative process that we used to develop the Framework represents a good, repeatable process for developing public policy on complex, pervasive technical issues.¶ We need organizations to begin using the Framework and see how well it can work for different sizes and types of organizations.
An alternative chain of logic in the psychological literature focuses on leaders’ reactions to crises in situations of internal political vulnerability, leaders typically weaker and making an easier target than would be expected given a “rational” evaluation of the situation Expectations about the escalation of conflict tinder these conditions are less than clear, however. Following the diversionary argument from a rationalist unitary actor perspective, states engaged in actions to shore up their domestic political situation may not want to pay the costs of a long-running conflict or war, and so we should see less escalation beyond low-level disputes
Every harsh move the Trump administration makes on the southwestern border is designed to deter Central Americans from traveling to the United States. It has drastically restricted who can even ask for asylum. But there is no evidence that the flow of migrants is slowing in response, nor are these people going home. Some wait in hope that U.S. authorities will still grant them a "credible fear" interview to determine if they can even ask for asylum. But that's increasingly unlikely they perceived the risks involved in crossing Mexico to get into the United States as lower than the evident dangers of staying home. For now, they are bottled up within Mexico.
The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP How should the president proceed then Obama’s only remaining option is to pulverize his goal should be to delegitimize his opponents. Through a series of clarifying fights over controversial issues, he can force Republicans to either side with their coalition's most extreme elements or cause a rift in the party that will leave it in disarray. by exploiting the weaknesses of today’s Republican Party, Obama has an opportunity to hasten the demise of the old order by increasing the political cost
Poverty is rising again after a sustained period of decline since 1997 It is still too early to say exactly how much poverty will increase, but it could be by around 10 percentage points Precise figures will be available in August or September, when CONEVAL publishes its biennial statistics in this country of over 107 million people The Mexican economy is one of the hardest hit in the world because of its close trade links with the U S , the origin of the current global crisis The economic crisis impact raise questions about whether Mexico will be able to meet th (MDGs), to cut poverty,
societal confession is important to the redemption of the polity's soul legal and moral wrongs have been done and social sins committed These sins have alienated us from each other through social constructions of race that encourage and condone a legion of subordinating and dehumanizing practices of domination We have chosen the path of denial and silence, a path made inviting by the rhetoric of inalienable rights, equality under the law, and freedom and justice for all Even when afforded the opportunity to make restitution for past mistakes, we have chosen three-fifths compromises, short-lived reconstructions, and anti-affirmative action referenda we have succumbed to the lower angels of our collective nature and sacrificed black equality upon the altars of political expediency - saving the Union, saving the Party, protecting states' rights, and constructing a trans-ethnic solidarity based on whiteness America needs its own Truth and Reconciliation Commission, similar to the South African model in which the stories of victims of oppression and the beneficiaries of oppression can be heard we must acknowledge the ways in which certain social fears like the fears of disunion, competition, retaliation and humiliation have led to the historic atrocities committed against black people in America
market economy status would benefit China by requiring global trade regulators to compare the price of Chinese exports to its domestic market — instead of higher-priced third countries — in anti-dumping cases and thus limiting their ability to impose tariffs.
South Korea is in no way oblivious to the strategic implications of an increasingly powerful China. The ROK calculates that vesting China in an ever larger and increasingly diversified set of relations, , is the most prudent path that it can follow China will always be South Korea’s near neighbor in a divided peninsula The operative tests for it are thus twofold: will China accord Korea full status as a major middle power, and can the ROK successfully impart to Beijing that its core national interests are not negotiable? Seoul clearly understands its distinctive “in between” strategic position. A bridging strategy that attaches enduring importance to relations with the U S while enhancing Korea’s strategic identity and interests through closer ties with China seems self-evident Success in realizing these multiple goals will be the ultimate test of the viability of a bridging strategy, on which Korea’s security and well-being clearly depend
protecting traditional race categories and race-based rights does not come without costs. One cost may be the very thing the traditional civil rights groups feared most from a single multiracial category: movement of more minorities away from a single racial identity and potentially toward white- ness When we talk about changing demographics we must remember that we are in control of how we categorize our popula-tion. Racial ordering is not a natural phenomenon   enough people will be allowed to claim whiteness that the country can maintain a white majority there is reason to expect this definition will continue to change with time. racial performance will undoubtedly continue to inform our legal definitions. Not only are American race categories somewhat meaningless to many immigrants, but to the ex- tent they have meaning it is abundantly clear that immigrants "equate whiteness with opportunity and inclusion another important cost in its final decision is to those who understand themselves as multiracial and who feel that they exist in liminal spaces on official forms, in the national imagination, and in communities and even families This nonrecognition is acknowledged and perhaps exacerbated by the Census Bureau when it re- fers to multiracial people as "The Two or More Races Population not fundamentally changing the categories by which we understand and struggle with race
Politicians are addicted to crime. Democrats, Republicans, liberals and conservatives are all addicted to crime and the politics of fear. a liberal Democrat accused the incumbent of being "soft on crime the phrase itself is toxic. f a liberal Democrat will use "soft on crime" when he thinks it will motivate voters, there is very little hope we will ever be "smart on crime." Soft on crime" is one of those simple phrases that so oversimplify complex issues that they suck the life out of people.  Accusing an opponent of being "soft on crime" is a powerful weapon. It motivates voters by preying on their fears The "soft on crime" charge often works Once elected, they are compelled to do everything they can to show they will never be "soft on crime More prisons get built. Sentences get longer. Parole is denied. Pardons are refused
Kerry raised eyebrows when he met with his Venezuelan counterpart, Foreign Minister Elías Jaua. both sides expressed hope that the reciprocal appointment of ambassadors would take place in short order Despite many fits and starts to advance relations in recent years, genuine improvements in the relationship have been hard to come by. Various U.S. government agencies hold sanctions against elements of the Venezuelan government, And, let’s not forget that the reason there are no ambassadors in Caracas or D.C. was Chávez’s refusal in 2010 to accept Obama’s nominee for the post in Venezuela. Similarly, Venezuela severed ties with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in 2005. On the day Chávez’s death was announced, Maduro, as caretaker, expelled two U.S. air force attachés based in the Caracas embassy, accusing them of espionage. The United States retaliated in kind. Suggestions by members of the Venezuelan government that the United States may have given Chávez the cancer that caused his death have certainly not helped relations either, neither have repeated accusations targeted at former officials and U.S. military and intelligence involvement in countless evidence-free plots. Given the complex reality of the bilateral relationship, it looks like both sides have a long road ahead of them if they seek to enact positive changes.
Republicans have been slashing programs The Freedom Caucus is taking its own party’s budget hostage to demand more and deeper cuts. They have a long list of ways to keep people from getting the help they need
the parody found in drag shows only minimally pushes discursive boundaries. Because drag performers are fetishized by audiences performances lose their subversive quality and their transformative possibilities onlooker generally will not read this performance as subversive. Drag is viewed as mere imitation by heteronormative society and is generally perceived as a spectacle a comedic performance consumed by cultural tourists drag a prime example of subversive mimesis is a limited strategy for sustaining queer heterotopias.
The endless pursuit of economic growth is making us unhappy and risks destroying the Earth’s capacity to sustain us. We live on a finite planet. Earth’s life support systems are self-sustaining and self-regulating. However, we humans are pulling this life support system to pieces. Our planet can absorb a lot of tinkering with its systems, but there are now over 7 billion of us and the amount of energy and resources we are each using is growing That’s a lot of tinkering. There’s plenty of evidence that we are exceeding several we are taking actions that cannot be supported by the earth’s systems in the long term. We’re already exceeding the earth’s adaptive capacity with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss and the nitrogen cycle and we’re approaching critical limits in both the phosphorous cycle and ocean acidification. Our use of fresh water is also approaching or exceeding sustainable limits in many parts of the world and we’re systematically destroying our arable land. These are critical life sustaining global processes that cannot be ignored without severe consequences. reality clashes violently with economic theory. We are showing no signs of decoupling economic growth from physical resource use. continued economic growth will push the planet beyond its capacity to sustain us None of the stuff we’re doing that’s destroying the biosphere is making us happy. we’ve been sold the line that endless growth is essential to maintain and improve our quality of life. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Material prosperity has diminishing returns when it comes to happiness and wellbeing. Once we have good access to basic material things More stuff makes a very marginal difference. Money can’t buy happiness. When rich countries get richer their (SWB) doesn’t necessarily rise.
Military incidents and crises are unfortunately becoming more common in US-China relations the relationship has witnessed the Taiwan Strait crisis EP-3 crisis Kitty Hawk incident  and the Impeccable incident , tensions have intensified in the East and South China Sea Unfortunately, at this point Obama’s rebalancing strategy is in danger of actually enhancing rather than reducing bad security outcomes The rebalancing strategy has many readily identifiable problems, but perhaps the most damaging is its tendency toward militarization the policy has served to justify an impressive parade of weapons programs, as well as an intensified regimen of military exercises The new US policy unnecessarily compounds Beijing’s insecurities and will only feed China’s aggressiveness, undermine regional stability, and decrease the possibility of cooperation between Beijing and Washington Washington has turned to costly initiatives whose force is disproportionate to the threat from China The pivot has not contributed to stability in Asia Quite the opposite: It has made the region more tense and conflict prone The outbreak of hostilities in the region will become a real possibility, as China pushes back Most Chinese foreign policy and defense specialists are convinced that Washington seeks to contain and even derail China’s rise Bilateral tensions have built up in almost all global regions but are most acute in East Asia for now These tensions are deeply rooted The case regarding opportunity costs accruing from major US-China tensions has also been made, including, but hardly limited to, nuclear proliferation, various humanitarian crises and, of course climate change True, some movement is discernible on the critical climate change front But the question that needs to be continually asked is whether more US-China cooperation could be undertaken to address more global challenges Arguments over uninhabited rocks should not distract from these larger imperatives, but that has largely been the case to date, unfortunately Skeptics will inevitably counter that the major cause of East Asian tension is China’s “assertive” behavior However, sophisticated strategists should immediately understand that the attempt to figure out who started it? is a blame game dripping with subjectivity that will not yield any serious conclusions Western analysts, who term contemporary Chinese foreign policy newly assertive not only lack perspective regarding patterns in the Chinese use of force but also appear unable or unwilling to view such accusations in comparative perspective—that is, relative to the rise of other great powers in modern history It will also mean that certain poor, developing countries but also certain developed but strained countries will devote unnecessary sums to developing major weapons systems to deter or fight China versus other national priorities Yet another problem with the “rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific” has been the extent to which it has been pushed and shepherded along by third parties These third parties are regional states concerned to protect the status quo in the face of a rapidly rising China and a U S that is evidently undergoing an identity crisis after two failed conflicts in the Middle East Essentially, leaders and diplomats from various East Asian states have exercised a significant influence on Washington urging it in increasingly desperate tones to stand up to Beijing’s bullying American susceptibility to such arguments reflects an apparent psychological desire to be perceived as playing a vital or “indispensable” role in global security—at bottom, the simple human need to be needed and liked, actually What a pleasant break from vitriolic debates over fiscal and social problems to be told emphatically by East Asian leaders that US moral and strategic leadership is imperative and then to bask in the consequent adulation In any contest with Beijing, these states are perceived as “underdogs,” and they may also benefit from liberal antipathy to the Chinese regime, even though several of these countries cannot actually be termed democracies Then, there is the fact that these small states are frequently more focused on direct policy outcomes and thus are able to successfully apply pressure on US officials, who may hold a less certain and more ambiguous disposition regarding various regional disputes These regional appeals form the demand signal that Obama administration officials claim is the driving force behind the pivot This somewhat subtle and rather insidious diplomacy exercised by various officials from third-party states is not quite irrational, but is certainly shortsighted because their respective countries will hardly benefit from increased US-China tensions Where current US strategists have gravely miscalculated is in reasoning that US national security interests in the Asia-Pacific are simply equivalent to the sum of the concerns of all allies and partners Indeed, the worst outcome of those tensions would certainly be catastrophic for them, because their countries would be the most likely blood-soaked battleground for any US-China military contest In general, these countries are quite mistaken if they think that the American public is prepared to go to war with China over uninhabited rocks Regrettably, it seems that in recent strategic deliberations, Washington has too often been “played” by odious nationalist and parochial interests in these allied and partner states Overall, we may wish to be empathetic to these various regional concerns but we should not confuse this empathy with sound and rational foreign policy A more thoughtful perspective understands that China’s rise will inevitably occasion some anxiety and instability China’s military buildup is largely driven by its historical experience of invasion and vulnerability Beijing has not resorted to the major use of force in more than three decades and most fundamentally, China may quibble over various rocks and reefs with neighbors, but it is emphatically not likely to invade The role of scholars here needs to be to help separate rational and irrational fears and responses Apart from the “free-riding” aspects of current and evolving defense arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region that are disturbing and contrary to US national interests, there is the problem that US partners and allies should benefit US national security and not form a strategic liability that could drag a reluctant Washington into wars over matters of no strategic consequence China is rising into a thicket of strongly capable and strong willed powers that are hardly ready to bend to Beijing’s will all indicated a clear willingness even an eagerness to confront various Chinese claims and policies The argument by various “hawks” that these states will cave to Beijing without robust American backing seems unwarranted Moreover, the further claim that these states would subsequently “bandwagon” with China against the U S is even more grossly misleading there is no possibility that China could turn the tables in the all-important global balance of power against the U S While [China] is strong, it is not that strong and Chinese leaders understand this fact A final deleterious myth propagated by various “hawks” is the notion that any reforms to American strategy and related commitments will inevitably collapse the entire structure of East Asia and even global security This notion is patently false, and the US strategic position has inevitably been strengthened by various adjustments In actuality, alliances and security arrangements are strengthened by reforms that bring their means and goals in conformity with global and regional power and political realities Such reforms would actually help the “credibility” of American commitments the U S should only undertake the resort to arms when actual national interests are at stake and not for the sake of credibility alone It puts America in the curious position of having to go to war to uphold the very credibility that is supposed to obviate war in the first place The abstract fear of dominoes falling does not require that every perceived provocation be fully rebuffed by force Unfortunately, rivalry has a powerful self-reinforcing dynamic that may make the credibility argument seem logical, whether in seeking out new security commitments or within crises The arguments of those pushing for aggressive and noncompromising solutions gain force in a climate of nationalism, xenophobia, and sensationalism, perhaps especially where pithy bloggers or outrageous video clips may outweigh prudence and the careful examination of facts viewed within a larger historical context Smaller countries, moreover, may push their parochial viewpoints, exaggerating the will and capabilities of the superpowers to determine regional outcomes in their favor, pushing the region to the brink of disaster Uniformed personnel on both sides, perhaps driven by a “cult of the offensive,” could argue for greater “forward” deployments and even for “shock and awe”–type destabilizing first strikes In short, the tendencies toward rivalry are multifarious and potent This brings us to the final problem with the rebalancing strategy to the Asia-Pacific It posits no special initiative, institutions, or mechanism to control and mitigate the US-China rivalry that is now developing into full and perilous bloom To the contrary, the strategy feeds upon rivalry and then inflames it further
The Trump economic plan has spawned a bull market in optimism, But a spike in another metric–interest rates–threatens to scuttle the President's pledge to restore American growth many" officials had advocated raising rates "fairly soon the Fed was wary of Trump administration's "expansionary fiscal policy," and its possible impact on the future course of inflation. extra spending means that lenders would get a lot more worried about America's debt and deficits a lot sooner Those same creditors will also fret that the big stimulus will hike inflation, and will demand a cushion in the form of richer yields.  the economy is already near full employment, and many industries are tight on capacity in plants and production facilities. spending will boost the economy, and boost inflation," For the Fed, it's all about inflation." The fear is that the spending will rapidly lift wages because of a shortage of workers, The new administration's hardline stance on illegal immigration could speed up this cycle, by exacerbating the labor shortage. Put together, that's a classic recipe for inflation If a surge in the labor and output doesn't occur, the spike in growth will fade quickly. "You're juicing the economy for a short period,"  A crucial, mainly overlooked driver is the dollar. The greenback is already sitting at lofty levels That combination of circumstances would make our cars and drugs a lot more costly in foreign markets, lowering exports, and dampening growth, and with it, inflation , a weak dollar would exert more downward pressure on prices
Mercenaries are persons who are not members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict but participate in combat primarily for personal gain. They may be authorized to fight by a party to the conflict, but their allegiance to that party is conditioned on monetary payment rather than obedience and loyalty . A mercenary is any person who: (a) Is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict; (b) Does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities; (c) Is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party; Under this definition, it appears that contractor personnel who are not U.S. nationals, the nationals of other coalition allies or nationals of the host country, and who were hired to—and in fact do—take part in hostilities might be considered to be mercenaries, assuming the definition in Protocol I applies as customary international law in the context of the current hostilities
There are multiple dimensions to the definition of “human rights,” but when evoked in relation to China by the Western media, the phrase is invariably meant as a reminder of what China is lacking Western, especially U.S., journalism has identified human rights as the way to make any mainland Chinese story newsworthy In the reports that regularly come to the attention of the U.S. public about political dissidents the Chinese government’s participation in the trading of body parts from executed prisoners, and about the continued prohibition of public discussions of democracy one thing looms large the fraught relationship between what seems to be a universal issue (human rights) and the specifics of a local, particular culture (China). whereas the West asserts its moral claims on the basis of a universalist rhetoric China is reduced to a reactive position from which it must and can speak only in terms of its own cultural and local specifics This typical discursive scenario amounts to a division of cultural labor on the international scene; it is one that hardly needs to be elaborated but badly needs to be challenged. Instead of viewing one party, the West, as the holder of some absolute value and the other, China, as a stubborn, wayward resister to all that is reasonable, it would be more pro­ductive, in light of Foucault’s notion of biopower, to view the West and China as collaborative partners in an ongoing series of biopolitical trans­actions in global late capitalism transactions whereby human rights, or humans as such, are the commodity par excellence. In exiling its political dissidents in single file, while others continue to be arrested and imprisoned,2 the mainland Chinese government is setting itself up as a business enterprise that deals in politicized human persons as precious commodities, the release of which, as the logic of commodification goes, is systematically regulated by the rules of demand and supply and by the continued presence of an interested buyer. It is as if China must act in good faith by constantly maintaining a supply of the goods being demanded by the West. As some prisoners are traded off, others need be caught and put away in order to replenish the national stockpile, so that transactions can proceed periodically to the satisfac­tion of the trading parties human rights can no longer be understood pure­ly on humanitarian grounds but rather must also be seen as an inherent part—entirely brutal yet also entirely logical—of transnational corpo­ratism, under which anything, including human beings can become exchangeable for its negotiated equivalent val­ue By releasing its political prisoners who can be seen as a kind of national product in a regulated manner, the Chinese authorities ac­complish the pragmatic goal of forcing Western nations to soften their rhetoric against China and thus of receiving more trading privileges and opportunities over time the Chinese are not the only ones to benefit from such releases. Western companies also stand to gain substantially from the Chinese government’s calcu­lated moves the “humane” release of famous dissidents arises from the same cold-blooded logic of economic trans­actions as what only appears to be its opposite, the egregious, abusive trading of organs from slaughtered Chinese prisoners The two kinds of trades form a diversified but cohesive globalized financial or­der: when dead, humans are exchanged in the form of replaceable body parts; when still alive, they are exchanged whole for lucrative long-term trading arrangements that benefit the entire nation. The ostensible trade in nonhuman commodities between China and the West is concurrently facilitated by this other, unmentionable trade in humans as commodities.
while the human rights conditions placed upon the release of 15% of the funding for Plan Merida are good in theory, Mexico does not meet the criteria. the government simply disregards them an investment in security is not enough because of poverty and corruption in Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) exacerbated poverty in Mexico, displaced two million small farmers, and dramatically increased migration to the United States so people could earn a living investment in Mexico’s economic development is key to dismantling the power of cartels, especially in terms of creating jobs Jereski critiques the Merida Initiative as “a response to the mobilization against the poverty and other social, cultural, and economic dislocations caused by NAFTA.”
There hasn’t been any official indication from the Trump administration that the tweet is correct, but frankly there are few agencies more worthy of elimination than the one in question. Keith Moore, who led the bureau from 2010-12. He told me it was “an inefficient, ineffective, poorly structured bureaucracy,” The first problem he sees is purely structural: The Bureau of Indian Education is part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, not the Education Department it was hard to track how the dollars were spent when they were allocated by Congress. Only about 7% of Native children attended BIE schools in 2013, according to Education Week. That’s approximately 48,000 students at 183 schools. The education they receive is abysmal. The problem is not a lack of funding. Bureau of Indian Education schools spent approximately $20,000 per pupil in 2014, according to an analysis by the Cato Institute, compared with a national average of $12,400. Even so, their graduation rate is 53% compared with a national average of 81%. he agency has done nothing to follow-up on the evidence, either by conducting second audits to determine the weaknesses of the schools’ financial controls, or to sanction the schools and tribes that operate them for the malfeasance.” Given the management problems at the agency, the situation is hardly surprising. But schools run by tribes, or state-run public schools near reservations, don’t offer much better education. Many schools are plagued by violence and a shortage of teachers. Put another way, schools are a jobs program that Native leaders don’t want to lose. Even if they were inclined to change, it’s hard to imagine where a geographically isolated tribe like the Havasupai will find qualified teachers. The system that we have been using is tired. The teachers are helpless to control their work environments. They just do what they have to rather than being active in changing things.
The White House is preparing a directive that would require federal agencies to publicly disclose for the first time where they fly drones in the United States and what they do with the torrents of data collected from aerial surveillance.¶ The presidential executive order would force the Pentagon, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies to reveal more details about the size and surveillance capabilities of their growing drone fleets — information that until now has been largely kept under wraps.¶ We’re undergoing a quiet revolution in aerial surveillance,” said Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. Most affected by the executive order would be the Pentagon, which conducts drone training missions in most states, and Homeland Security, which flies surveillance drones along the nation’s borders round-the-clock. It would also cover other agencies with little-known drone programs, including NASA, the Interior Department and the Commerce Department. Until now, the armed forces and federal law enforcement agencies have been reflexively secretive about drone flights and even less forthcoming about how often they use the aircraft to conduct domestic surveillance.
e blood-sucking capitalist class fights (vainly) to dominate the creative-productive working class. If Marxist revolutionaries can bring down the center of capitalism, the United States, world-history will supposedly begin its Golden Age. This myth is so attractive to many people because it portrays in social-class terms the problems that each individual must face. A person committed to the revolutionary cause can through this projection postpone the painful process of their own individuation.
The US Navy is unable to meet its commitment to field two carrier strike groups, with another three able to surge Even if full funding is restored leaders have said it would be at least 2018 before the Navy would be able to regain those operational readiness levels. Gaps in carrier coverage threaten to undermine the US ability to deter conflict shortages will continue, and the fleet will remain at 10 ships for the time being, rather than the 11-ship fleet mandated by Congress. today we have 10 We have more in depot maintenance today than we would normally have under a stable operational cycle. So we have a shortfall in our ability to generate the forces we need.” America’s super carrier size is hard to justify as the carrier air wings they host have shrunk that number is more like 60 aircraft, many of which have direct commonality with one another. The idea is not to replace the super carrier entirely with more plentiful and less expensive smaller carriers, but to replace a portion of the super carrier fleet as they retire. Just the cost of building a super carrier has ballooned affording one-for-one replacements of the existing carrier fleet could crush the Navy’s ship-building budget, especially with other uncertain fleet priorities looming, like replacing the Ohio Class of submarines. For less than the cost of one Ford Class super carrier, the U.S. Navy could purchase two Queen Elizabeth Class carriers. Even with U.S. modifications these ships could very well cost even less than what they do today as the baseline research and development costs would have largely been already paid for by the British Ministry of Defense. If we could replace every other super carrier with two modified Queen Elizabeth class carriers, we could drastically increase our carrier force’s flexibility savings garnered by building smaller carriers could be reallocated to adapting to such a new way of doing business. By building smaller carriers Navy commanders will be able to better pair their available resources with the mission at hand. you do not need a super carrier for simply creating a strong presence in a region smaller carriers would provide everything a super carrier could, although at diminished sortie rates. For missions where a super carrier’s capability is needed, and if none are available, two smaller carriers can be deployed in one’s place. A one-size-fits-all being extra-large, approach to America’s carrier force will likely be unsustainable in the coming decades. With America’s Navy having to be in more places at one time than ever, breaking the old super-carrier or bust mold will be essential for meeting the mission demands of the future.
The figuration of the underdeveloped/non-white/non-Western as being trapped in a state of arrested development, needing to be rescued by the white Westerner, is further exemplified in relation to their gendered perversions. the non-white/non-Western woman is characterised as a helpless, oppressed creature who, with the help of her white Western ‘sisters’ must break the shackles of her cultural imprisonment in order to become a developed liberal feminist and join the ‘correct’ path towards developed civilisation Western feminists instead appear to have adapted Spivak’s observation from ‘white men saving brown women from brown men’ to ‘white women saving their brown sisters from brown men.’ women living in the developing world are figured as gendered, as well as racial, failures. This is often seen in relation to the underdeveloped woman as the subject of sexual oppression, their sexual life controlled and dictated by (brown) men and on the other, as inherently over-sexed and sexually perverse in nature. These contradictory figurations of the underdeveloped as both sexually oppressed and sexually degenerate can also be noted in relation to Western perceptions of the (homo)sexuality of the underdeveloped, where the underdeveloped is figured as sexually perverse, both in terms of sexual deviance and in terms of lacking sexual enlightenment. ‘decadence and degeneracy…are both developmental tropes…what the decadent/degenerate shares with the primitive is a position on the fringes of the normative evolutionary narrative’ Homosexuality is consistently linked to the underdeveloped; once again we return to this notion of arrested development in which ‘the homosexual is the figure of arrested development of the heterosexual, as the primitive is the figure of arrested development of the civilised’ HIV prevalence rates in sub-Saharan Africa as the consequence of a ‘hidden homosexuality.’ the underdeveloped is portrayed in need of development through this narrative of their lacking sexual enlightenment and tolerance. In contrast to the ‘gay-friendly’ West, the developing world is inherently homophobic, yet another sign in Western eyes that the Third World is in need of development. The West has adopted attitudes to homosexuality as a marker of how developed a nation is; you are less developed than us because you treat your gays badly. Thus the western state becomes guarantor of lesbian and gay rights versus the threat constituted by the savage brutal other’ Western nations conveniently ignore issues of homophobia that still rage within their own borders, as well as the fact that the homophobia of the underdeveloped world has its roots in colonialism and the spread of traditional Christian moralities in the Third World and that homophobia may have been exported through colonialism he Western world expresses its whiteness as a ‘badge of superiority’ in which their supposed tolerance of homosexuality elevates them to the position of the ‘developed world’, and the non-Western world is in need of development because they apply no such tolerance. These figurations o of the Western world to fortify its hegemonic position as ‘developed’, and the non-Western/non-white world as ‘underdeveloped’, regardless of the often contradictory and hypocritical nature of the ways in which the underdeveloped is figured as in need of development.
Latin America is increasingly attractive as a source for large emerging economies like China Latin America produces 47 percent of the world’s soybean crop, 40 percent of copper and 9 percent of its crude oil China needs such commodities as inputs in fast industrialization process and private consumption oil and copper import growth rates have been 10 times higher than average
Rarely has a controversial government program been so fiercely debated and so poorly understood. their case against the program becomes so much less compelling upon fleeting contact with reality. metadata is stored in a database that may be searched only by a handful of trained employees, and even they may search it only after a judge has determined that there is evidence connecting a specific phone number to terrorism. Not only is there zero evidence of any such abuse, it isn’t even possible based on the NSA database alone. There are no names with the numbers The NSA is hardly a rogue agency. Its program is overseen by a special panel of judges, and it has briefed Congress about its program for years. In the context of all that is known about us by private companies, the NSA is a piker. The Supreme Court has held that you don’t have an expectation of privacy for such information in the possession of a third party. They aren’t violating anyone’s Fourth Amendment rights the program doesn’t deserve the ignominy that has it in such political peril. The House has passed a reform that might render the program unworkable
1. Parolees Have Not "Attempted to Evade the Consular Visa Process." The agencies should not assume that parolees "have attempted to evade the consular visa process" or have been in a position in which they "could have and should have sought and obtained an immigrant visa On the contrary, parole is only granted by the favorable discretion of the Secretary of DHS "for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit." as the American Immigration Law Foundation ("AILF") n190 pointed out submitted to the agencies on the proposed regulations, "the very fact that the individual was granted parole in the discretion of the government indicates that the individual had a legitimate humanitarian or public interest reason for seeking entry into the United States" and, thus the purpose of the individual's coming to the U.S. was this recognized humanitarian or public interest, not any attempt to circumvent the visa process. n191 One need only look to the factual circumstances surrounding situations of parolees to see that this group of aliens did not enter the United States attempting to evade the consular visa process. most often been granted to aliens fleeing unsettled conditions in their own country, when refugee status has not been granted for whatever reason." granted in a number of other circumstances that have nothing to do with an alien's attempt to evade the traditional consular visa process the assertion that parolees are typically aliens who attempted to circumvent the traditional immigration process is incorrect.
Latin American countries have spoken out against inequalities of responsibility. They urge industrialized countries to assume full responsibility to reverse defacement of the environment industrialized nations have the resources and the room for change. The US should demonstrate its willingness to pay the price for the toll it takes on the international environment. compliance with NEPA when acting abroad would lend much integrity to US actions and decisions and would strengthen its "political and moral force by eliminating the double standard that honesty is warranted at home, but not abroad. the absence of an EIS permits the export of environmentally unsound practices Applying NEPA is an important step
In the military realm, there are other factors that are already driving the US and China towards greater strategic competition. China is developing capabilities that are aimed at denying the US Navy easy access in a crisis to its near seas - the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea - which occupy significant portions of the Western Pacific. From China's perspective this is a defensive strategy that is referred to in Chinese writings as aimed at "counter-intervention". The US views the development of these capabilities, which it terms "anti-access/area denial", as threatening its ability to protect its interests in the Asia-Pacific, including defending its allies To ensure that it can maintain freedom of access and manoeuvre in the waters around China, the US is applying operational concepts such as Air-Sea Battle. Even US-China military exchanges and joint exercises have increased despite their growing competition for sea control in the waters around China However, if this competition becomes more intense, US-China cooperation in the Asia-Pacific may become impossible. And if China were to employ its anti-accès s/area-denial weapons to warn or intimidate the US, the US would likely respond, and tensions could escalate rapidly.
Nevertheless, half or more of the public in 33 of 44 nations surveyed still think that Washington safeguards Americans’ freedoms. The U.S. image as a protector of personal liberties remains quite strong in many societies, the younger generation is much more likely than their elders to see the U.S. as a defender of domestic liberties
I heartily commend this evangelical-libertarian coalition that created the Right on Crime movement . But liberal politicians have been too afraid of the soft-on-crime label to associate themselves with the reform movement; in fact, Democrats built careers on out-toughing the conservatives. Real political change required a bi-partisan approach, and this meant that the impetus for reform had to come from the political right. Democrats will vote for change, but only if conservatives give them political cover.
They're quick to note that Obama included the postal reform provision in his latest budget blueprint "Given the limited window for action, we believe it is important that an offset be simple and have the support of the administration and congressional Republicans Republicans are playing a "zero-sum game" by eliminating one program, The Obama administration is pushing an alternative plan that fills the trust fund for four years
the Middle East is best explained by the neo- realist or realist paradigm, due to the absence of strong institutions, the lack of a normative framework guiding the interaction of the Middle East states, and the Machiavellian nature of its politics. the Middle East lacks a consensus on the hierarchy of states, . No such order and normative framework exist in the Middle East. Many of its states are new to statecraft and the system has yet to reach equilibrium; in this case, neither the hierarchy for role nor relative power has been set-everything is up for grabs Many states can be characterized as anti-status quo states that actively seek to keep their options open by undermining any possible equilibrium the lack of a normative framework creates an atmosphere in which states often resort to instigation of instability in neighboring states and support for terrorist groups and secessionist movements These factors all make the Middle East suitable for explanation through the power cycle theory
Brazilian President indictment of the U S cyberspying practices has global repercussions for a borderless, open Internet. this backlash is being fueled not by democracies that oppose American ideals, but by allies that resent Washington’s betrayal of its own vision Rousseff’s move could lead to a powerful chorus that would transform the Internet from a global commons to a fractured patchwork severely limited by political boundaries The NSA’s actions have shifted that debate, alienating key Internet-freedom allies and emboldening the most repressive regimes on the planet close allies are now considering revoking data-sharing agreements with the U S and requiring American website providers to prominently warn Europeans that their data is subject to surveillance repressive regimes are wresting control of information over their networks, poisoning popular applications and services, and undermining the foundations for the Internet’s open, interconnected structure the Internet is in danger of becoming like the European train system, where varying voltage and signaling technologies force operators to stop and switch systems or even to another locomotive, resulting in delays, inefficiencies, and higher costs The NSA has opened a Pandora’s box Its rules impose geo-locational-based jurisdictional mandates They also include requirements based upon ownership; the location of a company’s headquarters may lead to surveillance mandates covering services and infrastructure in other countries. This creates tremendous technical challenges for startups and entrepreneurs stifling innovation Fracturing the Internet undermines Internet freedom as well Brazil may not be pressing to assert control over everything online or censor its own people but plenty of other countries with darker motives are cheering Brazil on. The U.S. has done a disservice to all people already living and working under repressive regimes by creating a new international norm that massive-scale surveillance is acceptable It’s time for bold leadership to defend our core principles. Reforms need to go far beyond pro-forma reviews carried out by intelligence and administration insiders As a country, we agreed to stop atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, not to stockpile or deploy chemical weapons, and not to militarize outer space Today we need to curtail surveillance and covert hacking. Only by being radically transparent will we regain global trust and shift the rather bleak trajectory we are currently on
Could a U.S. threat that it might interfere with a rogue state’s nuclear weapon delivery help shape a nuclear confrontation? The U S has a robust cyberattack capability from which the rogue state’s nuclear arsenal is not provably immune. the rogue state is willing to go to the nuclear brink it may act in ways that are irrational by Western perspectives. the U S creates the belief that the rogue state cannot carry out its nuclear threat. a flaw somewhere in the nuclear command-and-control cycle prevents immediate nuclear use. the U S could delay a weapon’s use. A temporary advantage may give the U S time to cross the red line and thereby attain a fait accompli. the U S prepares to cross the red line, while communicating its confidence that the rogue state will not retaliate. This confidence stems from a combination of its nuclear deterrence plus ability to confound the rogue state’s nuclear capability: The rogue nuclear state probably will not decide to retaliate, and probably cannot retaliate. The combination is what reduces the odds of a nuclear response to a sufficiently low level
It is in this context that the events in India’s neighborhood have caused anxiety and have led to calls for a new space policy aimed at countering the growing might of China’s space military program. Hazardous space debris aside, the test also confirmed China’s capability to attack and destroy enemy satellites in the event of war, sabotaging the enemy’s military operations. Such developments have not gone unnoticed in New Delhi’s defense establishment. Security experts and scholars have called for a rethink of India’s space policy, augmenting India’s ASAT weapons capability. F India has all the building blocks in place to integrate an anti-satellite weapon to neutralize hostile satellites in low earth and polar orbits the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) now has the capability to launch satellites weighing in excess of two tons, an important prerequisite for the deployment of any weapons system. Questioning India’s “purported” capabilities, scholars like Michael Listner and Victoria Samson have pointed out that without conducting a test and demonstrating its ASAT capability explicitly, India will only be seen as a “paper tiger” by the arms control and intelligence community India’s scientific community is open to an ASAT test, if it was done with caution Even if New Delhi does have an anti-satellite weapons capability, it will only be acknowledged if it comes out in the open with a successful tes It should be remembered that along with causing grave insecurity, and possibly a space-weaponization race in the region, such a test will also lead to the creation of hazardous space debris, which could doubtless elicit international opprobrium, and possibly even sanctions which even led to the signing of the 2005 India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement and made India the first country with nuclear weapons which is not a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), but still allowed to carry out nuclear commerce with a nuclear weapons state — could end in jeopardy if India unilaterally tests ASAT weapons such a move could stall such developments as investors would see the tests as a sign of aggression and defiance of international norms. Additionally, for India to establish its defense-industrial base, it needs the transfer of technology from technologically advanced nations. If New Delhi decides to go ahead with ASAT tests, it will possibly be looking at sanctions
Significant challenges to offshore wind power deployment related to resource characterization, grid interconnection and operation, and infrastructure will need to be overcome. The offshore wind resource is not well characterized This increases uncertainty related to potential project power production and turbine and array design considerations which increase financing costs The implications for adding large amounts of offshore wind generation to the power system need to be better understood with current technology cost ‐ effective installation of offshore wind turbines requires specialized vessels purpose ‐ built portside infrastructure, robust undersea electricity transmission lines, and grid interconnections These vessels and this infrastructure do not currently exist in the U.S the Jones Act limits the ability of these vessels to operate in U.S. waters.
the U.S. government has funneled billions of dollars into Mexico with the stated intent “to fight organized crime and associated violence while furthering respect for human rights and the rule of law.” the United States has also approved the transfer through sales of billions of dollars’ worth of other arms to the Mexican government Whatever the pretext or mode of delivery, the evidence is strong that such U.S. military transfers contribute significantly to violence, instability, and the denial of human rights Because of the depth of corruption in the Mexican government, police and armed forces blur the lines between official groups and criminals, and legal arms sales frequently end up arming criminal gangs and criminal conduct directly. Moreover, the Mexican police and military have a long history of repression against mostly peaceful social movements In 2013 alone, the United States exported to Mexico 5,810 revolvers and pistols, 7,223 rifles, 30 assault rifles, 1,311 machine guns, 7,145 shotguns, 34 grenade launchers, and 20 anti-tank missile launchers Among these weapons were U.S.-produced and exported rifles used by the police who attacked and handed over 43 student teachers from Ayotzinapa to a local criminal gang in September 2014 Documents include the weapons possessed by municipal police in Iguala, who carried out the crime. Among the arms listed: 20 assault rifles produced by Colt’s Manufacturing headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut U.S. Embassy staff assured us that police who are shown to have committed grave human rights abuses are barred from receiving U.S. training. But the restriction apparently does not apply to police receiving U.S.-exported weapons An increasing amount of arms sales to Mexico are made directly by the United States government, through its Foreign Military Sales program  one can’t talk about arms in Mexico without talking about the United States. Seventy percent of firearms seized in criminal investigations in Mexico come from the U.S.
China’s economy stabilized last quarter and gathered pace in March as a surge in new credit spurred a property sector rebound while raising fresh questions over the sustainability of the debt-fueled expansion. Gross domestic product rose 6.7 percent in the first quarter , meeting the median projection and in line with the government’s growth target of 6.5 percent to 7 percent for the full year. New credit, industrial output, fixed-asset investment and retail sales picked up The economy has stabilized thanks to a flood of liquidity and improved sentiment in the property market,
the structural drivers of U.S.-China competition are too deep to resolve through cooperative engagement policymakers must instead accept the reality of strategic rivalry and aim to manage it at a lower level of intensity Rising tensions between China and the U.S. have spurred fears that the two countries could end up in conflict or recreate the Cold War Conflict is not inevitable, however, and aggressive strategies that unnecessarily aggravate the sources of rivalry are likely to prove dangerously counterproductive. The best option at this point is, paradoxically, for the U.S. to accept the reality of the growing strategic rivalry and manage it at a lower level of intensity. • Maintaining a technological edge is critical for the U.S. to successfully manage the rivalry with China. Policies should be pursued to ensure that the U.S. continues to attract and nurture the best science and technology talent and retains its status as the global leader in technology The United States and China find themselves increasingly enmeshed in a strategic rivalry To be sure, disagreements between the two countries have gained widespread attention. Disputes involving Chinese confrontations with U.S. allies and partners such as Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan have frequently grabbed the headlines disagreements over Chinese trade practices and U.S. military activities in the South China Sea have occasioned discord. All these sources of conflict are genuine, but they mask the main drivers of rivalry, which are twofold First, the United States and China are locked in a contest for primacy—most clearly in Asia and probably globally as well. The United States has been the dominant power, and China seeks to eventually supplant it. By definition, two different states cannot simultaneously share primacy at either the regional or global level. Second, economic, demographic, and military trajectories suggest that China has the potential to contend in a significant way for leadership at the global systemic level. At this level, the most decisive competition will be for technological leadership Should China supplant the United States as the world’s premier country in terms of technology, its claim to regional and global supremacy will be difficult to deny And once it has gained that supremacy, China will be well positioned to restructure institutional arrangements to privilege itself and disadvantage the United States. Although this competition is occurring simultaneously at both levels, observers have focused primarily on the struggle for primacy at the regional level and overlooked or downplayed the competition at the global systemic level Donald Trump may have abandoned the rebalance, but many of the related initiatives remain more or less in place China’s challenge at the global systemic level, especially in the field of technology, has received less attention Confidence in the proven U.S. ability to produce new technologies and facile assumptions about the difficulties China will face in promoting innovation in new industries have led many to dismiss the challenge posed by China. But the contest for technological leadership is actually even more consequential than that for regional primacy Should China succeed in surpassing the United States as the world’s technological leader, U.S. diplomacy and military power will not suffice to hold the line either in Asia or around the globe Military power projection could be far less relevant as China moves to consolidate its leading status at both the regional and global levels in such a scenario although the United States must step up its efforts to strengthen its faltering lead in new technology development While China clearly grasps the stakes, it is not clear that the United States does. while the U.S. government seeks to restrict immigration and discourage foreign students from attending U.S. universities (and staying after they receive their advanced training), China has revised its policies to welcome foreigners, prioritizing those with science and technology expertise. the United States has lost its once-undisputed lead in the per capita number of engineers and scientists Strains between China and the United States have deepened in the past few years over a proliferating array of issues Trump has stepped up accusations against China of unfair trade practices and inadequate pressure on North Korea. increasing official contacts with Taiwan disputes add to tensions that had expanded under Obama The baleful state of bilateral relations has spurred plenty of finger-pointing On the Chinese side, officials denounce the United States’ “Cold War mindset” and warn of conflict if Washington does not adjust its policies Military officials and many Chinese analysts regard increasing tension between the two countries as unavoidable, although they do not regard war as likely Western officials and commentators tend to blame China for current strains. criticized “assertive” Chinese behavior, while some analysts blame Xi Jinping for pushing a more confrontational set of policies Other Western observers worry that a further souring of relations could lead to conflict the deepening tensions increase the risks of miscalculation, crises, and potential military clashes involving the world’s two largest powers former CIA director General Michael Hayden has warned that mishandling the U.S.-China relationship could be “catastrophic.” This widespread concern reflects a realistic appraisal of the dangers inherent in the U.S.-China relationship. Analysts have established, that rivalry is perhaps the most important driver of interstate conflict. rivals” are states that regard each other as “enemies,” sources of real or potential threat, and as competitors. At the root of rivalries thus lie disputes over incompatible goals and perceptions that countries possess both the ability (real or potential) and the intention to harm each other Wars have historically tended to be fought by pairings of these states and their allies. Rivals have opposed in over 90% of wars since 1945 Not only are rivals more likely to fight than non-rivals, but rivals also have a tendency to be recidivists because they are unable to resolve their political differences on the battlefield Rivals that cannot prevail due to parity frequently compete for advantage by building internal strength through arms racing or by leveraging external power through the strengthening of alliances and partnerships. prone to serial militarized crises Mutual perceptions of each other as hostile enemies and the inconclusive outcome of previous militarized disputes typically fuel a pattern of recurrent crises characterized by deepening resentment, distrust, and growing willingness to risk escalation. Studies have also established that the risk of conflict increases sharply after three episodes of militarized crises. Rivalries do not progress in a linear direction Their intensity can wax and wane in response to shocks and other important developments. Periods of relative stability can alternate with turbulent periods of tension and conflict one can describe the Sino-U.S. relationship as a rivalry characterized as a competition between two major powers over incompatible goals regarding their status, leadership, and influence over a particular region—in this case principally the Asia-Pacific The dynamics of this type of strategic rivalry differ in significant ways from the far more numerous rivalries over territory Strategic rivalries among major powers tend to be especially long-lived, The U.S.-China rivalry, for instance, is already both a regional and, , a global rivalry but there is still considerable room for competition to expand. strategic rivalries extremely crisis- and conflict-prone come in a grim package deal that includes strained and hostile relations, serial crises, and in some cases wars. historically occasioned the most destructive wars How did the two countries arrive at this position? China’s rapid economic growth has provided the resources with which it can press demands on long unresolved issues such as unification with Taiwan The persistence of long-standing sources of antagonism, such as the U.S. security partnership with Taiwan, has both reflected and aggravated a broader competition for leadership “Thucydides trap” What distinguishes the rivalry today from that of the earlier period is both the closer parity in relative power—albeit still more potential than real—between the two countries and the comprehensiveness, complexity, and systemic nature of the disputes between them. Paradoxically, these features make the current rivalry potentially far more threatening to the United States, the risk that China could rise to the position of global system leader and subordinate the United States accordingly struggles for global leadership have historically proved to be especially destructive . The possibility that China and the United States could find themselves in a similar struggle, cannot be ruled out given the reality of the relative decline in U.S. power and the concomitant increase in Chinese comprehensive national power. China is seeking to revise aspects of the regional and international order that it regards as obstacles to the country’s revitalization as a great power. The main theater of this competition for influence and leadership is the Asia-Pacific, , but U.S.-China rivalry increasingly is expanding globally. the u.s.-china rivalry at the regional level the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis elevated the potential threat of conflict between the two countries In 2011, the United States announced its rebalance to Asia, which was aimed in part at shoring up U.S. alliances, partnerships, and influence Although on the surface Washington has abandoned the effort, the Trump administration has reintroduced a vision for Asia’s economic and security order premised on values favorable to U.S. interests Beijing , has increased its efforts to advance a vision for a regional order premised on Chinese leadership. China has promoted major economic and geostrategic initiatives to deepen Asia’s economic integration through the Belt and Road Initiative, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and other initiatives Militarily, the growing arms race and the establishment of rival security institutions stand among the most obvious manifestations of an increasing competition in this domain The PLA has developed weapons systems to counter potential U.S. intervention in any contingency along China’s periphery, which the United States has in turn sought to counter with its own innovations, the U.S.-China strategic rivalry overlaps with an even more antagonistic competition between China and Japan over a broad array of issues, including the territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Vietnam and the Philippines have sought closer security relations with the United States as their disputes with China in the South China Sea have intensified At the global systemic level, the narrowing gap in comprehensive national power underpins a proliferating array of potential disputes across political, economic, and military issues In the competition for leadership at the global level, the critical contest does not concern which country possesses the largest economy, the most powerful military, or even the most “soft power,” Between the two large and powerful countries, the decisive issue is which country controls the most technologically proficient economy. The Importance of Technological Leadership Why is technological predominance so important? The first, most fundamental reason is that long-term economic growth is predicated on generating radical new technologies In due time, the world economy’s leading innovator is likely to extend its lead to commercial, financial, and military areas as well Second, mastering surges in new technologies maintains the most competitive and lucrative position in the global economy. gains made in the civilian economy can be transferred to military technology. basic research at universities has traditionally fueled advances in weapons technologies. Third, technological predominance generates huge economic gains because corporations in the leading economy are set up to dominate new markets in the new industries. encouraged countries around the world to look to the United States as a leader, fourth technological predominance fuels the soft power that makes the leading economy attractive. The accelerated rate of technology transfer and energy consumption in the 21st century, however, has considerably weakened this lead. Asia has made rapid gains that pose a challenge to U.S. technological leadership For now China continues to lag behind the United States. But Chinese officials have made technological leadership a key policy priority and are investing enormous sums of time and money accordingly. The result is that analysts now debate whether China could at some point surpass the United States to become the world leader in technological innovation Competition in Other Domains United States and China have also intensified competition across the economic and security domains. China poses a lesser challenge at the global level in these domains, but the situation could change if China wins the competition at the regional level and secures the lead position in technology China has begun to pursue more technologically advanced manufacturing capabilities similar to those of the United States. The economic relationship is thus becoming less complementary and more competitive Militarily, the United States retains superiority at the global level, but its advantage in a potential conventional conflict in the Indo-Pacific has eroded China’s expanding inventory of weapons across all domains increases the likelihood that any conventional conflict that begins in Asia might expand worldwide the proliferating points of potential interaction with the military forces of the United States and its allies should be evaluated against the background of an economic, political, and military competition that may intensify in coming years. China’s increasingly global interests and capabilities open possibilities for militarized disputes and crises around the world in coming decades U.S.-China strategic rivalry still possesses considerable room for further expansion. China remains in the early years of major initiatives and reforms to increase its economic competitiveness, improve its military’s reach and lethality, and promote Chinese culture, political values, and ideals rivalry Is it possible to shift the fundamental drivers of the U.S.-China relationship from rivalry to cooperation and thereby remove the risk of conflict? proposals to encourage cooperation focus on the most highprofile flashpoints such as Taiwan and the South China Sea. But since the proposals do not address the multilevel competition for leadership at the heart of the current rivalry, they are unlikely to significantly reduce the risks of systemic warfare Ironically, some of the proposals, if implemented, could incite a more dangerous rivalry by enabling China’s consolidation of regional and technological leadership and thereby facilitating its ability to contest U.S. leadership at the global level Research has generated inconclusive or inadequate support for the idea that restraining influences such as democratization, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), trade interdependence, and nuclear deterrence can terminate a strategic rivalry. Mutual trade dependence the growing attractiveness of protectionist policies to Washington and increased tensions over a variety of trade issues have already spurred an escalating dispute between the two countries In sum, the rivalry between China and the United States will likely continue until one country concludes that it cannot win the competition and accedes to the leadership of the other. Another possibility is that one side concludes that the other side has lost the ability to compete or no longer threatens the other. Sino-U.S. strategic competition is here to stay, and it could last many years, potentially even decades. Aggressive Competitive Approaches Are Counterproductive mistakenly assumes that all rivalries share the same levels of hostility and threat In reality, not all rivalries are alike. Those rivalries that carry high levels of hostility, threat, and competition tend to feature high risks of conflict. Indeed, policies that focus on containing or subverting the adversary, or that aim to mobilize the public against China, risk driving the rivalry to resemble the more antagonistic, dangerous variety of the Cold War. analysts should regard high-profile flashpoints such as Taiwan or disputed reefs in the East and South China Seas as merely the most visible manifestations of a systemic rivalry rather than the sole or even primary driver These flashpoints represent the metaphorical tip of the iceberg, beneath which lies a large array of interrelated, complex disputes fueled at bottom by a competition for leadership and status at the regional and global levels Resolving a single flashpoint thus offers little prospect of ending the competition Each dispute has its own dangerous possibility of escalatory policy responses, but more damaging is the potential compounding effect that various disputes could play in reinforcing hostile sentiments and mobilizing the populations of the two countries against each other raising the risk of miscalculation and escalatory responses The scene would be set for a spiraling of militarized crises, brinksmanship, and clashes The most effective response to the evolving situation is to acknowledge that the U.S.-China relationship will remain a strategic rivalry for years to come and to manage its unique dynamics accordingly. The starting point for rivalry management is to discourage China from contesting U.S. global systemic leadership by strengthening the United States’ technological advantage Technological leadership has historically proved to be a critical driver of systemic competition To discourage China from seeking leadership of the global system, the United States should enact policies that strengthen its technological advantages . Unless it stems further relative decline, the only thing that will discourage challenges to U.S. leadership in the future would be the failure of China to generate economic growth through technological innovation Any particular crisis or clash involving Chinese and U.S. military forces threatens to accelerate competition and interstate hostility, and thereby drive relations toward a dangerous systemic confrontation. The good news is that history does afford examples of rivalries ending peacefully, among which the Cold War is a recent example. some Chinese thinkers have similarly argued for strategies to manage the rivalry in a peaceful manner. Yan Xuetong recommended that China “create and build an international relations theory for peaceful rivalry” in order to “prevent the escalation of China-U.S. strategic rivalry.” Liu Jianhua similarly concluded that U.S.-China relations have entered a “quasi–Cold War” state featuring “more competition and less cooperation” and “more enmity than friendship.” He recommended measures to stabilize the competition and normalize crisis control and management mechanisms.78 Efforts to end the U.S.-China strategic rivalry through grand bargains, shared leadership, or Cold War–style competitive approaches all risk exacerbating the rivalry and elevating the likelihood of systemic warfare. will require more attention to sustaining the U.S. edge in global technological leadership a stable relationship of critical importance to the health of the global economy and the security of the world can be fostered. Considering the disastrous possibilities if the rivalry is mishandled, the future of international security and prosperity may ride on it
During their joint news conference, Obama and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto touted their work on economic cooperation Likewise, Obama's speech to the Mexican people stressed economic ties suggested that the economy will become the driving force behind future U.S.-Mexico relations over the past six years, the U.S. has embarked on a strategic partnership with Mexico that has focused on drug-related violence. This partnership has meant closer U.S.-Mexican cooperation on several fronts, including , U.S. training of Mexican security forces

During the debate over the tax cut, Democrats raised concerns that an estimated $1.5 trillion would be added to the national debt. If only they showed the same concern for the $82 trillion behemoth that is Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid Nudging taxes up and down will do little to stop what really ails the federal government As Congressional Budget Office projections show, the government has a growing spending problem Much of this new spending comes from the three entitlement programs With baby boomers retiring in vast numbers, the number of beneficiaries for these programs rises sharply. The CBO calculated that the annual deficit will increase from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2017 to 9.8 percent in 2047, optimistically assuming a recession will never happen in this period — which usually leads to a collapse in tax revenue. unsustainable debt situation, with rising interest rates and declining investment” in the country. Entitlement growth is a looming crisis that everyone knows about — yet everyone ignores. the most predictable economic crisis in history” Social Security has a demographical problem. After World War II came the Baby Boom — an explosion in the U.S. fertility rate. The large Baby Boomer generation was followed by the much smaller Generation X, and while the fertility rate rebounded somewhat for us Millennials, it has never returned to the heights of the Baby Boom. Life expectancy is another factor in the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid dilemma. In 1935, life expectancy was 59.9 for males and 63.9 for females. The financial burden at the time did not seem so great. In 2015, life expectancy was 76.3 for males and 81.2 for females. The number of workers who funded the retirees decreased precipitously, from 41.9 workers supporting one retiree in 1945 to 2.9 supporting one in 2010. This sharp decline in workers risks an increase in taxes — unless something is done. This crisis cannot go on they’re going to need to make changes. Swelling deficits are not sustainable Federal health spending and Social Security made up 53 percent of the federal outlays in 2016. By 2027, it is estimated that they will be 59 percent. This places pressure on other programs that conservatives and liberals both care for, like the military and infrastructure. Political leaders on both sides need to get their act together and save the U.S. from fiscal collapse.
Illicit wildlife trafficking refers to “any environment-related crime that involves the illegal trade, smuggling, poaching, capture or collection of endangered species, protected wildlife (including animals and plants that are subject to harvest quotas and regulated by permits), tigers reptiles amphibians primates birds Still others are being driven to extinction due to their perception as “fine cuisine” in certain markets. Most notably, illicit animal-derived goods, such as ivory carvings, animal-skin rugs, and taxidermy mountings are seen as status symbols in many parts of the world, and the existence of a market for “canned hunting” of endangered animals on private game reserves makes it increasingly easy for illicit trafficking syndicates to launder illegally poached hides under the façade of legal hunts
recent literature emphasised the opportunities that environmental management presents for political cooperation in particular the key finding the shared resources frequently stimulate cooperation rather than conflict, shifted focus from conflict to the possibilities of environmental action as a mode of peacemaking at the international level in terms of environmental diplomacy there is considerable evidence of cooperative action on the part of many states many parts of the world suggest that cooperation and diplomatic arrangements can facilitate peaceful responses to the environmental difficulties in contrast to the pessimism of the 1990’s where the focus was on the potential for conflicts
retrenchment and 'Canada First' attitudes, which have intermittently existed in Canada Quebec nationalism and in western populism have reappeared since the end of the cold war but especially in the last few years, born of economic and budgetary concerns and preoccupation with the constitutional issue bolstered by disappointment over failed multilateral actions made worse by behaviour of members of the armed forces tend to straddle the political divide For policy-makers the most immediate effect of the end of the cold war was the removal of the only serious military threat challenging Canadian security
Obama met with leaders from America’s biggest trade partners Latin America is just beginning to tap into a fresh oil and natural-gas bonanza fuel that can be in Texas within days, as opposed to the six weeks it can take to ship oil from Venezuela to Asia The technology of U.S. energy companies is absolutely necessary if Brazil is to recover its vast offshore oil reserves; U.S. industry will also be needed if Argentina and Mexico are to tap their shale-gas reserves Thanks to the oil and gas windfall sweeping the Americas, over the next ten years the United States could possibly eliminate oil imports from the Middle East altogether Already there are inklings in this direction
Sexual abuse is surreptitiously incorporated into one of the most habitual aspects of women's imprisonment, the strip search. the state itself is directly implicated in this routinization of sexual abuse both in permitting such conditions that render women vulnerable to explicit sexual coercion carried out by guards and other prison staff and by incorporating into routine policy such practices as the strip search and body cavity search. at a national gathering of correctional personnel working in women's prisons. Several women seized control of the stage and dramatized a strip search. , the gathering was so repulsed by this enactment of a practice that occurs routinely in women's prisons everywhere that many of the participants felt compelled to disassociate themselves from such practices Some of the guards simply cried upon watching representations of their own actions outside the prison context. "without the uniform, without the power of the state, (the strip search would be sexual assault the call to abolish the prison as the dominant form of punishment cannot ignore the extent to which the institution of the prison has stockpiled ideas and practices that are hopefully approaching obsolescence in the larger society, but that retain all their ghastly vitality behind prison walls. The destructive combination of racism and misogyny retains all its awful consequences within women's prisons. The relatively uncontested presence of sexual abuse in women's prisons is one of many such examples.
armed clash in the South China Sea and could potentially prompt the United States to use force U.S. military operations within China's EEZ  provokes an armed Chinese response. China routinely intercepts U.S. reconnaissance flights conducted in its EEZ and periodically does so in aggressive ways A comparable maritime incident could be triggered by Chinese vessels harassing a U.S. Navy surveillance ship operating in its EEZ, such as occurred in the 2009 incidents involving the USNS Impeccable and the USNS Victorious. . A miscalculation or misunderstanding could then result in a deadly exchange of fire, leading to further military escalation and precipitating a major political crisis. Rising U.S.-China mistrust and intensifying bilateral strategic competition would likely make managing such a crisis more difficult.
Establish conflict tripwires The Departments of State and Defense should establish a set of “tripwires” associated with the onset or escalation of political violence, conflict, and mass atrocity crimes, along with an associated set of risk-mitigation measures and policy reviews for major arms sales at each stage of the sales process, including past sales At the same time, the Departments should proactively consult civil society to identify the countries that merit additional risk mitigation measures or customized approaches, based on risk. Strengthen the standard terms and conditions and DCS licensing conditions for high-risk items The Director of DSCA (DoD) and the Assistant Secretary for Political Military Affairs (State) should issue joint guidance mandating that the standard terms and conditions for all sales require the purchasing country to comply with IHL and international human rights law, while also strengthening consequences for violating end-use agreements. DSCA should also work with Congress to clarify the definition of legitimate use under the “internal security” and “self-defense” clauses of the Arms Export Control Act, and reiterate that appropriate use under these clauses requires adherence to international law Expand the unit designation requirement and Leahy vetting to FMS cases. At present, DSCA Policy 16-32 requires the unit designation for any unit that will receive equipment or services under the FMF program, enabling the application of Leahy vetting to those units Supplement Country Team Assessments (CTA) with annual interagency arms sales risk assessments for certain FMS recipient countries. Conducting objective risk assessments as a standard operating procedure would both mitigate the potential for biased analysis during individual sales and improve the efficiency of CTAs by providing an agreed-upon body of analysis for the country in question. Adopt a more robust assessment framework for FMS pre-case development To improve the process of evaluating and shaping partner requirements, DSCA should adapt its evaluation of purchasing country needs to include doctrine, operations, training, and policy, similar to the US military’s aforementioned DOTMLPF-P107 framework. Evaluations could be conducted annually or even biannually Institute formal processes for approvals and dissent Letters of Agreement and other formal records approving major sales (as a function of monetary or political value) should be formally approved and signed by the Director of DSCA or the Assistant Secretary for Political Military Affairs. US officials or offices that have well-grounded concerns about a sale or a denial should be empowered to document their positions, and differences of policy views should be adjudicated through a formal, documented escalation process Dissenting views should be fairly represented in notifications to Congress. Require end-use monitoring programs to assess use especially in conflict, and explicitly link end-use monitoring results to future sales. The US government should ensure that it has the access it needs to maintain visibility into the ways in which the major weapons systems it sells are used, especially during conflict. Provide more insight and education to Congress and staff DoD should work with relevant Congressional committees and staff earlier in the process to identify options for minimizing harm to civilians through training and other due diligence measures for the sale of FMS-only items. Make the arms transfer process more transparent to non-governmental stakeholders DoD security cooperation officers should be required to have higher-level certification through DSCA’s Defense Institute of Security Cooperation Studies Clarify tradeoffs in appropriately relative terms: When discussing the tradeoffs involved with risk mitigation and controls on arms sales, external groups, and the US government itself, should clarify the true value represented by any one transaction, or even buyer, as a proportion of total US arms exports. Russia and China may present a competitive challenge in the arms sales market, but strengthening the terms of any one sale will not compromise a distinct American advantage in the global market, and could strengthen it in the long term. Engage industry and civil society in a dialogue focused on reducing risk in US arms sales: Arms manufacturers can benefit from sensible and uniform measures that reduce the risk that their products will result in unlawful acts or other unintended consequences State and DOD should engage industry in a dialogue, involving civil society, to justify risk-mitigation controls and to find innovative ways that industry can be part of the solution to civilian harm.
Berlant is right to be skeptical that a reading of a single novel could be solely responsible for producing such radical changes in individuals. sympathetic reading experiences can play an important role in a larger chain of events alongside other moments of critical thinking and encounters with alternative viewpoints that might shift  perspective Reading can clearly alter one’s sense of reality I don’t know if it is heightened awareness but it seems like there is so much more in the news about racism reading, especially when combined with communal reflection and discussion, provides motivation for taking individual or collective action Several whites in the on-line and televised discussions were putting their anti-racist feelings to work in the public sphere experiences of empathy in cultural space help to sustain and fortify their ongoing political commitments While Berlant doubts that emotional shifts in the private sphere ever get converted into a larger politics of change Lawrence Grossberg argues persuasively that ‘affective relations are the condition of possibility for the optimism, invigoration, and passion which are necessary for any struggle to change the world’ While the experience of sympathy may produce merely self-satisfied feelings of benevolence that substitute for committed action the larger impediment to radical change is not sympathy itself, but conditions that weaken its effectivity such as wide-spread public skepticism that protest can actually accomplish social change I see affective culture as an underappreciated resource in combating the disenchantment that threatens to nullify political resistance in the United States I have highlighted the political importance of empathetic reading in fostering self-transformation and a radical interrogation of white privilege In this particular deployment of empathy, such moments of radical understanding could be seen as an incipient form of political action, rather than its antithesis This form of self-transformation operates on a continuum with largerscale political actions in both ‘private’ and ‘public’ settings Instead of equating the political only with the arena of elections, protest movements, and collective organizing, scholars need to consider the importance of local, interpersonal encounters in effecting social change Is her anti-racist action any less political because it takes place within the ‘private sphere’ such local and personal examples of taking a moral stand do work to undermine racism and are probably necessary stepping stones for individuals to move towards more public-oriented anti-racist acts that require greater risk The power of culture in fostering personal self-transformation should not be undervalued their solicitation of sympathy is in fact central to their cultural power emotive genres are politically powerful because they provoke identification, belonging and investment, providing audiences with ‘mattering maps’ which reveal ‘the places at which people can anchor themselves into the world, the locations of the things that matter’ selections do not provide solutions to social problems concerning race and gender they do offer intense emotional engagement that is an essential ingredient of political engagement. Although sympathy has often worked to legitimate the status quo affective reading experiences can also disrupt ideologies of racial hierarchy Conspicuously absent from most analyses are reading experiences such as I have spotlighted here, in which white women’s empathetic encounters with characters led to an increased politicization and desire to combat racism in public forums these testimonies of suffering produce more radical reading effects when empathetic connections are accompanied by critical reflection, when thought and feeling combine to result in a critique of racism and a deeper respect for cultural difference While Oprah’s utopian claims about the power of individual texts to change the world may seem naively optimistic In this academic climate of suspicion toward a politics rooted in affect, critics need to consider that such cross-racial empathetic identifications in the private sphere could play a crucial role in galvanizing support for anti-racist public policy in America.
Pauline Christianity extends the central demands of Judaism to all mankind. On the contrary, guilt is intensified, the call for inner examination and confession, as opposed to external action, is sharpened, and man is made to feel even more profoundly his radical inadequacy. In addition, the New Testament provokes more vivid and immediate hopes for "the next world," and thus incites a stronger denial of the world. What Christians are exhorted to is the imitation of the asceticism and private charity of Jesus: on the one hand, active compassion for the weak, the suffering, and the untalented; on the other hand, condemnation of the strong, the successful, and the gifted insofar as they do not exhibit humility and do not devote themselves to the service of their inferiors The effect is to reduce their sense of earthly social responsibility to "love of the neighbor," a rather tepid, indiscriminating, pitying, herd mentality. After a protracted struggle with the "Stoic enlightenment" Christianity finally succeeded in bending the tradition of Platonic philosophy, including Aristotelianism and the Stoics, into its service. The common ground shared by Christianity and Platonism certainly helps explain the intellectual victory of Christianity, and frequently Nietzsche speaks as if this, together with Christian seizure of political and social power within the various "peoples," suffices as an explanation of how Christianity transformed the philosophic tradition into a theological tradition. Christianity dares the skeptical rational is to attempt a kind of self-overcoming unknown previously: "The faith which original Christianity demanded, and not infrequently attained, . . . This faith is not that . . . with which, say, a Luther or a Cromwell, or some other northern barbarian of the spirit, clung to his god and to Christianity. It is much closer to the faith of a Pascal, which resembles in a gruesome way a continual suicide of reason . . ." Christianity appealed to the philosopher's will to dramatic self-transformation or self-cruelty: Nietzsche understands philosophy to be, not the quest for truth for its own sake, but an exquisitely refined expression of the urge to reshape the world and oneself, "the most spiritual will to power" hence "The seeker after knowledge . . . acts as an artist and transfigurer of cruelty; indeed, any insistence on profundity and thoroughness is a violation, a desire to hurt the basic will of the spirit" no other type seems to have interested men, even philosophers, more" why did they bow? They divined in him - and as it were behind the question mark of his fragile and miserable appearance - the superior force which wanted to test itself in such a conquest; the strength of the will in which they recognized and wished to honor their own strength and joy in mastery: they honored something in themselves, when they honored the saint" In the hands of scientifically trained theologians the Judeo-Christian insistence on probity takes on a new dimension of penetrating cruelty, and begins to scale new heights of meticulous psychological dissection and self-awareness. By inducing philosophy to direct reason's critical gaze upon reason itself, and its possible roots in "sin," Christianity compels philosophy to begin to rediscover the dubiousness of reason's claim to be the voice of objectivity. Thus the advent of Christian theology signals from afar the beginning of the end of Western man's belief in Plato's illusion of the "pure mind." Granted, the Christian faith does not deny the existence of the "pure mind"; it rather removes that mind to another world and postpones our participation in it to a future life The culminating stages in this historical development are dominated by modern philosophy. He immediately adds, however, that while this struggle has been "antiChristian" it has been "by no means antireligious." "It seems to me that the religious instinct is indeed in the process of growing powerfully - but the theistic satisfaction it refuses with deep suspicion" The atheism of modern philosophy has a spirit altogether different from, say, the cool skepticism of Epicureanism: not only is it animated by a faith in the value of unpleasant truth but, what is more, it has its source in an advanced version of the "religious cruelty" which in its postChristian manifestation finally demands the "sacrifice" of "whatever is comforting" in our illusions about ourselves. It is this originally Christian conscience, turning upon itself, that gradually forces modern man to eye with suspicion the objects as well as the motives behind every "faith" until he arrives at the point where the awareness dawns that all conceptions of good and evil, god, and order are the creations of his own changing human subjectivity: "it is in one particular interpretation, the Christian-moral one, that nihilism is rooted. The end of Christianity - at the hands of its own morality which turns against the Christian God even we knowers of today, we godless ones and antimetaphysicians, still take our fire from the flame that a centuries old faith has kindled: that Christian faith, that was also Plato's faith . ."
This week saw NGL prices trade down—a negative short-term indicator falling from the highs reached in February From a longer-term perspective, many producers still find current price levels economic enough to continue to target and drill for NGLs, but they’ve suffered from NGL prices coming off highs (~$50– $60 per barrel through much of 2011 versus ~$39 per barrel now)

Without ever-rising energy prices or domestic credit, the Russian economy appears to have hit protracted slow growth brought on by the government’s complete lack of interest of supply-side reforms that would increase domestic investment and productivity Russia has suffered for years from a dearth of private investment that could diversify its economy and cushion it against commodity-price fluctuations Russia’s international sales of goods and services last year only barely edged out Belgium’s Russia is not attracting foreign capital And capital continues flowing out of Russia The energy sector is once again largely in state hands Privatization plans continue to be delayed or scaled down meaning that Russia’s most lucrative state-owned assets are unavailable to foreign investors all of these factors have made Russia more energy dependent The fiscal break-even price of oil needed to balance the Russian budget was $34 in 2007. Today it is $117 Russia gets about 70 percent of its export revenue from oil and gas, so even a modest drop would be a significant blow for the authorities and would force it to tap into its reserve fund While Russia has one of the largest stashes of foreign exchange and gold reserves in the world because its budget is so dependent upon energy exports to the West, these formidable reserves could quickly dissipate if oil fell to $80 a barrel
Biologically diverse ecosystems are characterized by a large number of specialist species, filling narrow ecological niches. These ecosystems inherently are more stable than less diverse systems By causing widespread extinctions, humans have artificially simplified many ecosystems. As biologic simplicity increases, so does the risk of ecosystem failure each new animal or plant extinction, with all its dimly perceived and intertwined affects, could cause total ecosystem collapse and human extinction. Each new extinction increases the risk of disaster. Like a mechanic removing, one by one, the rivets from an aircraft's wings, 80 mankind may be edging closer to the abyss.
Apple and Google, both have recently introduced encryption features that would make it impossible for them to unlock a user’s smartphone it means that law enforcement agencies will not be able to spy on their phones Congress does not have FBI Director James Comey’s back members of Congress have tweeted that they doubt such a law would have a chance of being passed. According to republican Darrell Issa, “The FBI and Justice Department must be more accountable – tough sell for them to now ask the American people for more surveillance power.” Democrat Zoe Lofgren added that Comey’s proposal would have a “zero chance” of being passed, with Senator Ron Wyden stating that he did not believe more than a handful of lawmakers would actually get behind such a legislation it looks like users can rest assured that their privacy is still protected.
Both regard manufacturing as precious beyond words, and both think the federal government should be making special efforts to promote it. Obama favors an array of tax breaks to induce manufacturers to keep jobs in the United States, and Santorum wants to completely scrap the corporate income tax on companies in this particular sector. " But if nostalgia were a sound guide to economic policy, we should be building Studebakers and rotary telephones. Neither Santorum nor Obama seems to grasp the realities of manufacturing in 21st-century America. The first is that it's not declining in the ways that matter. Compared with 1990, the total value of U.S. manufacturing output, adjusted for inflation, was up by 75 percent in 2010 — despite a drop caused by the Great Recession The decline in the number of manufacturing jobs is taken as evidence that the sector is sick or uncompetitive or the victim of unfair trade practices. In reality, the change indicates sound health. Our manufacturing workers have become so much more productive that they can churn out more goods with a far smaller workforce. Manufacturing accounts for a shrinking slice of the total economy mainly because as we grow wealthier, we spend a smaller portion of our income on physical products, like cars and appliances, and a bigger one on services, from health care to cellphone contracts to restaurant meals. They didn't insist we keep our typewriters when personal computers came along.
NAFTA included an array of new investment privileges that were unprecedented in scope and power empowering corporations to skirt domestic laws and courts by directly challenging governments’ public interest policies before tribunals The tribunals are comprised of three private sector attorneys who rotate between serving as “judges” and bringing cases for corporations against governments This process is called “investor-state” enforcement. Only commercial interests have standing to challenge government policy, not unions or consumer groups Despite being embedded in a “trade” agreement, NAFTA’s sweeping investor privileges have nothing to do with the flow of goods across borders. Ostensibly, this investor-state regime was intended to provide foreign investors a venue to obtain compensation when their factory or land was expropriated by a government that did not have a reliable domestic court system the actual NAFTA provisions expand far beyond that reasonable safeguard
The Myth of Institutionalized Values is grounded in the belief that process inevitably produces something of value and, therefore, production necessarily produces demand. School teaches us that instruction produces learning The existence of schools produces the demand for schooling all our activities tend to take the shape of client relationships to other specialized institutions the self-taught man or woman has been discredited, all nonprofessional activity is rendered suspect In school we are taught that valuable learning is the result of attendance that the value of learning increases with the amount of input; and, finally, that this value can be measured and documented by grades and certificates. In fact, learning is the human activity which least needs manipulation by others Most learning is not the result of instruction. It is rather the result of unhampered participation in a meaningful setting Once young people have allowed their imaginations to be formed by curricular instruction, they are conditioned to institutional planning of every sort. "Instruction" smothers the horizon of their imaginations They cannot be betrayed, but only short-changed, because they have been taught to substitute expectations for hope. They will no longer be surprised, for good or ill, by other people, because they have been taught what to expect from every other person who has been taught as they were This transfer of responsibility from self to institution guarantees social regression especially once it has been accepted as an obligation So rebels against Alma Mater often "make it" into her faculty instead of growing into the courage to infect others with their personal teaching and to assume responsibility for the results of a new Oedipus story-Oedipus the Teacher, who "makes" his mother in order to engender children with her.
