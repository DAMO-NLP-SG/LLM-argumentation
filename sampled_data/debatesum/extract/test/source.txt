Access to Latin American Markets. Latin American markets are becoming increasingly valuable for Chinese companies because they allow the PRC to expand and diversify its export base at a time when economic growth is slowing in traditional markets such as the United States and Europe. The region has also proven an effective market for Chinese efforts to sell more sophisticated, higher value added products in sectors seen as strategic, such as automobiles, appliances, computers and telecommunication equipment, and aircraft. In expanding access for its products through free trade accords with countries such as Chile, Peru, and Costa Rica, and penetrating markets in Latin American countries with existing manufacturing sectors such as Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina, the PRC has often had to overcome resistance by organized and often politically well-connected established interests in those nations. In doing so, the hopes of access to Chinese markets and investments among key groups of businesspeople and government officials in those nations have played a key role in the political will to overcome the resistance. In Venezuela, it was said that the prior Chinese ambassador to Venezuela, Zheng Tuo, was one of the few people in the country who could call President Chávez on the telephone and get an instant response if an issue arose regarding a Chinese company.¶ Protection of Chinese Investments in and Trade Flows from the Region. At times, China has applied more explicit pressures to induce Latin America to keep its markets open to Chinese goods. It has specifically protested measures by the Argentine and Mexican governments that it has seen as protectionist: and, in the case of Argentina, as informal retaliation, China began enforcing a longstanding phytosanitary regulation, causing almost $2 billion in lost soy exports and other damages for Argentina.14
(CNN)As we get closer to November, I gain confidence that an electoral "wave" will develop the likes of 1946, 1994, 2006 and 2010. Unlike the elections in those years, however, I'm not sure a wave will necessarily mean the minority party will wrestle away control of the House. How is this possible? It gets back to a question the New York Times' Nate Cohn and the Cook Political Report's Amy Walter asked: what is a wave? I'd argue a wave doesn't just need to be measured by seats won. It can be measured by votes won. It's on this score that Democrats are in a very strong position historically speaking. In an average of live interview polls conducted over the last month, Democrats (the minority party) held a 7.5-percentage point lead on the generic congressional ballot. No minority party since World War II has won the national House vote in a midterm election by more than the 8.5 percentage points Republicans won it by in 1946. The next highest was the eight-point margin Democrats took the national House vote by in 2006. The current polling for the upcoming election is between 2006 and the seven-point margin the minority Republicans won it by in 1994 and 2010. That is, Democrats are doing really well for a minority party. The problem for Democrats isn't lack of popular support. It's how that support gets translated into seats. A 7.5-point win in the national House vote puts Democrats right in the area of where they need to be for a net gain of 23 seats to win a majority of seats. The level of disparity between seats and votes won is far from exact, though it illustrates a rather important point that I've spoken about at length. It's not unusual historically speaking for the minority party to need more than a majority of votes (cast for the two major parties) to win a majority of seats. That's because incumbents tend to outperform the national environment, and the majority party usually has more incumbents running. What is unusual about 2018 is how great the disparity is between votes and seats is likely to be because of geographic sorting and gerrymandering. Usually, the minority party would need to win the House popular vote by a few points to win control, not seven. It's this historic difference that makes it difficult, in my mind, to judge a wave on the sole basis of seats won and lost. Now obviously, in terms of control of the government, it's seats that matter. It's also arguable that seats should be included in anyone's definition of a wave. It just strikes me as unreasonable to expect that Democrats to win a net gain of much more than 23 seats given the vote/seat disparity and that no minority party in a midterm in the modern era has done better than an 8.5-point popular vote win. If Democrats are able to do that, it would be extraordinary.
But if the project of overcoming speciesism can be pursued with some expectation of success, this is not the case with the overcoming of anthropocentrism. What makes anthropocentrism unavoidable is a limitation of a quite different sort, one which cannot be overcome even in principle because it involves a non-contingent limitation on moral thinking as such. While overcoming speciesism involves a commitment to the pursuit of knowledge of relevant similarities and differences between humans and other species, the criteria of relevance will always have an ineliminable element of anthropocentrism about them. Speciesism is the arbitrary refusal to extend moral consideration to relevantly similar cases; the ineliminable element of anthropocentrism is marked by the impossibility of giving meaningful moral consideration to cases which bear no similarity to any aspect of human cases. The emphasis is on the ‘meaningful’ here: for in the abstract one could of course declare that some feature of the nonhuman world was morally valuable, despite meeting no determinate criterion of value already recognised by any human, but because the new value is completely unrelated to any existing value it will remain radically indeterminate as a guide to action. If the ultimate point of an ethic is to yield a determinate guide to human action, then, the human reference is ineliminable even when extending moral concern to nonhumans. So my argument is that one cannot know if any judgement is speciesist if one has no benchmark against which to test arbitrariness; and, more specifically, if we are concerned to avoid speciesism of humans then one must have standards of comparison between them and others. Thus features of humans remain the benchmark. As long as the valuer is a human, the very selection of criteria of value will be limited by this fact. It is this fact which precludes the possibility of a radically nonanthropocentric value scheme, if by that is meant the adoption of a set of values which are supposed to be completely unrelated to any existing human values. Any attempt to construct a radically non-anthropocentric value scheme is liable not only to be arbitrary – because founded on no certain knowledge – but also to be more insidiously anthropocentric in projecting certain values, which as a matter of fact are selected by a human, onto nonhuman beings without certain warrant for doing so. This, of course, is the error of anthropomorphism, and will inevitably, I believe, be committed in any attempt to expunge anthropocentrism altogether. But is admitting this unavoidable element of anthropocentrism not tantamount to admitting the unavoidability of human chauvinism? My claim is that it isnot. What is unavoidable is that human valuers make use of anthropocentric benchmarks; yet in doing so, they may find that in all consistency they must, for instance, give priority to vital nonhuman interests over more trivial human interests. For the human chauvinist, by contrast, interests of humans must always take precedence over the interests of nonhumans. Human chauvinism does not take human values as a benchmark of comparison, since it admits no comparison between humans and nonhumans. Human chauvinism ultimately values humansbecause they are humans. While the human chauvinist may officially claim there are criteria which provide reasons for preferring humans – such as that they have language, rationality, sociality etc. – no amount of evidence that other beings fulfil these criteria would satisfy them that they should be afforded a similar moral concern. The bottom line for the human chauvinist is that being human is a necessary and sufficient condition of moral concern. What I am pointing out as the ineliminable element of anthropocentrism is an asymmetry between humans and other species which is not the product of chauvinist prejudice. To sum up, then, what is unavoidable about anthropocentrism is precisely what makes ethics possible at all. It is a basic feature of the logic of obligation: if an ethic is a guide to action; and if a particular ethic requires an agent to make others’ ends her ends, then they become just that – the agent’s ends. This is a noncontingent but substantive limitation on any attempt to construct a completely nonanthropocentric ethic. Values are always the values of the valuer:3 so as long as the class of valuers includes human beings, human values are ineliminable. Having argued that this is unavoidable, I also want to argue that it is no bad thing.
However, historically/epochally defined non-integrability, no matter how important for the future, cannot guarantee success on its own. Switching the allegiance of disappointed socialists from the working class to so-called ‘new social movements’ (praised now in opposition to, and by discarding altogether the emancipatory potential of, labour) must be considered, therefore, far too premature and naive. Single issue movements, even if they fight for non-integrable causes, can be picked off and marginalized one by one, because they cannot lay claim to representing a coherent and comprehensive alternative to the given order as a mode of social metabolic control and system of societal reproduction. This is what makes focusing on the socialist emancipatory potential of labour more important today than ever before. For labour is not only non-integrable (in contrast to some historically specific political manifestations of labour, like reformist social democracy, which may be rightly characterized as integrable and indeed in the last few decades also completely integrated), but — precisely as the only feasible structural alternative to capital — can provide the comprehensive strategic framework within which all ‘single issue’ emancipatory movements can successfully make their common cause for the survival of humanity.
The ban – a revision of an earlier version introduced without warning in February – was set to go into effect March 16, making the 90-day mark June 14. Groups that oppose the ban say that rendered the ban moot: If the travel restrictions really were designed to allow authorities time to review screening procedures, they contend, then it must not be needed after that point.¶ The Trump administration, however, maintained that a lower court's decision blocking the ban from going into effect also stopped authorities from reviewing vetting procedures in the six designated countries. In the administration's view, the 90-day period hadn't even begun.¶ This month, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld the injunction but narrowed it, explicitly stating that DHS could begin working with the six listed countries to review their security procedures. That would mean that the 90-day period would still elapse before oral arguments in October.¶ It's a development that "may moot out most of the current controversy," says David Martin, professor emeritus at the University of Virginia School of Law, although there still may be challenges to another part of the executive order that allows DHS to make certain country-by-country determinations.¶ The 120-day suspension of the refugee program, meanwhile, would still be in effect, but it would be due to end by the end of the month not long after oral arguments.¶ DHS declined to comment on the question of whether the ban would be moot, instead deferring to a statement it issued a few hours after the ruling.¶ "The granting of a partial stay of the circuit injunctions with regard to many aliens abroad restores to the Executive Branch crucial and long-held constitutional authority to defend our national borders," the statement says.¶ In the June 1 briefing, however, spokesman Lapan made clear that, regardless of when the bans are set to lapse, there's nothing stopping the administration from renewing or extending them – and that doing so may, in fact, be likely.¶ "It wasn't necessarily that after that period, it might not be extended if we still weren't satisfied that we had an appropriate amount of information," Lapan said at the time. "The idea was that for at least that 90-day period, we would stop individuals that would potentially pose a threat to the United States, because they were coming from countries, again, that would cause concern and didn't have the capability to provide information that would help us understand who those individuals are. So that 90-day period was meant to reduce the threat of people form those countries coming into the United States as we evaluated."¶ He added: "Can those countries, given those conditions, ever get to that point? Unknowable."
Federalism and the Purposes (and Dangers) of Government A "government" is usually defined as the institution that holds a monopoly of legitimate coercive force within a defined territory. Such an agency of human power offers great potential advantages to its citizens, and great dangers too. Those who prefer a federal system of governance (in contrast to a unitary government) generally argue that this plan reduces the dangers while increasing the benefits. Thus a federal system may be helpful in encouraging and preserving individual liberty, since citizens who feel aggrieved can appeal to more than one "final" authority, and they may also be able to move to a different state or province. Federalism may also provide a route to community autonomy, a value emphasized by groups of native peoples in the US and Canada, by the leaders of francophone Québec, by Sri Lankan dissidents, and elsewhere; and thereby it may help a strife-ridden nation become a peaceful society. Moreover, a federal system may encourage active involvement by citizens, thus nourishing participatory democracy. Federalism also encourages each state or province to devise its own strategies for economic development -- strategies which may be more effective (because they are based on a closer understanding of local culture, resources and skills), and which, through the variety of different strategies tried by different states and provinces, may produce innovative programs whose success can then be emulated by other regions & nations. A federal system may have a similar advantage in other fields -- for example in trying distinctive strategies to undertake stem-cell research, to obtain prescription drugs, to treat those who are dying, and generally in the field of social services. As Justice Kennedy suggests in the quotation above (he is borrowing from Woodrow Wilson and Justice Brandeis decades earlier), states may serve as important "laboratories for experimentation".
China bashing has become as much a part of the modern American political tradition as criticizing foreign producers of oil. The American electorate has regrettably become accustomed to the predictable torrent of anti-Chinese rhetoric from politicians of a variety of political persuasions – currently manifested by the incendiary rhetoric of Donald Trump, who is playing upon the fears and disillusionment largely of blue collar workers who do not understand that China is not the source of their problems, but rather America’s failure to remain competitive in the global economic landscape. They also do not realize that China will soon reassume the mantle of the world’s largest economy – a title which it held until just before the start of the Industrial Revolution. Until that time China was the leading steel producer, textile manufacturer, and trading nation — from the Chinese perspective, it is simply about to resume the status which it previously held. Some Americans may bristle at the notion that capitalism has helped China come to dominate the global economy, but the truth is, China was practicing capitalism a long time before America even became a nation. China is not above criticism, and some American politicians do raise some valid points in criticizing China, such as that the government controls large parts of the Chinese economy through state-owned enterprises, which distorts the domestic market and gives some Chinese companies unfair competitive advantages. But what they then fail to say is that China must also compete in the global marketplace, and that it pays a price for supporting companies that should otherwise fail as a result of being poorly run, inefficient, or bloated. If the U.S. does not like the way China does business, it is of course free to do business somewhere else, but that would be a really bad idea for America. U.S. exports to China totaled $120 billion in 2014, making it the third-largest export market for U.S. goods (behind Canada and Mexico). Between 2005 and 2014, U.S. exports to China increased 198% – greater than growth to any of the other top ten U.S. export markets. The truth is, there is no country in the world more important to the growth of U.S. exports than China. China’s rapidly growing middle class is the single most important factor accounting for the success of President Obama’s National Export Initiative. The U.S. not only needs to tap China’s vast foreign currency reserves ($3.3 trillion – almost 28 times that of the U.S., at $119 billion) in order to finance its trade deficit and fiscal deficit, it also needs access to China’s vast market in order to sustain its economic recovery and continue to create much needed jobs for American workers. When was the last time you heard a U.S. politician admit that? Six of the top ten states that lead in exports to China (California, Illinois, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington) set records in 2014 for exports and creating export-related jobs. Just ask any Chamber of Commerce in these states what their view of China is and you will find they are highly complimentary of the contribution China is making to the creation of jobs in their states. Since 2000, China has invested tens of billions of dollars in the U.S, generating tens of thousands of jobs. In 2015, 18% of Chinese exports went to the U.S., which remains a very important partner for the growth of the Chinese economy. Chinese leaders realize this, and do not reciprocate in bashing the U.S. for allegedly taking away Chinese jobs by doing business together. Campaign rhetoric aside, both countries know that they need each other. As the largest holder of U.S. Treasury Bills, China needs and wants the U.S. to succeed economically. Rather than bashing China, U.S. politicians would be well advised to forge an even stronger relationship with it. Instead of following predictable and boring scripts, U.S. politicians should turn the page on Cold War-esque rhetoric and find ways to join hands with China so as to mutually benefit from each other’s comparative advantages. It is also worth noting that China bashing actually makes little sense in terms of getting U.S. presidential candidates elected. The top five U.S. states exporting to China by dollar volume in 2014 (Washington, California, Texas, Illinois and South Carolina) between them account for nearly 50% of the votes needed to win the U.S. presidency in the Electoral College (270 votes are required, and 134 votes are accounted for by just these 5 states). Bashing China is actually less likely to get a candidate elected, because the workers in these states have the most to lose economically by curtailing America’s economic relationship with China, and they know it. The fact is, a continued economic recovery in the U.S. cannot be achieved by isolating China. Considering what can be achieved together, and what both countries stand to lose if they are pitted against each other, forming a Sino-American strategic alliance is critical to the future economic viability of both nations. American politicians, and the American people, would be much better off recognizing this, rather than succumbing to demagoguery and incendiary rhetoric aimed at creating divisiveness between China and the U.S.
Long-Term Budgetary Effects of Expanded Leasing Whether future Administrations will make areas in the Atlantic, Pacific, or eastern Gulf of Mexico available for oil and gas leasing by 2023 is not known, but CBO expects that such leasing will occur over time without any changes in law. Legislation to require immediate leasing of those areas would accelerate development but probably would not affect the total amount of development in those areas over the next several decades.
U.S. allies and security partners in Asia and the Middle East would use America’s diminished military power and geopolitical influence as justification to pursue their own nuclear options. If Washington were perceived as acquiescing in any way to nuclear breakout by Tokyo or Seoul, then we should expect signatories of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1968 (NPT),25 including some U.S. friends, to cite discriminatory doublestandards and even quit the NPT. Likely candidates in the Middle East would include Saudi Arabia and other Arab Gulf security partners who are already threatened by Iran’s drive to rapid nuclear weaponsmaking capability in violation of the NPT and numerous U.N. Security Council Resolutions. In Asia, candidates would include the region’s many technologically-advanced and technologically-rising nations. Taiwan might be tempted to restart its reversed nuclear bomb-making efforts from the 1970s and 1980s. Australia, birthplace of the SILEX method of laser enrichment that General Electric hopes someday to commercialize,26 may see prudence in developing, at the very least, a latent nuclear weapons-making capability. So might partners like Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam.
Congress passed the Clean Water Act more than four decades ago to safeguard our nation’s major waterways. These rivers and other bodies of water are sources for drinking water and transportation, known as “navigable waters.” In my northern Missouri district, situated between the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, healthy rivers are absolutely essential to the local economy and farm communities. The Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seem to be losing sight of their fundamental mission and instead are more concerned with expanding their own regulatory footprint. Under a newly proposed “Waters of the United States” rule, thousands of small streams, ditches, ponds and other isolated bodies of water, and lands near them, will be subject to federal jurisdiction and all the regulation, permitting and mitigation that entails. The consequences for millions of small businesses, farmers and local governments could be dire. Over the years, the agencies’ regulatory interpretation of CWA jurisdiction has been stretched further and further to include bodies of water that have little or no connection to waters that are used for traditional commerce. This proposed rule was touted as necessary to provide more clarity, but is doing the exact opposite by using vaguely defined terms that may be read to include small ponds, ditches or small streams that run only when there is heavy rain. And this extraordinary regulatory intrusion into the lives of many farmers, ranchers and small-business owners has the likely potential to be economically devastating. Recently, the Small Business Committee, which I chair, held a hearing and heard from small businesses that will be affected by the proposed rule. Alan Parks, an executive with a Memphis, Tenn., stone and gravel company explained the proposed rule’s problems and consequences for small businesses, stating, “The proposed rule has no clear line on what is ‘in’ and what is ‘out,’ making it very difficult for our industry and other businesses to plan new projects and make hiring decisions. If it is determined development of a site will take too long or cost too much in permitting or mitigation, we won’t move forward. That means a whole host of economic activity in a community will not occur — all of this in the name of protecting a ditch or farm pond.” While the proposed rule clearly has significant consequences for small businesses, the agencies failed to assess those impacts. Had the agencies conducted outreach to and solicited input from small businesses, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, they may have identified and fixed some of the problems with the rule before it was proposed. My colleagues and I on the Small Business Committee have called on EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw the proposed rule and examine the real-world consequences of their rule on small businesses before they move forward. Although I appreciate the EPA’s recent decision to extend the comment period, it would be wiser still to withdraw the rule altogether, step back and thoroughly weigh the costs and economic consequences for small businesses.
The treatment of these two men demonstrates the continuing use of authoritarian and arbitrary punishment of alleged sources of social unrest. The use of the courts to punish activists is part of the broader campaign by the party-state to tighten control over society. Its focus on the media is clear: China was ranked 176th out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders’ 2015 index of worldwide press freedom. Censorship of the internet has increased: earlier this year of a number of “virtual private networks” (VPNs), which are used to bypass Internet filtering and censorship, were blocked. And in August, nearly 200 people were punished for posting rumors on the Web that “misled society and the public, generated and spread fearful sentiment, and even used the opportunity to maliciously concoct rumors to attack [Communist] Party and national leaders.” The anxiety over control may provide the answer to a question: Why has handling the activists’ cases taken so long? One possible reason is that the party became preoccupied with the threatened collapse of the stock market and other financial problems, and the leadership did not want to risk raising social discontent in a society already beset with anxiety and doubts about prevailing policies. Whatever the cause, the handling of these cases demonstrates China’s use of the courts for purely political purposes.
Sassen (1998) argued that a new ‘de facto transnationalization of immigration policy,’ (i.e., a global policy regime) has emerged because supranational forces (e.g., NAFTA, or the European Union) shape immigration policy. I argue that a transnationalization of immigration policy may also derive from a convergence of state policies with common goals. I argue also that immigration policy has been transnational at least since the seventeenth century where it concerns blacks, and is evident even in periods when some of these nations had no black population (immigrant or native-born) of significant size. Although I echo Sassen’s call to be aware of the global repercussions of inter-national action, together, Western efforts to exclude the phenotypically black amount to the construction of a global blockade to black migration and mobility in a form of transnationalization that significantly predates the forces of which Sassen speaks. I agree that scholars may emphasize singular cases and localized social constructions to the degree that we see the trees (here, the social-constructing of racial categories in local settings), but miss the forest (processes reinforcing transnational racialized and world systematic hierarchies). This article serves to re-insert ‘black’ as relevant category in the discourse on globalized, racialized immigration, and to refigure anti-black racism as a global immigration phenomenon. Despite differences among these nations’ histories, a transnationalization of anti-black sentiment in immigration law and policy in the Anglophone West began during the trade in enslaved Africans and continues today. The sentiment of global anti-blackness is marked throughout with ambivalence. Before and during the world wars, Western nations were ambivalent about the merits of using black labourers, soldiers and seamen in fortifying their economies and polities, yet at no time were they considered persons that merited inclusion in the democratic revolution that was taking place at the time (Feagin 2000). Western nations were unified in their approach to ‘accepting’ the fruits of work and war: black persons should only be temporarily used for their contribution, and once their usefulness was spent, they should return from whence they came. In the post-war period, co-dependency and collaboration in a transnational anti-blackness became more evident, even as we see the beginnings of ‘race-neutral’ laws with more obvious racializing outcomes. Where global anti-blackness operates without the use of overtly racist language, Western nations’ lawmakers can claim to have transcended racism while still managing to maintain racial hierarchies – a macro-level version of the ‘new’ ‘colorblind’ racism (Bonilla-Silva 2001, 2003; Winant 2001). The contradictions of these efforts are pronounced in the most recent period, where a rights discourse, coupled with illiberal law and policy, continue to shape a racialized hierarchy of immigrants that may be seen as a (perhaps unintended but) enormously consequential anchoring of black persons to the bottom of the racial and ‘world systemic’ hierarchies. a
The best starting point for conceptualizing security lies in the real conditions of insecurity suffered by people and collectivities. Look around. What is immediately striking is that some degree of insecurity, as a life-determining condition, is universal. To the extent an individual or group is insecure, to the extent their life choices and changes are taken away; this is because of the resources and energy they need to invest in seeking safety from domineering threats – whether these are the lack of food for one’s children, or organizing to resist a foreign aggressor. The corollary of the relationship between insecurity and a determined life is that a degree of security creates life possibilities. Security might therefore be conceived as synonymous with opening up space in people’s lives. This allows for individual and collective human becoming – the capacity to have some choice about living differently – consistent with the same but different search by others. Two interrelated conclusion follow from this. First, security can be understood as an instrumental value; it frees its possessors to a greater or lesser extent from life-determining constraints and so allows different life possibilities to be explored. Second, security is not synonymous simply with survival. One can survive without being secure (the experience of refugees in long-term camps in war-torn parts of the world, for example). Security is therefore more than mere animal survival (basic animal existence). It is survival-plus, the plus being the possibility to explore human becoming. As an instrumental value, security is sought because it free people(s) to some degree to do other than deal with threats to their human being. The achievement of a level of security–and security is always relative –gives to individuals and groups some time, energy, and scope to choose to be or become, other than merely surviving as human biological organisms. Security is an important dimension of the process by which the human species can reinvent itself beyond the merely biological.
Education Beyond Capital80 The true nature of the struggle over schooling in the United States today is evident in the daily vilifying of teachers and teachers’ unions by the neoliberal school reform movement and the corporate media.81 Speaking to teachers in Chicago, Ravitch (who worked in both the George H. W. Bush and Clinton administrations and was originally a strong supporter of NCLB) declared: Corporate School reform is a fig leaf for the real purpose: getting rid of unions. Corporate school reform calls on legislatures to roll back collective bargaining rights, get rid of unions. But once they’re gone, there is no one to speak for children, for working conditions…. Who applauds when schools are closed? Wall Street hedge funds, Democrats for Education Reform (wolves in sheep’s clothing), Stand for Children [which receives millions of dollars from the Gates Foundation], the Billionaire Boys Club (Gates, Walton, Broad), various Washington, D.C. think tanks, almost all of which are funded by the Gates Foundation, and influence many of the leading editorial boards. It’s a circular corporate reform movement. And I do want to say that whenever we speak of this education reform we label it correctly as corporate reform.82 The new capitalist-driven school reforms principally target teachers and their unions for a reason: teachers, as a rule (although often politically passive), strongly object to both the new corporate schooling being imposed on their students and the Taylorization of their own labor process. Teachers generally view themselves as educational professionals, but are today being rapidly proletarianized. Hence, they are the most powerful potential opposition to the school restructuring plan and the commodification of school children. For this reason, the new testing systems are aimed first and foremost at teachers. They are intended to be assessments, not primarily of the students themselves, but of the degree to which teachers have succumbed to Taylorization—and thus they constitute the main weapon in the attempt to wrest control of the practice of education from teachers. Duncan has on several occasions proclaimed that one of the main achievements of Race to the Top has been forcing states to abandon restrictions on using student-assessment tests to evaluate teachers.83 As Ravitch observed in The Death and Life of the Great American School System: [Teachers’] unions have many critics, including some within their own ranks who complain that their leaders fail to protect teachers against corporate reformers….But the critics most often quoted in the media see unions as the main obstacle to education reform. They fault the unions for their resistance to using test scores to evaluate teachers. They want administrators to have the freedom to fire teachers whose students’ test scores do not improve and replace them with new teachers who might raise those scores. They want to use test scores as the decisive tool of evaluation.84 Here it is useful to return to the basic point—made in the 1970s in Bowles and Gintis’s Schooling in Capitalist America—that there is a rough correspondence in any given historical period between the social relations of production and the social relations of education. Viewed from this general political-economic standpoint, the conditions leading to the neoliberal assault on the schools can be attributed to the current historical period of economic stagnation, financialization, and economic restructuring, characteristic of the age of monopoly-finance capital. The slowdown in economic growth, beginning in the 1970s, weakened the capacity of labor to struggle by purely economic means, while also weakening workers’ political clout, as conservative, corporate forces strengthened their hegemony over the society. The relative growth of financial and information capital, spurred by the stagnation of production, created a new impetus for digital-based Taylorism and tight financial management in the schools. At the same time, inequality, poverty, and unemployment soared, as capital shifted the economic losses to the working class and the poor. When the new burdens resulting from slow growth, increasing inequality, and rising child poverty were coupled with tightened restraints on state spending, the schools went into a rapid downward spiral. Public schools, as the ultimate social safety net for most children and communities, were forced to step in to make up for the collapsing social and economic fabric. With “the revolt of the haves” that developed in this period, the traditional local financing of schools based on property taxes eroded. States and the federal government were forced to take over the financing of the schools, local control was reduced, and a corporate-finance model came to dominate, along with traditional corporate management goals. The failure of the high-stakes testing and accountability to effect improvements, even in terms of their own narrow criteria, led to even more intensified attacks on teachers and teachers’ unions as the source of the problem. The bursting of the financial bubble beginning in 2007 and the Great Recession that followed further undermined schools and teachers’ unions, creating a generalized state of emergency. Although the share of K-12 education in GDP rose slightly, to a seeming high watermark of 4.3 percent, in 2009, this did not reflect a greater overall commitment to education, but rather the relative weakness of the private economy in relation to government spending in the context of the Great Recession. More indicative of the deteriorating trend in education spending in this period is the fact that U.S. elementary and secondary education fell from 22.7 percent of total government spending in 2001, to 21.7 percent in 2005, and to 21.0 percent in 2009—with every indication that its share of total government expenditures is continuing to plummet.85 In this rapidly decaying situation, the attack on teachers and the destruction of their morale can be seen as fatal to the public education system, since teachers generally in capitalist society have sought to promote education (not mere schooling), out of a commitment to children, often in defiance of an alienated system. Teachers have adopted counter-hegemonic practices and upheld by sheer force of commitment, a collapsing school system that, without their often extraordinary efforts would surely have given way. Most teachers surveyed by the National Education Association in its most recent Status of the American Public School Teacher work at least ten non-compensated hours (beyond the standard 40-hour-work week) each week, and supplement classroom budgets/resources with their own purchases, averaging $443 a year.86 Without the strong social commitment of teachers, the overstrained public education system would surely have succumbed to its own contradictions long ago. Most teachers, over the last few decades, have gotten used to being on the frontlines in dealing with the effects of economic crisis and class-race war on schoolchildren. The creation of a program of national assessment, aimed principally at teachers and teachers’ unions, with the goal of privatizing the education system and turning the mass of students into drones for industry has brought public education into the very center of the structural crisis of the system. Many teachers have been fired, while others have fled the dying public schools. Given the effects of worsening socioeconomic conditions on public education, any reference to closing the achievement gap that does not centrally address the wider social problems and their effect on schools represents a cruel hoax. Summarizing the conclusions of decades of educational research in the Teachers College Record in 1995, Jean Anyon observed: It has become increasingly clear that several decades of educational reform have failed to bring substantial improvements to schools in America’s inner cities. Most recent analyses of unsuccessful school reform (and prescriptions for change) have isolated educational, regulatory, or financial aspects of reform from the social context of poverty and race in which inner-city schools are located….The structural basis for failure in inner-city schools is political, economic, and cultural, and must be changed before meaningful school improvement projects can be successfully implemented. Educational reforms cannot compensate for the ravages of society.87 In the past few decades, the response of the nation’s overworked teachers to “the ravages of society” and the accompanying attacks on schools has usually been to use what energy they had on helping their students, while avoiding organized political activity. But this may be changing. Today political resistance around schools from teachers, parents, students, and community members seems to be emerging at long last in the United States—though it is too soon to know what this portends. Already in 2010, Karen Lewis, a high-school chemistry teacher and the leader of the Caucus of Rank-and-File Educators (CORE), won an upset election to become president of the Chicago Teacher’s Union, deposing the two-time, old-guard incumbent. This emanated from a desire on the part of Chicago teachers, in Arne Duncan’s hometown, to fight for their jobs, working conditions, and the future of education for their students. CORE arose as a grassroots rebellion against Duncan’s Chicago “turnaround” legacy of school closings and the charterizing of schools. It therefore represents a turn away from a business union structure, toward a more politicized union.88 In April 2011, in Detroit, students protested to prevent the closing of the award-winning Catherine Ferguson Academy, a public school for pregnant teens and moms that boasts a 100 percent college acceptance rate in a district where one-third of all students do not even graduate. The protests gathered national attention after some of the students and their supporters, engaged in a peaceful sit-in, were arrested. Detroit as a whole is facing massive school closures at the orders of the emergency manager of Detroit Public Schools, Robert Bobb, a 2005 graduate of the Broad Superintendents Academy, who receives an annual salary supplement of $145,000, provided by the Broad and Kellogg foundations. It is not surprising that some have called Bobb’s management strategy “financial martial law”: in April 2011, all 5,466 of Detroit’s public school teachers were given layoff notices.89 The intense class struggle in Wisconsin in 2011, brought on by Governor Scott Walker’s attempt to eliminate public sector unions in that state, may mark a new stage in the conflict between labor-community and capital. In May 2011, as part of the general revolt against Walker’s actions, radical education activist, Bob Peterson, a fifth-grade teacher and a founding editor of Rethinking Schools, was elected president of the 8,000-member Milwaukee Teachers’ Education Association.90 Throughout May 2011, students, parents, and teachers participated in national protests over the gutting of public education. On May 9, 2011, thousands of teachers, students, and supporters commenced a weeklong “State of Emergency” for public education in California. In a May 9 teachers’ protest at the state capitol in Sacramento, California, sixty-five students, teachers, and their supporters were arrested, followed by the arrest of a further twenty-seven on May 12, including the president of the California Teachers Association.91 The protests pointed to a student and teacher (as worker) alliance in this area that is particularly alarming to the powers that be. In his May budget outline, California Governor Jerry Brown responded to these growing protests against the onslaught against the schools, in what may be a major departure, by indicating that he intends to put the brakes on out–of-control state testing. Brown declared: “Teachers are forced to curb their own creativity and engagement with students as they focus on teaching to the test. State and federal administrators continue to centralize teaching authority far from the classroom.” Brown says he intends to “reduce the amount of time devoted to state testing in schools” and to “restore power to school administrators, teachers and parents.” Brown is seeking to suspend funding for the state longitudinal data system for education (designed to integrate existing databases in order to facilitate the retention of long-term student assessment data), and to end all further planning for the accompanying teacher database. He had earlier declared, as California Attorney General, that the real problems affecting “‘struggling low performing schools’” are “deeply rooted in the social and economic conditions of the community.”92 The strategic goal of a resistance movement to public school privatization should not simply be to defend the existing school system—but to make use of this state of emergency to create the basis of a truly revolutionary approach to the education process, based in community schools. This could take place under the motto promoted by the James and Grace Lee Boggs Center in Detroit: Another Education is Possible. As Grace Lee Boggs has written, we need to engage our children in the community-building process, including education, “with the same audacity with which the civil rights movement engaged them in desegregation activities.” Radical education theorist Bill Ayers has called for rebuilding the model of “liberatory education” and freedom schools in defiance of No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top, rearticulating “the ideal that each human being is of infinite value.” This means emphasizing, as radical educators historically have, a process of self-engaged learning—recognizing, in line with Marx and Paulo Freire, that the answer to the question, “Who educates the educator?” is ultimately one of liberation pedagogy, in which the students themselves are the main protagonists.93 We have to understand this as part of a global struggle. The same corporate reforms of schooling are being exported throughout the capitalist world, Brazil, being but one example.94 The stakes are extremely high. In his article, “Why Socialism?” published in the first issue of Monthly Review, in May 1949, Albert Einstein wrote: The crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism. Our whole educational system stems from this evil. An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for a future career. I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are organized by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.95 For Einstein, education and socialism were intimately, dialectically connected. Such a vision of education—related to social transformation and planning—meant that education needed, in his view, to be part of our whole lives, not confined to the realm of schooling. I believe we must prepare ourselves today for a for a long revolution to create, among other things, a new education tied to community, and developing out of peoples’ real needs. Such a “community-centered and person-based” education, situated first in public schools, but extending into the society as a whole, is best achieved by creating the widest possible respect for education, as constituting, at one and the same time, a way of life, a key to human emancipation, and an indispensable basis for the creation of a world of substantive equality.
There is one last feature of Nietzsche’s theoretical speculations on giftgiving warranting some attention. This point, raised by Gary Shapiro,35 invites a consideration of Nietzsche’s philosophy of masks. As Shapiro describes, gift-giving risks undermining the masks . . . that are necessary for our protection. In giving a gift one undertakes the hermeneutical project of discovering what is appropriate to the true character of the recipient. If I fail to interpret him properly, he will feel that some violence or degradation has been done. . . . 36 Nietzsche’s philosophy of masks is of considerable importance, particularly when comparing the congruence between what the intervener gives and what the recipient wants or needs. Indeed, if I fail to recognize, connect with, and respond to the individual on this most fundamental of levels, the receiver of the assistance is certain to feel that an injustice has occurred. This is significant in the context of advocacy where the assigner’s gift must be entirely congruent with the recipient’s desire. A failure to understand this dynamic only furthers the (purported) injustice against which the giver assumes his/her unique role as (mental health) advocate.37
The South American applesnail Pomacea canaliculata (Family Ampullariidae) has¶ been introduced and established within the United States in central Florida, three¶ sites in southern California, and in at least 12 places in southeastern and¶ northern Texas. Most of these populations are not in agricultural areas, though¶ some ecological impact has been observed in Florida. One California introduction¶ discovered in 2001 may be near cultivated lands, but not plant species subject to¶ Pomacea depredation. In Texas, however, populations found in 2000 and 2001¶ are centrally-located in the rice-producing region. The species is now present in¶ rice irrigation canals, natural streams and bayous adjacent to fields, and rice¶ fields themselves. Although egg masses, vast numbers of juveniles, and some¶ adults have been found in rice fields in 2002, no crop damage has been reported¶ to date (August 2002). It is hoped that draining irrigation canals over winter,¶ dewatering fields when not in production, and perhaps use of selected pesticides¶ may be able to restrict population size to tolerable levels. Present P. canaliculata¶ populations also are not in locations where extensive ecological damage would¶ be expected.
Executive Summary on Nuclear War 200 million megaton of explosions will not kill the biosphere. The current nuclear arsenal will not kill all humans and the pattern of nuclear explosions for a nuclear war between the largest nuclear powers will not destroy civilization, let alone kill all people or even half of all people. The greatest risks from a total nuclear war are from fire and starvation and not from the radiation or the blasts. The historic high for megatonnage was reached in 1960 with nearly 20,500 megatons (that’s 20 billion tons, or 40 trillion pounds, of TNT)—the equivalent of about 1,400,000 Hiroshimas. Today the total is about one-tenth the 1960 level, or about 2,000 megatons, or 140,000 Hiroshimas. This is only 6 times more than the peak years for nuclear bomb testing 1961-1962 when 340 megatons were exploded in above ground tests.
Powering Growth¶ Despite the importance of coking coal in steel production in China, it is thermal coal in electricity production that has been the powerhouse of the Chinese coal market.¶ The IEA estimates that in 2008 coal accounted for almost 80% of Chinese electricity production. Hydro makes up much of the remaining 20% of electricity generation in China. While growth rates in renewable energies are high, they are starting from a very low base. According to the IEA, China will add an additional 600GW of new coal-fired power generation by 2035, this exceeds the current coal capacity of the USA, EU and Japan combined. It is this level of consumption and projected growth that makes China key to the future look of the global coal industry.
Restrictions for medical and moral conditions Added to the exclusion list were illiterates, persons of psychopathic inferiority, men as well as women entering for immoral purposes, alcoholics, stowaways, and vagrants. A bill increased the head tax on immigrants, and added people with physical or mental defects or tuberculosis and children unaccompanied by parents to the exclusion list. Japanese immigration became restricted
Ever since Tsai Ing-wen was elected president of Taiwan in 2016, Beijing has signaled its displeasure with her stand-alone attitude. China has been stepping up its campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally, while its military flexes its muscles. Outright conflict, for now, remains unlikely, but the narrow Taiwan Strait is reemerging as one of Asia’s most dangerous potential flash points, experts say. Last month, Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act into law, after unanimous votes in both houses of Congress. Recognizing Taiwan as a “beacon of democracy in Asia,” the act declares that it should be U.S. policy to send officials at all levels to Taiwan and allow high-level Taiwanese officials to visit their counterparts in Washington. While some experts have played down the act as “not legally binding,” Julian Ku, a professor at Hofstra University’s law school, said that underestimates its significance. He called it a “statutory declaration of policy” that the administration has an obligation to observe, even if there are no penalties for failing to do so. Similar policy declarations, such as a 1998 vow to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act, had significant impacts on foreign policy. “Because such declarations reflect the agreement of both houses of Congress and the president, it is hardly surprising that, as the Iraq and Cuba examples should remind us, such statutory declarations of policy often prevail as actual U.S. foreign policy,” he wrote. “We can and should expect the Taiwan Travel Act to shape U.S. Taiwan policy in the near and long term.” After Trump signed the act, China’s government lodged “stern” objections, warning Washington of potentially serious damage to the foundations of their relationship. The nationalist Global Times newspaper recommended striking back by blacklisting from visits to the mainland any U.S. officials who travel to Taipei, and even preparing for a possible “direct military clash” in the Taiwan Strait. The appointment of John Bolton as national security adviser has also raised the stakes. Writing in the Wall Street Journal in January, Bolton said Washington should “play the Taiwan card” against China, even to the point of redeploying some U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Taiwan, or granting Taiwan full diplomatic recognition if Beijing refuses to back down in the South China Sea. Either of those moves would be seen in Beijing as firmly crossing a line. “Taiwan needs the United States’ strong support, but it should be wary that this not tip toward belligerence,” said Margaret Lewis, a professor at Seton Hall Law School currently working in Taiwan. “Especially with so many global flash points that could quickly divert the U.S. government’s attention, a concern is that the U.S. might take an outspoken stance on Taiwan and then suddenly soften its tone, which could leave Taiwan in an even more vulnerable position,” she said. Trump, too, is a wild card. He spoke to Tsai on the phone last year and approved a $1.4 billion arms sales package, but has also talked of Taiwan as a potential bargaining chip in the broader contest with Beijing. He has veered between buddying up to China’s President Xi Jinping and attacking Beijing over trade. The backdrop is a rise in tensions between Taipei and Beijing since the 2016 election of Tsai. Her party sees Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation, and although she has ruled out any declaration of independence from China, she has declined to endorse the idea that there is “one China.”
Third, Congress needs to simplify the process of oversight. Overlapping jurisdiction sows confusion in the executive branch. If there is no Standing Committee on Homeland Security, then DHS officials will spend excessive time testifying in front of multiple committees with oversight and jurisdictional responsibilities. Indeed, this has already been the case. DHS officials have been pulled in different directions, and have not testified in front of the Select Committee with the same focus that they would if it had primary legislative and oversight jurisdiction. Overlapping jurisdiction saps time that DHS officials need to do the important work of implementing DHS’s goals, and denies them the benefit of informed Congressional consultation. It will greatly help and simplify the enormous tasks confronting the Secretary of Homeland Security if he understands clearly the key members of Congress with whom he must consult and work. Congress can make a significant contribution to the implementation of DHS and its policies by simplifying this overlapping committee structure. 4) Set Priorities and Streamline Budgeting Fourth, Congress needs a Committee that can assist DHS in setting priorities and streamlining the budget for homeland security. The primary difficulty of protecting the homeland is setting priorities. There are an infinite number of targets, a wide array of terrorist methods, and a seemingly endless list of areas and entities that demand resources. Congress can help DHS set clear priorities so that the right resources are channeled to the right people at the right time to get the job done. Multiple committees with jurisdiction and oversight are likely to have different – even conflicting – priorities for DHS agencies. This will complicate an already complicated task. Creating a single committee will have the opposite effect, enabling the House to convey clear, focused priorities for homeland security. Just as DHS needs focused priorities, homeland security demands a streamlined budgeting process. A fragmented committee structure lends itself to poorly defined priorities and poorly allocated resources. Consolidating the authorization of expenditures for emergency-responders within a Standing Committee will ensure that appropriations are more suited to the prioritized demands of homeland security. Logic of a Standing Committee Each of these arguments points to the basic logic of creating a Standing Committee on Homeland Security: homeland security is a matter of the utmost seriousness; homeland security is a long-term issue; homeland security demands that government navigate a complex maze of policy choices in the most efficient manner possible.
Comprehensive approaches are urgently needed to make school environments welcoming for LGBT students and staff, and to allow students to learn and socialize with peers without fearing exclusion, humiliation, or violence. Above all: States should repeal outdated and stigmatizing laws that deter and arguably prohibit discussion of LGBT issues in schools, and enact laws protecting students and staff from bullying and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Schools should ensure that policies, curricula, and resources explicitly include LGBT people, and that the school environment is responsive to the specific needs of LGBT youth. Teachers and administrators should work to make existing policies meaningful by enforcing protections and intervening when bullying or discrimination occurs.
LONDON/MOSCOW - A new trade route for energy supplies is opening up north of the Arctic Circle as some of the warmest temperatures on record shrink ice caps that used to lock ships out of the area. This year is likely to rank among the top 10 for the amount of sea ice melting in the Arctic Ocean after heat waves across the Northern Hemisphere this summer. While that is alarming to environmentalists concerned about global warming, ship owners carrying liquefied natural gas and other goods see it as an opportunity. Their cargoes have traversed the region for the first time this year without icebreakers, shaving days off shipping times and unlocking supplies from difficult-to-reach fields in Siberia.  More navigable waters are a boost for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s effort to expand his nation’s reach in the gas market and for energy companies such as Total SA and Novatek PJSC, which are leading Arctic developments. They also help reduce shipping costs for LNG, benefiting buyers and traders of the fuel from PetroChina Co. to Gunvor Group Ltd. “There is a growth trend for volumes transported via the Northern Sea Route this year,” said Sergei Balmasov, head of the Arctic Logistics Information Office, a consultancy in Murmansk, Russia. “The reason is an increase in LNG exports.” While shorter shipping journeys reduce emissions, environmentalists are concerned that more traffic through the Arctic will add to the amount of black carbon—particles of pure carbon — settling in the snow from tanker smokestacks. When that soot darkens the surface of the ice, it speeds up the warming process by absorbing more of the sun’s energy. And with the shipping season through the Arctic starting earlier and ending later, tankers will spend more time in the area and spew more of their pollution onto the ice. Turbulent weather in the area also churns the seas, making it almost impossible to clean up anything that has spilled. The International Maritime Organization is considering rules that will ban burning heavy fuel oil in Arctic waters, extending restrictions already in place in the Antarctic. “It’s a major concern for us because as the ice melts we are seeing more and more shipping,” said Sian Prior, lead adviser for the Clean Arctic Alliance, an environmental group. Scientists are seeing a rapid change in the Arctic. The Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia lost about half its ice coverage during a two-week period in February, while the most northern weather station in Greenland recorded temperatures above freezing for 60 hours that month. The previous record was 16 hours by the end of April 2011. The mercury topped an unprecedented 30 C north of the Arctic Circle on July 30 in Banak, Norway. Ice begins melting in the Arctic as spring approaches in the Northern Hemisphere, and then it usually starts building again toward the end of September as the days grow shorter and cooler. A total of 5.7 million square kilometers (2.2 million square miles) of ice covered the Arctic in July, according to the Colorado-based National Snow & Ice Data Center. Through the first two weeks of August, ice extent declined by 65,000 square kilometers each day, according to the NSIDC. “The ice has been retreating by about 10 percent every decade during the last 30 years,” said Miguel Angel Morales Maqueda, senior lecturer in Oceanography at Newcastle University in northern England. “There is no other known explanation than climatic change. If it isn’t climactic change, then we don’t know what it is.” This season is likely headed for the ninth-biggest retreat since satellite measurements began, not as extreme as bigger melting seasons in 2012 and 2007, according to Julienne Stroeve, professor of Polar Observation & Modelling, University College London. “The total ice extent loss is being slowed by winds pushing the ice southwards,” Stroeve said in a message sent from an Arctic research trip. “We likely still have a month of sea ice retreat. The ocean is still warm enough to melt some ice even if air temperatures cool.” LNG exporters are taking advantage of the open waters, most notably around the Yamal LNG gas liquefaction plant in northern Siberia. The project, owned by Total, Novatek and their Chinese partners, has custom-built ARC 7 tankers rugged enough to cut through whatever ice remains in the area. That enables them to sail without help from icebreakers west to Europe year-round and east to Asia during the summer months. In the coming years, more routes will open for ships to sail without an icebreaker. The Yamal venture’s Christophe de Margerie was the world’s first ice-breaking LNG tanker built and collected Yamal’s first cargo to make the trip westward through the Northern Sea Route. In early 2018 though, the Eduard Toll became the first LNG tanker to ever use the full Northern Sea Route in the winter. It traveled from a South Korean shipyard to Sabetta and collected a cargo there from the Yamal LNG plant, then delivered it to France. That shaved about 3,000 nautical miles off the traditional route through the Suez Canal. In July China received two cargoes from Yamal from the first LNG ships to cross the Arctic without help from icebreakers. The net voyage time from the port of Sabetta through the Northern Sea Route to the destination, the Chinese port of Jiangsu Rudong, was completed in 19 days, compared with 35 days for the traditional eastern route via the Suez Canal and the Strait of Malacca. Routes like that may save Yamal $46 million in shipping costs for the remainder of the year, those savings could quadruple by 2023. Traffic is picking up. The Northern Sea Route saw 9.7 million tons of cargo shipped through it in 2017, according to the Russian Federal Agency for Maritime and River Transport. There were 615 voyages along the Northern Sea Route this year through July 15, about the same as in 2017, said Balmasov at Arctic Logistics. The Russian government is targeting cargo traffic through that route totaling 80 million tons by 2024. “The main difference to 2017 is LNG deliveries from the port of Sabetta,” Balmasov said. “Our data show that as of early July, 34 tankers were dispatched from Sabetta towards European ports, and one voyage was east-bound.” Since then, two more ships have moved from Yamal to Asian markets in the east, though the most icy part of the Northern Sea Route.
It is in this way that legal thought folds in on itself. Not so long ago, one might reasonably have believed that rightness disputes were designed and conducted to ascertain the value of the thought or the thinker. Now, however, we seem to be on the other side of an inversion. Now, both the thought and the thinker serve as occasions and vehicles for the prosecution and adjudication of rightness disputes. Combined with a furious focus on productivity and the ferocious pursuit of self-promotion, the rightness orientation leads legal thought to fold in on itself. This fold is perhaps most easily exemplified in the rankings mania. Once it was thought that the rankings were reflective, or at least supposed to be reflective, of excellence (or the lack thereof). The rankings could be praised or criticized for their success or failure in evaluating excellence. The rankings served as a proxy for excellence. But now rankings mania has folded in on itself. What matters now is not the logic of the proxy, but the logic of self-reference. The whole point of rankings is to rank - just as the whole point of self-promotion is to self-promote and the whole point of publishing is to publish. There is no significant external end. Not long ago, this was the kind of outre claim one might expect of a French philosopher (Baudrillard 1990).Today, it’s just a banal observation. What then can we say of legal thought? It is what it is. If this seems unduly grim, realize that this ubiquitous phrase, "it is what it is" has a wonderfully ambivalent and ironic cast. On the one hand, it implies resignation, as in "it is what it is and there's not much to be done about it." But the phrase also implies a certain mature reflection as in, "it is what it is and so better to focus your energies elsewhere." CODA Be intellectually serious. Drop the received scholarly agendas. Forget reflective equilibrium. Ditch the ideal observer. Throw your copy of "The Concept of Law" into a lake and give "Law's Empire" to a homeless person. Also stop worrying about helping the courts with their various legitimation needs. They don't need you. Really. They'll be just fine. Instead, try to find the best description you can of whatever might be called the postmodern condition. Maybe Postman or Zengotita or Baudrillard or Lyotard, or whoever. It doesn't really matter. Rather, what matters is that you find some salient description of our contemporary intellectual-cultural condition: A description that seems credible and convincing. Let the condition become your mind and try to think about law from within that condition. Think sociologically. Think normatively if you want - but do it from within that condition. Try to leave the academic formalizations behind. Avoid rightness disputes. If necessary, leave the room. Abjure and disdain scholasticism in all its forms. Avoid tinkering. If you tinker anyway, don't call it philosophy. If you do call your tinkering philosophy, try not to publish it. Try to think from within the as yet undertheorized here and Give it a form. Give law a form. Realize that there is no glory, no virtue, and no challenge in theorizing from the exceedingly well-rehearsed formal frames of jurisprudence and legal philosophy. It's been done. And we do not have a lot to show for it. Instead try to rethink law from a position that is at least plausibly our own. Maybe it'll work for you and maybe it won't. If it does work for you, it's as close as you (and we) are likely to come to doing serious philosophy. Failing that, you can retrieve the soggy book you threw into the lake. But that should be your last, not your first option. Oh hell, it shouldn't be an option at all: Leave the book alone. Just walk away.
Washington (CNN) -- While space travel still gets a lot of attention, not enough attention has been accorded to a major new expedition to the deepest point in the ocean, some 7 miles deep -- the recent journey by James Cameron, on behalf of National Geographic. The cover story of the prestigious journal Foreign Affairs lays out the "Case for Space." "60 Minutes" recently ran a story about the dire effects on Florida's space industry of scaling back our extraterrestrial endeavors. Newt Gingrich gained attention earlier this year by calling for building a permanent base on the moon. And President Obama has talked of preparing to eventually send Americans into orbit around Mars. Actually, there are very good reasons to stop spending billions of dollars on manned space missions, to explore space in ways that are safer and much less costly, and to grant much higher priority to other scientific and engineering mega-projects, the oceans in particular. The main costs of space exploration arise from the fact that we are set on sending humans, rather than robots. The reasons such efforts drive up the costs include: A human needs a return ticket, while a robot can go one way. Space vehicles for humans must be made safe, while we can risk a bunch of robots without losing sleep. Robots are much easier to feed, experience little trouble when subject to prolonged weightlessness, and are much easier to shield from radiation. And they can do most tasks humans can. British astronomer royal Martin Rees writes, "I think that the practical case (for manned flights) gets weaker and weaker with every advance in robotics and miniaturization. It's hard to see any particular reason or purpose in going back to the moon or indeed sending people into space at all." Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg calls manned missions "an incredible waste of money" and argues that "for the cost of putting a few people on a very limited set of locations on Mars we could have dozens of unmanned, robotic missions roving all over Mars." The main argument for using humans is a public relations one. As Neil deGrasse Tyson puts it in Foreign Affairs, "China's latest space proclamations could conceivably produce another 'Sputnik moment' for the United States, spurring the country into action after a relatively fallow period in its space efforts." Also, astronauts are said to inspire our youth to become scientists and explorers. However, it is far from established that we cannot achieve the same effects by making other R&D projects our main priority. Take the oceans, about which we know much less than the dark side of the moon. Ninety percent of the ocean floor has not even been charted, and while we have been to the moon, the technology to explore the ocean's floors is still being developed. For example, a permanent partially-submerged sea exploration station, called the SeaOrbiter, is currently in development. The oceans play a major role in controlling our climate. But we have not learned yet how to use them to cool us off rather than contribute to our overheating. Ocean organisms are said to hold the promise of cures for an array of diseases. An examination of the unique eyes of skate (ray fish) led to advances in combating blindness, the horseshoe crab was crucial in developing a test for bacterial contamination, and sea urchins helped in the development of test-tube fertilization.
Why Act Utilitarianism Maximizes Utility If every action that we carry out yields more utility than any other action available to us, then the total utility of all our actions will be the highest possible level of utility that we could bring about. In other words, we can maximize the overall utility that is within our power to bring about by maximizing the utility of each individual action that we perform. If we sometimes choose actions that produce less utility than is possible, the total utility of our actions will be less than the amount of goodness that we could have produced. For that reason, act utilitarians argue, we should apply the utilitarian principle to individual acts and not to classes of similar actions. ii. Why Act Utilitarianism is Better than Traditional, Rule-based Moralities Traditional moral codes often consist of sets of rules regarding types of actions. The Ten Commandments, for example, focus on types of actions, telling us not to kill, steal, bear false witness, commit adultery, or covet the things that belong to others. Although the Biblical sources permit exceptions to these rules (such as killing in self-defense and punishing people for their sins), the form of the commandments is absolute. They tell us “thou shalt not do x” rather than saying “thou shalt not do x except in circumstances a, b, or c.” In fact, both customary and philosophical moral codes often seem to consist of absolute rules. The philosopher Immanuel Kant is famous for the view that lying is always wrong, even in cases where one might save a life by lying. According to Kant, if A is trying to murder B and A asks you where B is, it would be wrong for you to lie to A, even if lying would save B’s life (Kant). Act utilitarian’s reject rigid rule-based moralities that identify whole classes of actions as right or wrong. They argue that it is a mistake to treat whole classes of actions as right or wrong because the effects of actions differ when they are done in different contexts and morality must focus on the likely effects of individual actions. It is these effects that determine whether they are right or wrong in specific cases. Act utilitarians acknowledge that it may be useful to have moral rules that are “rules of thumb”—i.e., rules that describe what is generally right or wrong, but they insist that whenever people can do more good by violating a rule rather than obeying it, they should violate the rule. They see no reason to obey a rule when more well-being can be achieved by violating it. iii. Why Act Utilitarianism Makes Moral Judgments Objectively True One advantage of act utilitarianism is that it shows how moral questions can have objectively true answers. Often, people believe that morality is subjective and depends only on people’s desires or sincere beliefs. Act utilitarianism, however, provides a method for showing which moral beliefs are true and which are false. Once we embrace the act utilitarian perspective, then every decision about how we should act will depend on the actual or foreseeable consequences of the available options. If we can predict the amount of utility/good results that will be produced by various possible actions, then we can know which ones are right or wrong. Although some people doubt that we can measure amounts of well-being, we in fact do this all the time. If two people are suffering and we have enough medication for only one, we can often tell that one person is experiencing mild discomfort while the other is in severe pain. Based on this judgment, we will be confident that we can do more good by giving the medication to the person suffering extreme pain. Although this case is very simple, it shows that we can have objectively true answers to questions about what actions are morally right or wrong. Jeremy Bentham provided a model for this type of decision making in his description of a “hedonic calculus,” which was meant to show what factors should be used to determine amounts of pleasure and happiness, pain and suffering. Using this information, Bentham thought, would allow for making correct judgments both in individual cases and in choices about government actions and policies.
The question I want to raise about this is whether it might be motivated and thereby explained by the spirit of ressentiment? A number of features which are pertinent here characterize this spirit. First, an inability to ‘let go’, to forget, it cannot have done with anything (Nietzsche 1969:58). It is both a backward-looking spirit—it needs to keep on remembering past injustices—and an expansive spirit—it needs to find new injustices everywhere. In the kinds of institutions, I am concerned with, those in which women have roughly achieved equal power, it can be expressed in the following kind of phenomenon. Where those with institutional power cannot justifiably claim that they are being discriminated against at the level of actions and practices they can maintain their political integrity, their claim to ideological purity and sense of powerlessness by resorting to finding ‘evil’ and injustice in wider and wider circumstances and at deeper and more concealed levels. The issue is no longer just what men say about and do to women but the very nature of language, discourse, culture and society. The enemy is no longer someone with whom you disagree and hence with whom you can argue, but a type—man—who is uncomprehending and unable and unwilling to try, a type who’s very being is recalcitrant to virtue, who is evil. The person motivated by the spirit of ressentiment looks for ‘evil’, needs to recriminate and distribute blame, to impute wrongs, distribute responsibilities and to find sinners. As Nietzsche says, they want others to be evil in order to be able to consider themselves good (Nietzsche 1969:39). As Deleuze says, the man of ressentiment feels ‘the corresponding object as a personal offence and affront because he makes the object responsible for his own powerlessness’ (Deleuze 1983:116). There seems to be two elements here. One is the need to see the other as powerful and responsible for my powerlessness, and then the transformation of this thought into the thought that my powerlessness is a proof of my goodness and the other’s evil. And this works by a revaluation of the enemy’s values— an act of the most spiritual revenge, as Nietzsche says (Nietzsche 1969:34). This makes sense of two aspects of feminist thought. First, the need to see women as helpless victims, as abused, misrepresented, as powerless in the face of such an onslaught of sexist, patriarchal, male power in every dimension of life and thought. Second, in the now frequently asserted claims of women’s moral superiority: that women are caring, nurturant, their relations non-hierarchical, and so on. And seeing ourselves as good gives us a right to demand that others conform to our values. One further aspect of ressentiment worth mentioning here is the inability to admire and respect. In contrast with envy, which allows for the possibility of admiring the work and qualities of those we envy, ressentiment allows for no such thing. If a man gets a job or promotion or a publication it is explained away by the fact that he is a man, using old boys’ networks and so on. And now that women are getting jobs and so on we can see the same type of response on the part of men: she got it only because of affirmative action policies or because of her sexual behaviour. However, in the discussion of ressentiment I do not mean to be attributing particular psychological states to particular individuals, but rather to be diagnosing the spirit of some current feminist discursive and non-discursive practices. The issue is why it is that now that women have achieved considerable formal and substantial equality—at least in the institutions I am concerned with—this has not proven enough. My concern is not with ressentiment as individual psychology but with the way this is played out politically. Women have quite reasonably wanted power, but perhaps, entangled in the spirit of ressentiment (quite unsurprisingly given our oppression throughout history) we have failed to be sufficiently critical about what it was that we wanted in wanting power. We wanted what it was that we believed the others had: power over.
The debate about U.S. immigration policy is a difficult and often emotional one. In recent years, a new component has been added. Shifting focus away from a debate based on the merits of various policy options, some of those advocating higher levels of immigration and amnesty for illegal aliens have resorted to attacking and impugning the motives of their opponents.
This parti pris of responding to a brutal political and military situation with a mystico-literary self-stylization constitutes the force and originality, but also, for some, the deeply unsatisfying ambiguity of Bataille's mystical subversion. Understanding Bataille's concerns in this way shows, in any event, why Bataille's position with respect to the violence of the war could only be enacted/communicated performatively. What Bataille sought to present was not a set of ethical propositions or rationally coordinated political theses, but rather a style of life that, considered as a (lacerated but living) whole, offered an alternative to the values and forms of existence that had found their culmination in totalitarian oppression and war. The life of mysticism and expenditure Bataille proposed could not, he claimed, be adequately described in the language of philosophical, social scientific, or political discourse. This mode of life could only be grasped in its realization (performance) in the existence of an exemplary being: the mystical writer, Bataille himself. Distancing himself from the "professorial" attitude of academic philosophers like Heidegger, whose "method remains glued to results," Bataille affirmed: "what counts in my eyes is the moment of ungluing [decollement]. What I teach (if it is true that . . . ) is an intoxication, not a philosophy. I am not a philosopher, but a saint, maybe a madman" (BOC V, 218 note; ellipsis in original). Bataille was convinced that the meditational method and more broadly the mystical style of existence he made available through his writings opened the route to a concrete experience of the heterogeneity and sovereignty of the self and thus laid the groundwork for genuine freedom. The inner experience of freedom remains the precondition of any meaningful deployment of freedom in the public, political world. And if freedom can be understood in Kantian terms as autolegislation, then mystical writing initiates autonomy by showing people that they carry the supreme law within themselves, by teaching them to experience themselves as their own law (a law constituted through endless contestation). "Man is his own law if he strips himself naked before himself. The mystic before God had the attitude of a subject. Whoever places being before himself has the attitude of a sovereign" (BOC V, 278). The "naked" sovereign of inner experience, "knowing that he  [the self] will die" (278), finds freedom tempered with the awareness of radical vulnerability and contingency, thus making freedom inseparable from "compassion" (273), or as Bataille will later write, from a tragic "loyalty" (BOC XI, 541-45). Without the sacrificial knowledge of its own penetration by death, the self's exercise of freedom would inevitably become an "exercise of power" over others (BOC V, 221). Instead, inner experience is a sacrificial "conquest" of the self "for others" (76). Sovereignty is not static governance but tireless "revolt" (221). Through an unruly mixture of steamy confession, dense philosophical analysis, histrionic bluster, parodic prayers, lachrymose lamentation, "mimicry," and irony, Bataille's textual mysticism undermines or overflows the conceptual structures on which the logic of domination relies. It attacks utility, rationality, hierarchical order, and identity. By affirming a useless inner experience as in itself "sole authority, sole value" (BOC V, 18), mysticism challenges the right of coercive political systems to claim ultimate value and unlimited authority for themselves. By introducing — through "auto-sacrificial" writing — the toxin of the impossible into calculations of human meaning, Bataille sought to reach the "underside" of language and human experience, to uncover the "nakedness" of irreducible anguish that philosophy and political theory had sought to conceal, and to "annul the effects of totalizing discourse," both in the philosophical and in the political realms.56 For better or worse (for better and worse), Bataille's writing not only reveals but is the heart of his politics. The impossible practice of this writing puts on display the forces that made Bataille momentarily sensitive to fascism's seductions, but that also propelled him irresistibly away from the fascist orbit: his "monstrosities in the end rebellious toward all political camps."57 It was this spiritual and political monstrosity — irreducible heterogeneity, death-obsessed sacredness, ironic "sainthood"—that Bataille hoped to make contagious. Not by analyzing it, but by being it. The content of Bataille's message was himself: himself as mystic, as one who speaks of death from within death. In his mystical texts Bataille produces himself as one who lives and writes a hauteur de mort. He demonstrates the confrontation with death in a context that is precisely not that of the battlefield, in order to show that death's impossible and necessary truth belongs not to the soldiers plunged in the "vain noise of combat," but to the " 'men of religious death' or sacrifice" who raise up death's "bloody but wholly resplendent image" in the midst of a "sacred silence" (BOC II, 238). This is the point Bataille considers it urgent to drive home: that in war or peace human life only begins to deploy its richness when death is internalized and when life can be affirmed and loved in and through death. Bataille as the mystic o "la joie supplidante" embodies this affirmation. Bataille does not merely articulate the claim, he is the claim that a life lived in the mad intensity of the hauteur de mort is the only life worth having. One can only "have" such a life when one sacrifices it. And one can only sacrifice it if one loses life consciously: through what Bataille variously terms "dramatization," "comedy," "mimetism." By writing his own mystical dissolution, Bataille shows how it is possible to "watch [one]self ceasing to be" (HDS, 19). He models the process through which, like the Tibetan monk in the burial ground, one can be penetrated by the secrets of death, while "the body thus treated remains intact" (BOC VII, 2.59). What arises in the experience of Bataille's writing  is not an irremediable mise-a-mort, but instead a better way of encountering death's power reality and obviousness which are obscene. It is the truth we should laugh at. You can imagine a culture where everyone laughs spontaneously when someone says: `This is true', `This is real'. All this defines the irresolvable relationship between thought and reality. A certain form of thought is bound to the real. It starts out from the hypothesis that ideas have referents and that there is a possible ideation of reality. A comforting polarity, which is that of tailor-made dialectical and philosophical solutions. The other form of thought is eccentric to the real, a stranger to dialectics, a stranger even to critical thought. It is not even a disavowal of the concept of reality. It is illusion, power of illusion, or, in other words, a playing with reality, as seduction is a playing with desire, as metaphor is a playing with truth. This radical thought does not stem from a philosophical doubt, a utopian transference, or an ideal transcendence. It is the material illusion, immanent in this so-called `real' world. And thus it seems to come from elsewhere. It seems to be the extrapolation of this world into another world. At all events, there is incompatibility between thought and the real. There is no sort of necessary or natural transition from the one to the other. Neither alternation, nor alternative: only otherness and distance keep them charged up. This is what ensures the singularity of thought, the singularity by which constitutes an event, just like the singularity of the world, the singularity by which it too constitutes an event.
In matters of foreign policy, Mexico is an afterthought—our attention and resources are diverted to the Middle East or to grand strategies based on ‘pivoting’ our geopolitical and economical capacity towards Asia. With the U.S. economy performing at a snail-like pace, an emphasis on exports has re-emerged, but the bulk of the exporting narrative revolves around Asia. This is unfortunate, because our neighbor to the south has quietly positioned itself to be the next jewel in the emerging markets portfolio. For example, Market Watch (a Wall Street Journal subsidiary) recently published a bullish article on Mexico with the following headline: “Mexico: Investor’s New China”. The Economist published an opinion piece titled “The Global Mexican: Mexico is open for business”, highlighting Mexican companies that are investing locally and in the U.S. and arguing that Mexico is fertile ground for more investment, especially in the manufacturing sector. And according to The Financial Times, BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) are no longer the flavor of the month; Mexico is now taking over that distinction. In essence, immigration and the drug trade will no longer anchor the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico; instead, economics, finance, trade, and commerce will dictate the terms between the neighboring countries.
Brown is pressing lawmakers to extend California's cap-and-trade legislation, which puts a limit on carbon emissions and requires polluters to obtain permits to release greenhouse gases. The governor touts the program around the world as an effective way to affordably address climate change, but its legal authorization expires in 2020. The current proposal would expand the program until 2030.
In exercising his authority to export controls, the President is directed to establish and maintain lists of items subject to control, lists of foreign persons or end-uses subject to control, licensing criteria and licensing alternatives – such as advanced notice in lieu of licensing, and compliance and enforcement measures. It expands the definition of dual-use items to include those that could be used for cyber or terrorist attacks. The legislation establishes penalties consistent with the IEEPA penalties (see above). The legislation also directs the President to establish an inter-agency Transfer Policy Committee to identify strategic threats requiring export controls and to implement policies to counter those threats. This committee is also charged with regularly reviewing the control list and establishing and maintaining a licensing system. The legislation requires the President to maintain current license requirements on countries supporting international terrorism, as well as current sanctions regarding missile proliferation and chemical and biological weapons proliferation. It also reauthorizes the anti-boycott provisions from the EAA.
The Department of Energy’s Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (DOE EPSCoR) was established by Section 2203 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-486). DOE EPSCoR enhances the capability of 25 eligible states and Puerto Rico to conduct sustainable and nationally competitive energy-related research, increase the number of competitive scientists and engineers in energy-related areas, and build beneficial relationships between designated states and territories and the 10 world-class laboratories managed by the Office of Science, leveraging DOE national user facilities and intellectual collaboration. The DOE EPSCoR effort to develop science and engineering research infrastructure and human resources enables the states to contribute to the current and future energy-related needs.
A historical analogy might be drawn to the study of nuclear issues. In many ways, today’s state of affairs regarding public discourse on cyberattack is analogous to the nuclear debate of 50 years ago. At that time, nuclear policy issues were veiled in secrecy, and there was little public debate about them. Herman Kahn’s books (On Thermonuclear War, Thinking the Unthinkable) were the first that addressed in the open literature what it might mean to fight a nuclear war. These seminal pieces did much to raise the public profile of these issues and stimulated an enormous amount of subsequent work outside government that has had a real impact on nuclear policy. From our perspective as the co-chairs of this study, the topic of cyberattack is so important across a multitude of national interests—not just defense or even just national security—that it deserves robust and open discussion and debate, both among thoughtful professionals in the policy, military, intelligence, law enforcement, and legal fields and among security practitioners in the private sector. But for such discussion and debate to be productive, they must be based on some common foundation of information about the topic at hand. Thus, the report’s role in providing education and background is in our view its most important function.
Oil Spills Inflict Devastating Economic Losses Upon Coastal Communities Oil spills exact a serious toll on coastal economies, including our approximately $35 billion commercial fishing and $60 billion ocean and coastal tourism and recreation industries. The damage and clean up costs following the Exxon Valdez spill were so extensive that Exxon paid out more than one billion dollars to the federal and state governments for damages and clean up costs—and still owes fishermen, Alaska Natives, business owners, and others a billion dollars to redress the spill’s harm. In another example of economic and environmental damage, a July 2008 accident between a chemical tanker and an oil barge discharged more than 270,000 gallons of fuel oil, closing a huge swath of the Lower Mississippi River to vessel traffic for several days. The Port of New Orleans, located at the center of the world’s busiest port complex, was shut down and residents were asked to conserve water when water intakes were closed to prevent contamination of drinking water.
The ongoing nuclear crisis in Japan in the aftermath of the triple reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex serves as a permanent reminder of the unacceptable risks posed by the current fleet of nuclear plants. Given the latency period between exposure even to "low" doses of radiation and the manifestation of disease, we may not know the true health effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster for decades. The experience of the 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident demonstrates that negative health effects can last generations, cause immense suffering and trigger other fatal and non-fatal illnesses as well as birth defects. Even the routine radioactive releases from nuclear power plants can prove fatal. Studies in Germany and France found elevated rates of leukemia among children living near nuclear power plants. The situation at Fukushima remains perilous and could still become orders of magnitude worse. A technology that has the capacity to poison human resources and render vast areas unfit for habitation for decades, even centuries, cannot be endorsed by environmentalists and runs contrary to the best interests of humanity.
However, research conducted by our respective organizations, Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission, and even the State Department’s own reports, demonstrates conclusively that Mexico has failed to meet the four human rights requirements set out by law. As a result, Congress should not release these select Merida funds. Releasing these funds would send the message that the United States condones the grave human rights violations committed in Mexico, including torture, rape, killings, and enforced disappearances. We recognize that Mexico is facing a severe public security crisis, and that the United States can play a constructive role in strengthening Mexico’s ability to confront organized crime in an effective manner. However, human rights violations committed by Mexican security forces are not only deplorable in their own right, but also significantly undermine the effectiveness of Mexico’s public security efforts. Building trust between the Mexican people and the government is essential to gathering information to dismantle organized crime. When security forces commit grave human rights violations and they are not held accountable for their actions, they lose that trust, alienating key allies and leaving civilians in a state of terror and defenselessness. It is thus in the interest of both of our countries to help Mexico curb systematic human rights violations, ensure that violations are effectively investigated and those responsible held accountable, and assess candidly the progress Mexico is making towards improving accountability and transparency. Evidence demonstrates that Mexico is not fulfilling effectively any of the requirements established by Congress, particularly those dealing with prosecuting military abuses and torture:
The defence against critiques that attempt to recover the violent history of liberalism is that ‘it is a mistake to throw out the language of equal worth and self-determination because of its contingent association with [end page 27] the historical configurations of Western power’ (Held 2004, 156-7). Yet, historically speaking, the emergence of the modern European state system was ‘coterminous with, and indissociable from, the genocide of the indigenous peoples of the “new” world, the enslavement of the natives of the African continent, and the colonisation of the societies of Asia’ (Krishna 2001, 401). While the urge to imperialism is inherent in liberalism but not a necessary outcome (Mehta 1999), Western liberalism has a bloody history. As Jahn argues, liberalism’s ‘others’ are excluded from liberal norms because the definition of otherness ‘is prior ’ to theories of politics and the international (Jahn 2005, 618, emphasis in the original). Held asks us not to dismiss liberalism because it contains the promise that one day, via some of the very actors that are implicated in the emergence of this state of affairs, the world’s problems will be solved or at least mitigated. The effect of this is to enact a strategy common to International Relations discourse: the ‘eternal deferment of the possibility of overcoming the alienation of international society that commenced in 1492’, which serves to justify contemporary and historical violence and inequality because ‘the present is inscribed as a transitional phase whose violent and unequal character is expiated on the altar of that which is to come’ (Krishna 2001, 402). Liberal accounts of globalisation, global civil society and progressive change thus serve to entrench and perpetuate some of the very practices they claim to oppose. While NGOs are often some of the most vocal critics in world politics, we need to understand the historical context of their emergence and of the values they seek to promote. Liberalism’s self-image as tolerant, inclusive and non-violent does not match up to its historical expression. As such, the liberal practices and values promoted by NGOs are also worthy of critical scrutiny.
Time and again Fidel Castro has taken an American overture or challenge and, using a Fidelista jujitsu, turned it to his own advantage. In the process, countless families like mine have been whipsawed between hope and despair. Mr. Castro’s enduring tactic has been to fit each initiative to his revolutionary script of a brave Cuba resisting the giant United States. Framed that way, attempts to bring down the regime strengthened it. Efforts to democratize Cuba left freedoms further restricted. Presidents came and went, but the constants were disappointment, and Fidel. Now with Mr. Castro ailing and a new president about to be inaugurated — the eleventh to hold office since Havana fell 50 years ago this month — another match in this long competition is about to begin. The half-century has been a roller coaster for Cuba and the United States. Dwight Eisenhower was quick to recognize Mr. Castro’s government, and quick to slam shut the diplomatic door. John Kennedy got stung at the Bay of Pigs. Lyndon Johnson was uninterested in negotiating with Castro; so was Richard Nixon until his opening to China made him and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, think they could do something similar with Cuba. Mr. Kissinger tried, and continued under President Ford, but got nowhere. In all that time, my wife, Miriam, who had left at age 10 in the tumultuous months between the Bay of Pigs and the 1962 missile crisis, had little contact with her family in Cuba. A phone call was near impossible, and sending anything by mail was a test of patience and luck. But soon after President Carter took office, he opened a United States Interests Section in Havana and allowed Cuba to do the same in Washington. That’s where we went in 1978 for visas so Miriam could visit her father for the first time since 1962, and I could see Cuba too. The ferocious tension of the past seemed to have abated when we reunited with her family at José Martí Airport, and Miriam, now married, could hug her father one last time. There were other reasons for hope. Mr. Castro had released some 3,500 political prisoners and promised to make it easy for some Cubans to leave. We filled out immigration papers for Miriam’s younger brother. Maybe the worst was over. But it wasn’t. Mr. Castro, flush with Soviet aid, had tens of thousands of troops (including Miriam’s stepbrother) in Angola and was itching to get into Ethiopia. Robert A. Pastor, President Carter’s national security adviser for Latin America, warned Mr. Castro that entering Ethiopia would end further normalization. Mr. Castro sent troops anyway. As relations deteriorated, he accused Washington of reneging on immigration promises, and threw open the port of Mariel along with prisons, hospitals and insane asylums. More than 120,000 refugees landed on Florida’s shores, backing the United States into taking them all. Mr. Pastor told me there was a lesson in this: that President-elect Barack Obama’s promises to move toward normalization if Cuba democratizes probably won’t work, because Mr. Castro has never accepted that equation. “We long ago overestimated how important normalization and lifting the embargo were for Castro, and we’re still doing it,” he said. The threat, real or invented, of United States attacks has been a central element of Mr. Castro’s revolutionary identity, and the embargo his call to arms.
Native American Heritage Month (November) is when we reflect on the heritage of the first people in the Americas and honor their traditions and ancestors. North America before the time of contact with Europeans five hundred years ago was a mosaic of extraordinary human diversity. Hundreds of tribes had their own cultures, political systems, art forms, spiritual beliefs–and languages. By the late 19th Century all that had changed. Most tribes had been restricted to reservations. Many of their children were taken to boarding schools where they were required to speak only in English as part of a program to assimilate Native Americans into the white culture. Native American languages were mainly dead or dying. By the late 20th Century, more than half the Native Americans in the U.S. were living in urban areas, where English was their everyday and home language. The few remaining Native American languages still in use were increasingly spoken only by the elders. But there has been a resilience among the first people of North America in the 21st Century, and many of them have been determined to hang on to their heritage. Others are looking for ways to revitalize traditional cultures, spiritual values–and languages. One organization that has been established to record the disappearing languages around the world, including those of North America–and perhaps to help revitalize those that are on the brink of extinction–is the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. Living Tongues has linked up with the National Geographic Society to form the Enduring Voices Project, which strives to preserve endangered languages by identifying language hotspots–the places with the most unique, poorly understood, or threatened indigenous languages–and documenting the languages and cultures within them. Under the Enduring Voices Project, linguists journey to meet with last speakers, listen to their stories, and document their languages with film, pictures, and audio to help communities preserve their knowledge of species, landscapes, and traditions before they vanish, according to the project’s Web site. “In addition, the Enduring Voices Project, where invited, will assist indigenous communities in their efforts to revitalize and maintain their threatened languages. By using appropriate written materials, video, still photography, audio recorders, and computers with language software, as well as access through the Internet where possible, the Enduring Voices Project will help empower communities to preserve ancient traditions with modern technology,” the Web site adds. I spoke to Dr. Greg Anderson, director of Living Tongues, about the disappearing languages of the U.S. and what’s been done to document, if not save them. Why should we care about preserving languages? Whether for heritage or scientific reasons, languages need to be recorded. Every language is useful as a means to identify a group. It codifies the history and world view of a people. It’s clear that it’s important to many people that they have their language that identifies them uniquely as a group. Most native communities in the U.S. want to have as good and accurate record of their language as possible, in a format to be enjoyed by as many people as possible. There is great interest in documenting this heritage. Documenting a disappearing language is so important, but it’s possible only to really begin to appreciate all the subtleties and complexities of language if you have some speakers left to give you the dynamics and social context. If a language goes then it can’t find new life without recorded materials. “Every language furthers and refines our understanding of cognition, communications systems, the nature of the mind and the different ways people categorize our collective human experience.” From a scientific perspective it is also imperative to document languages while they are still alive. Languages are markers of identity and group cohesion. Linguists will tell you that every language furthers and refines our understanding of cognition, communications systems, the nature of the mind and the different ways people categorize our collective human experience. For scientists, who knows what benefits there will be down the line that we don’t even know about now yet. Certainly there will be uses for the data. But you can be sure it won’t be used if it’s not documented. Tell us about the language hotspots in North America. In the Enduring Voices project, we focus on the situation of languages in hotspots. Several hotspots have been identified in North America, most notably in Oklahoma. It is where we find a concentration of unique languages that are vanishing. These are the priority areas for future work in language documentation. The idea is to create areas where efforts need to be concentrated, where the number and different types of languages have consequences that are greater collectively for humanity. Each language is of course equally valued, but we have a finite number of people, dollars, and time to do this work, so we need to maximize our efforts and resources. In North America there are 150-170 languages that still have at least one speaker. Many of these languages have fewer than a hundred speakers. There are very few languages that have decent prospects of surviving without significant effort on the part of their communities to continue to find a use for them. Oregon was probably the most diverse region of languages in the U.S. California might have the claim, but it is much larger, so the award for density of linguistic diversity goes to Oregon. “At the time Lewis and Clark arrived in what’s now Oregon 200 years ago there were 14 language families, more than in all of Europe combined.” At the time Lewis and Clark arrived in what’s now Oregon 200 years ago there were 14 language families, more than in all of Europe combined. Today only five families of languages exist, and most of them have only a handful of speakers. There is only one language family that has more than a hundred or two hundred speakers, and that’s Northern Paiute, in southeastern Oregon, where the elders can still speak it when they get together. For most of the rest of the people there the everyday language is English. The vast majority of the remaining languages in Oregon are known only by very few elders. The language diversity of that region has fallen off a cliff. There has been some documentation of these languages, but mostly just as text, and often a hundred years old. The complexity of the setting of these texts, and the sounds of the languages have often been lost. With the loss of the languages, all kinds of wonderful things that the speakers did with their languages have also vanished, for example, some of the greatest works of oral literature ever produced–the multilingual performances with different characters speaking different languages that was found in the Pacific Northwest. The highly elaborate dances that accompanied the oral tradition are frequently also gone. Large amounts of local knowledge about fauna and flora, ecosystem management, local place names, spiritual values, and so on are all submerged, altered or gone because the original languages that expressed these concepts are gone or no longer well understood. How is this situation being addressed? Two directions. We have tried to do a little through the Enduring Voices program, which has been quite effective at raising public awareness about the issue of language endangement. A longer-term arrangement is through Living Tongues, where we plan and execute larger scale projects. These are the main ways we engage the communities and help them to document and revitalize their languages. Through Enduring Voices, we have been helping the Winnemem Wintu, one of the indigenous peoples of north central California. We have given them a technology kit and are providing training to help them compile video and audio recordings, with the purpose of producing language revitalization materials for their language. Winnemem Wintu representatives are going to take part in an Enduring Voices workshop in Santa Fe next April. They will be joined by representatives of the Sac and Fox tribes, who are also interested in maintaining their Sauk language. Our workshop takes people step by step through the raw data they collect and shows them how to produce a book or audio or some other product they can use to document their language and/or to teach others to speak it. There is a long process between raw data and usable material. But the communities themselves must want to collect the data and do something with it. This is really the only way that languages will survive into the future, if activists in the communities are interested in maintaining their language. How communities use their language is up to them. It can be informal, such as by producing a reader, or formal, such as a course taught in schools. Languages can be revitalized by finding new users and creating new uses for them. Some communities outsource this work to us. We have been working with the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians in Oregon and helping them build a talking dictionary. It now has many thousands of words. Only the tribe has access to it. It is knowledge they want to keep to themselves, which is their right. Once a language is dead it is pretty hard to imagine how it could be brought back. When you are down to only a few speakers you can find ways to build speaker communities, such as happened successfully in Hawaii, where they have created new speakers. Language nests have been built in other native American communities with some success. The Cherokee in Oklahoma have shown great success in generating new speakers with their immersion school. The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, a casino-funded tribe, has resources and the will to support language regeneration programs, and have successfully generated new speakers of Chinuk Wawa, the lingua franca of many Oregon reservations of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This shows that it is possible to reclaim languages. If you have five speakers of a language and you start immersion schools you can produce 25 speakers. Then you can multiply those again. The Cherokee can be thinking of thousands and tens of thousands of speakers of their language on this basis ultimately. It is a model that has worked. Children are sponges and absorb languages easily. If they are placed in a language immersion situation where everyone is speaking the language they will become fluent. Preserving languages should be of interest to everyone, right? Enduring Voices is promoting the key hotspots issue in your backyard. Sure there are vanishing languages around the globe, but your neighbors might be speakers of one of them. Most people appreciate that diversity is good. You wouldn’t want to be allowed to eat only one kind of ice cream flavor or only one type of food always and forever with no options. “The loss of any language is a loss for us all. We lose part of the human genius, and with the disappearance of a language also goes a lot of spiritual concepts, art, and so on.” The loss of any language is a loss for us all. We lose part of the human genius, and with the disappearance of a language also goes a lot of spiritual concepts, art, and so on. There is also the concept that you don’t have to be tied to one language, or worse, be forced to learn one over another. You don’t have to give up one language for another. People are capable of learning and appreciating more than one language. Multilingualism is the norm in many parts of the world. How do you find languages to rescue? We wait for people to come to us. Native American communities tend to be cautious with outsiders. They are also perfectly capable of finding the information through the media and public information sources, and through word of mouth, if they want to do something about preserving their language. We will work with any North American community, no matter what the size or the state of their language (unless it has no speakers and was never recorded of course), to see what kinds of solutions might be possible.

A Nature Geoscience paper (published online) has found that man-made climate change might delay the onset of the next ice age, expected to begin some 1,500 years from now. This has caused quite a stir among climate skeptics, who have rushed to proclaim that man-made climate change " may save us from the next ice age". This enthusiastic reporting neatly exposes some inconsistencies in a few of their favourite arguments. The Nature Geoscience paper: Man-made emissions may delay ice age It's thought that ice ages are triggered by small changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun. The pattern of these changes indicate that another ice age might begin in around 1,500 years. However, scientists have now found that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are warming the Earth enough to prevent it from responding in the way that it has over the last million years. Professor Jim Channell, University of Florida, one of the report's co-authors, explains: "We know from past records that Earth's orbital characteristics during our present interglacial period are a dead ringer for orbital characteristics in an interglacial period 780,000 years ago." Scientists would expect the Earth to behave in a similar way to that period, but human greenhouse gas emissions may have disrupted the normal glaciation cycle. As Channell puts it: "The problem is that now we have added to the total amount of CO2 cycling through the system by burning fossil fuels, the cooling forces can't keep up." Skeptics struggle to get their story straight This finding has prompted an excited response from climate skeptic lobbyists and certain newspapers, who are claiming that man-made global warming will ' thwart' the next ice age and is therefore a good thing. There are three reasons why this is an odd argument. First, it is a tacit admission that man-made climate change is happening, will alter temperatures significantly, and has far-reaching consequences for human society. This might seem like a surprising thing for climate skeptics to admit. It's hardly news however that climate skeptic arguments are often selective and incoherent - as we discussed following the publication of the BEST study results. Secondly, on at least two occasions last year (see here and here for examples), skeptics were claiming that the Earth was poised to enter a new 'mini ice age'. To subsequently trade on the idea that climate change is good because it will prevent ice ages does look suspiciously like having it both ways at once. But the biggest problem for the skeptics is that being pleased about a (potential) lack of climate disruption occurring 1,500 years into the future does rather beg the question of why they aren't worried about climate disruption occurring much sooner - over the next century, say. It's a basic error to sensationalise a possible event that's more than a thousand years away while ignoring the disruption to the climate expected in the interim - but this is exactly what the media coverage does. The Daily Mail opt for the headline ' Human carbon emissions could put OFF a lethal new ice age, say scientists' - parroting the skeptic blogs in claiming that "we would be better off in a warmer world." This statement doesn't fit with the most comprehensive assessment of the scientific literature to date - that conducted by the IPCC in 2007 ( AR4). Meanwhile the Telegraph turn to climate skeptic lobbyists the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) for their information: "The Global Warming Policy Foundation said the study demonstrated that man-made carbon dioxide emissions were preventing a 'global disaster'". ...in 1500 years time, surely? "The think tank, set up by Lord Lawson, cited a controversial theory proposed by Sir Fred Hoyle and Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe in 1999 which said we 'must look to a sustained greenhouse effect to maintain the present advantageous world climate.'" One might wonder why the GWPF are focusing on a potential benefit which is 1,500 years away, on the basis of a single scientific paper, when they are so vociferous in their rejection of the consensus scientific position, which is supported by the work of thousands of researchers. Missing the point Indeed, the reaction of skeptics to this study misses the point, according to co-author Dr Luke Skinner, department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge. He points out that the skeptic notion that we are somehow 'preserving' our climate by releasing greenhouse gases is flawed: "Where we're going is not maintaining our currently warm climate but heating it much further, and adding CO2 to a warm climate is very different from adding it to a cold climate. "The rate of change with CO2 is basically unprecedented, and there are huge consequences if we can't cope with that." Skinner also comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "If anything, the study... suggests that the climate system is quite sensitive to quite small changes in CO2, let alone the huge change that we've been responsible for over the last 200 years." In other words, what Dr Skinner is saying is that you can't have it both ways. If human greenhouse gas emissions are capable of preventing disruptive climate shifts in 1,500 years time, they're capable of causing disruptive climate shifts well before then. After all, the average global temperature difference during an ice age can be as little as 4°C - and we might see that by the end of the century, never mind in 1,500 years' time.
The Obama administration relies on drones for one simple reason: they work. According to data compiled by the New America Foundation, since Obama has been in the White House, U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,300 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban—top figures who are not easily replaced. In 2010, Osama bin Laden warned his chief aide, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was later killed by a drone strike in the Waziristan region of Pakistan in 2011, that when experienced leaders are eliminated, the result is “the rise of lower leaders who are not as experienced as the former leaders” and who are prone to errors and miscalculations. And drones also hurt terrorist organizations when they eliminate operatives who are lower down on the food chain but who boast special skills: passport forgers, bomb makers, recruiters, and fundraisers.¶ Drones have also undercut terrorists’ ability to communicate and to train new recruits. In order to avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda and Taliban operatives try to avoid using electronic devices or gathering in large numbers. A tip sheet found among jihadists in Mali advised militants to “maintain complete silence of all wireless contacts” and “avoid gathering in open areas.” Leaders, however, cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire group of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda’s command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders.¶ Critics of drone strikes often fail to take into account the fact that the alternatives are either too risky or unrealistic. To be sure, in an ideal world, militants would be captured alive, allowing authorities to question them and search their compounds for useful information. Raids, arrests, and interrogations can produce vital intelligence and can be less controversial than lethal operations. That is why they should be, and indeed already are, used in stable countries where the United States enjoys the support of the host government. But in war zones or unstable countries, such as Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, arresting militants is highly dangerous and, even if successful, often inefficient. In those three countries, the government exerts little or no control over remote areas, which means that it is highly dangerous to go after militants hiding out there. Worse yet, in Pakistan and Yemen, the governments have at times cooperated with militants. If the United States regularly sent in special operations forces to hunt down terrorists there, sympathetic officials could easily tip off the jihadists, likely leading to firefights, U.S. casualties, and possibly the deaths of the suspects and innocent civilians.
House passes Freedom Act in effort to curb NSA spying, despite withdrawn industry support Summary: The bill was designed to curb NSA surveillance. But many groups have withdrawn their support after it was "watered down." Next stop, the Senate. The U.S. House today voted to pass the Freedom Act, the decade-after follow-up to the Patriot Act, which first authorized massive global and domestic surveillance in the wake the September 11 terrorist attacks. With more than 152 co-sponsors, the bill passed by a wide majority of 303-121. However, the real fight is now in the Senate's hands, which according to congressional sources will aim to counter some of the lobbying effort by the Obama administration by strengthening previously removed provisions. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), the bill's author — who also introduced the Patriot Act just weeks after the attacks on New York in 2001 — previously said that the new bill was designed to counter the "misuse" of the original powers by the U.S. government, which "overstepped its authority." It was passed by the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month after months of stagnation. After the bill was jump-started, it was quickly seen as the most prominent and likely legislative effort to restrict government surveillance since the 2001 attacks. However, in prepared remarks on Thursday following the bill's passing, Sensenbrenner admitted that he wishes the bill "closely resembled" the bill he first introduced. "The legislation passed today is a step forward in our efforts to reform the government’s surveillance authorities," he said. "It bans bulk collection, includes important privacy provisions, and sends a clear message to the NSA: We are watching you." But the wider technology industry and privacy groups took a stronger stance in recent days by pulling their support for the bill. "What is being considered is not the bill that was marked up by the House Judiciary Committee," Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) said on the House floor on Wednesday. "Certain key elements of this bill were changed. I think it's ironic that a bill that was intended to increase transparency was secretly changed between the Committee markup and floor consideration," she added. One of the changes that riled Silicon Valley giants and privacy groups alike was the broad definition of database searching. Under the act as it stands, a search inquiry is allowed if it is a "discrete term," such as a query that would identify a "person, entity, account, address, or device." Previously, the act limited the searches to a "person, entity, or account," which was seen as more specific and restrictive for intelligence agencies. According to Ars Technica, which spoke to Kevin Bankston, policy director of the Open Technology Institute, "It's now dangerously broad and vague." Also, a coalition of the U.S.' largest technology companies, including Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Facebook, warned that certain definitions in the bill would create an "unacceptable loophole" that could enable the bulk collection of internet users' data. The coalition said it would not support the Freedom Act as it currently stands. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said it was "dismayed" by the "gutted" bill, which the privacy group claims does not substantially reform the foreign intelligence gathering statute, known as Section 702, which targets non-U.S. citizens, but has been known to collect American data. "The new version not only adds the undefined words 'address' and 'device,' but makes the list of potential selection terms open-ended by using the term 'such as'," it added in a statement on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Center for Democracy & Technology's chief executive Nuala O'Connor said on Tuesday that: "The bill now offers only mild reform and goes against the overwhelming support for definitively ending bulk collection." Amnesty International also withdrew its support on Thursday, hours before the bill was debated on the House floor. In a statement, the group said: "The bill provides no protection for non-US persons and the provisions designed to protect U.S. persons have been extensively watered down. Significant further reform is necessary in order to ensure the privacy rights of U.S. and non-U.S. persons are respected." The group also urged the Senate to ensure that the bill is "non-discriminatory," and "subject to judicial and democratic control and oversight," among other recommendations. The bill will now move to the Senate, despite the eleventh-hour changes to the House bill, where sources suggest it will be pulled apart and initial provisions designed to restore trust in the U.S. intelligence community will be rewritten and added.
None of which is to suggest that adopting the model would be unproblematic. Kirby recalls how past struggles by marginalized communities in Ireland have been piecemeal and fragmented. As Friedmann [1992: 158} notes, attempts at endogenous development are likely to flounder without external stimulus and help, perhaps particularly from the state. But the Irish state obstructed one of the most notable attempts to establish that economic autonomy which Fotopoulos rightly identifies as crucial, when it opposed the communistic plans of the Glencolumbcille (Co. Donegal) Communal Farming Cooperative in the 1960s to pool labor and rights to use local land [Tucker, undated]. Such opposition is indeed likely to be triggered by attempts to practice IM, since the model is fundamentally incompatible with and often overtly antipathetic to capitalist dynamics (whether there are roles within it for local markets and a decentralized state constitute open questions, vigorously debated amongst IM's proponents). It is this, rather than anti- modernist sentiments, which mainly distinguishes IM from Barry's 'collective ecological management', Lang and Hines' 'new protectionism', Christoff’s 'strong EM', or Friedmann's [1992] 'alternative development'. These could all be described as situated around the junction between 'strong sustainability' and the ideal model in Baker el al.'s ladder, but distinguishable from IM because they appear to accept global marketization 'as a fact' [Friedmann, 1992], seeking to restrain it through intervention. It also follows from most of the analyses reviewed here that the ideal model is not likely to be sustainable on its own: it cannot be applied to 'peripheries' unless it also applies to 'cores' since one of its major functions is to eliminate cores and peripheries. Correspondingly, current attempts within ecological modernization to encourage community-led SD in EU peripheries via bottom-up 'democratic' rural initiatives are arguably futile. For they take as read the wider context of the Single Market set within a global market, with their irresistible forces for concentrating economic power. Expecting the ideal model to develop by 'stealth' in this context could itself be Utopian. How IM discourse can gain currency, and become a cultural and economic project in the face of global, 'ecological' modernization is a difficult question to answer. It is not likely to be attempted in the mainstream until the inability of global modernization to meet the requirements of strong sustainability becomes even more starkly apparent than at present. Some commentators make much of existing, potentially 'transitional', forms that have some significance in impoverished geographical peripheries. They include credit unions, community land banks, LETS, local provident societies, banks and borrowing schemes, community councils, producer cooperatives, permaculture and soft energy projects and 'self-reliant' communes. There is often intense debate about their real revolutionary potential. Some one-time enthusiasts have rejected them because they easily come, perhaps by cooption, to resemble the social- economic forms they were meant to counter [Bookchin, 1995; also Pepper, 1991). However it is hard to resist the conclusion that they may at least contribute to an emerging counterhegemonic consciousness: one that the victims of increasing failures within the mainstream approach to sustainable development might need to draw on before long.
“I would like to see more exploration and research to make sure we know what’s there and what the challenges are of going after it,” said Graedel. “I don’t think we know if we’ll have the resources to meet future demand.” He also wants material scientists to aim their product design and lab investigations at the most common elements, rather than the scarcer ones. Some companies, including GE, Toyota and Ford, are trying to use less rare earth metals in their products, limit waste and/or develop substitute metals. E-waste recycling in Ann Arbor, MI. Photo: George Hotelling Though recycling e-waste cannot satisfy the rapidly growing demand for rare earth metals, it is one way to help alleviate the shortage. Recycling and reusing materials also saves the energy used in mining and processing, conserves resources, and reduces pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that in 2009, 2.37 million tons of electronics were discarded, but only 25 percent was recycled. The European Union recently enacted new e-waste recycling rules requiring member states to recycle 45 percent of all electronic equipment sold starting in 2016, rising to 65 percent by 2019.

The NAFTA Chapter 11 Loewen case is a prime example of how foreign investors are granted greater rights than domestic firms. The NAFTA panel in the Loewen case issued a remarkable jurisdictional ruling indicating that all adverse domestic court decisions are potentially eligible for NAFTA review as international law violations and may even qualify as “expropriations.” This ruling implicates court decisions at every level, even potentially those of the U.S. Supreme Court. In contrast, U.S. firms operating in the United States do not have this second bite at the apple outside of the domestic court system and cannot bring regulatory takings cases based upon domestic court rulings. The case in question involved the Loewen Group, a giant Canadian funeral conglomerate, which had been aggressively acquiring small funeral homes across America. Loewen attempted to use NAFTA’s foreign investor protections to “reverse” a multimillion-dollar Mississippi jury’s ruling in favor of a small funeral home operator who sued the conglomerate for breach of contract and assorted fraudulent acts. Even though the NAFTA tribunal dismissed Loewen’s underlying claims on technical grounds (primarily due to the fact that the bankrupt Loewen corporation had reincorporated as a U.S. firm and thus no longer qualified as a foreign investor), a very different result may have occurred had the firm reincorporated in Canada. First, the NAFTA panel in this case, determined that under NAFTA’s terms a jury ruling in a civil contract case qualified as a “government action” against which foreign investors were granted special NAFTA protections. Attorneys representing the United States had argued that specific policies or actions of the government affecting a foreign investor – not the every day function of a domestic court – was what NAFTA’s reference to government “measures” covered. The panel’s decision further focused on the reference to international law in NAFTA’s provisions guaranteeing a minimum standard of treatment for foreign investors, noting that when the conduct of a domestic court does not meet such an international law standard, a NAFTA violation could be found. Remarkably, the panel failed to place any limits on the type of domestic court decision that can be challenged using the investor-state mechanism, except to state that plaintiffs should exhaust domestic court remedies before proceeding to a NAFTA tribunal. Thus, it is no surprise that the Loewen tribunal decision was greeted with great concern in U.S. legal circles. The Conference of Chief Justices (representing Chief Justices from state supreme courts) promptly passed a resolution calling upon the Bush administration to keep court rulings out of trade tribunals. The U.S. Conference of Mayors had earlier issued the same call, yet CAFTA fails to prevent domestic court rulings from being reheard in unaccountable investor-state tribunals.
First, the U.S. and China need to start actively cooperating together on global challenges where we have mutual interests. In the past, our countries have focused on bilateral issues. Today, however, the major challenges and opportunities for the U.S.-China relationship will come in working together to address critical global challenges such as nuclear proliferation, energy and food security, terrorism, climate change, Middle East instability, cyber security, and global financial reform and recovery.¶ The need to find tangible ways to work together constructively on global challenges was evident at Sunnylands. Obama and Xi concluded their discussions with an announcement to enhance cooperation on combating nuclear proliferation by continuing to apply pressure on Pyongyang, and to work together to combat climate change by discussing ways to reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbons. If we can engage in more effort together that produce real benefits for our peoples as well as the rest of the world, this will be an important step toward making the new model of major country relations a reality.¶ Second, Chinese and American leaders will need to resist the expectation that either side will change the other side’s views on long-standing and historical areas of disagreement between our two countries—such as Taiwan or human rights— overnight. Many in Washington are concerned that the new model of great power relations concept is an effort by China to compel the U.S. to respect China’s core interests, create Chinese spheres of influence, and get the U.S. to accommodate China's interests on Beijing’s terms. This type of approach will not work, and making this a starting point for discussions on the new paradigm will only set this exercise up for failure. On many of these issues, including Taiwan, the United States and China have agreed to disagree since their first communiqué in 1972. But in a more positive context of greater cooperation on global issues, our leaders will be in a better place to work on and reduce these areas of long-standing disagreement. ¶ Third, our countries have new areas of tensions in the relationship that exacerbate mistrust and that we need to address with urgency. In 2013, these issues included revelations of Chinese cyber hacking of American commercial and military secrets to dangerous risks deriving from regional territorial disputes in the South and East China Sea, including Beijing’s recent announcement of a new Air Defense Identification Zone. These challenges, especially the latter, hold the potential for confrontation between our militaries if we do not renew our military to military efforts to increase transparency and cooperation. These important issues must be addressed head-on, not sidestepped. But as we work vigorously through these current disagreements, we should not allow these areas of friction to define or overwhelm our broad and robust relationship. But we must address them with urgency and find ways to reduce these disagreements and enhance trust if we are to achieve a new type of major country relations.
The Gulf’s one avowedly anti-American government, Iran, is obviously not— as Moscow well knows—willing or able to turn to the US for support against Russia. But it does mean that Tehran is constantly wary of Russia, as the negative Iranian Foreign Ministry reaction to Putin’s May 2018 call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Syria demonstrated.57 Ironically, the Trump Administration’s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear accord which has caused a rift between the US and its European allies may create an opportunity for Iran to cooperate with Europe,58 which could reduce Iranian dependence on Moscow. And all governments in the region want to cooperate with China. For even if, as is likely, Beijing also seeks to avoid choosing sides between the region’s rivals but cooperate with them all, China offers one significant advantage over Russia: China buys oil from the region while Russia competes with the countries there in selling it. And with its much larger economy, China’s influence in the region could well dwarf Russia’s if and when Beijing chooses to exercise it—especially considering Russia’s own economic dependence on China.
Many of us who follow drug and medical device development and their regulation have seen this coming. Bringing a new drug to market now requires 12 to 15 years and costs more than $1.4 billion, and the number of drugs approved by the FDA annually is trending downward (in spite of years of significant increases in the agency's budget). Consider the numbers of approvals during recent five-year intervals. From 2007 to 2011, the FDA approved 123 new drugs; from 2002 to 2006, 129 drugs; and from 1997 to 2001, 178 drugs. That trend is destined to continue because in 2010 the number of applications for approval of new drugs was the lowest in decades. Another metric that reflects what the drug companies are experiencing is the plummeting success rate of Phase 2 clinical trials, in which the efficacy of a new drug candidate begins to be assessed; from 28 percent in 2006-2007, it fell to 18 percent in 2008-2010, according to an analysis published in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery last May. Facing regulatory uncertainty or obstructionism, companies are simply abandoning projects that in a more positive regulatory environment might have yielded medically useful, profitable products. This lowers the probability that an American research-intensive company will come up with The Next Big Thing, for either its initial indication or subsequent ones. But perhaps the most ominous statistic of all is that drug manufacturers recoup their R&D costs for only one in five approved drugs, a deterioration from one in four about a decade ago. Is it any surprise that potential investors are disenchanted? The current sorry state of pharmaceutical development reflects the FDA's excessive risk aversion, unchecked by congressional oversight, which has forced companies to perform ever-larger, longer, more complex, and more expensive clinical trials. Expressing industry's frustration at the FDA's capriciousness and intransigence, Fred Hassan, then CEO of drug company Schering-Plough, said of the regulatory climate: "What will it take to get new drugs approved? The point is, we don't know." Kenneth Kaitin, director of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, described the obstructionist culture at the FDA as having caused it to become viewed as "an agency that is supposed to keep unsafe drugs off the market, not to speed access to life-saving drugs." Illustrating the kind of policy-making that has frustrated corporate innovators, regulators have concocted additional criteria for granting marketing approval of a drug. The new criteria are above and beyond the statutory requirement for the demonstration of safety and efficacy and could inflict significant damage on both patients and pharmaceutical companies: Seemingly arbitrarily, the FDA sometimes requires that new drugs be not merely effective but actually superior to existing therapies, a new standard that is often difficult and extremely costly to meet. For example, although the law requires that to be marketed a drug must simply be shown to be safe and effective, the agency denied approval of Merck's Arcoxia, a COX-2 enzyme inhibitor for the relief of arthritis pain, because the drug needed to be shown to be superior to existing drugs. Robert Meyer, director of the FDA office that oversees arthritis drugs, claimed that the agency's advisory committee had sent a clear message that "simply having another drug on the market . . . didn't seem to be sufficient reason" for approval. But whether or not the advisory committee meant to convey that (and in any case, advisory committee recommendations are not binding), it is specious reasoning—and it epitomizes the flawed, anti-innovation decision-making that prevails at FDA and other regulatory agencies. For several reasons, it may be important to have “another drug on the market" even if it appears from clinical trials data to be no better than the alternatives. First, there are often critical differences between drugs that act through similar mechanisms: Different COX-2 inhibitors and statins, for example, were shown long after the initial approvals to have distinct advantages and disadvantages; depending on a variety of factors, physicians can select one over another. Second, if two drugs are each effective for 40 percent of patients with a given symptom or disease, it may not be clear whether they work for the same 40 percent. Thus, if the drugs are effective in different patient populations, the failure of regulators to approve the second drug could deprive a large number of patients of access to an efficacious drug. At best, practitioners and patients would have fewer choices. Third, a 2006 study by M.I.T. economist Ernst Berndt and his collaborators found that "supplemental," or secondary, approvals of drugs—which include new dosages, formulations, and indications—accounted for substantial use and public health benefits of the drugs. If the drug is not approved because the initial studies do not show superiority to comparators, these later benefits are lost. Finally, in a study published last year, Joseph DiMasi and Laura Faden of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development persuasively debunked the myth that drug companies purposely produce duplicative me-too drugs. They carefully examined drug development patterns and timing and found that the process is best viewed as "a race in which several firms pursue investigational drugs with similar chemical structures or with the same mechanism of action before any drug in the class obtains regulatory marketing approval." In other words, companies are not starting out to develop a me-too product any more than a marathon runner starts a race intending to be an also-ran. DiMasi and Faden concluded that "the distinctions that are often drawn between the relative innovative value of the development of the first-in-class and the me-too drugs in the same class may be misguided." Other Regulatory Overkill Regulatory excesses harm more than just industries and individual companies. The diversion of resources to comply with regulation (useful or not) exerts an “income effect” that shows a correlation between wealth and health, an issue popularized by the late political scientist Aaron Wildavsky. It is no coincidence, he argued, that richer societies have lower mortality rates than poorer ones. To deprive communities of wealth, therefore, is to enhance their health risks. Wildavsky's argument is correct: Wealthier individuals are able to purchase better healthcare, enjoy more nutritious diets, and lead generally less stressful lives. Conversely, the deprivation of income itself has adverse health effects—for example, an increased incidence of stress-related problems including ulcers, hypertension, heart attacks, depression, and suicides. It is difficult to quantify precisely the relationship between mortality and the deprivation of income, but academic studies suggest as a conservative estimate that every $7.25 million of regulatory costs will induce one additional fatality through this “income effect.” The excess costs in the tens of billions of dollars required annually by excessively precautionary regulation for various classes of consumer products would, therefore, be expected to cause thousands of deaths per year. These are the real costs of regulators running amok in the guise of “erring on the side of safety.” The expression “regulatory overkill” is not merely a figure of speech. Not only have we experienced several years of slow economic growth and job creation but for the third year in a row, the United States has slipped in the World Economic Forum's (WEF) annual competitiveness survey. Obama has too often advanced policies that inhibit innovation, discourage R&D, blunt wealth creation, and kill jobs. If the president were serious about regulatory reform to boost the economic recovery, he would clean house and replace political appointees at the gatekeeper agencies which approve products such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and genetically engineered plant varieties.
EL PASO – An expected doubling of the populations of Cd. Juárez and El Paso by 2035 would cause dramatic delays at the border bridges resulting in a threat to business in both cities instead of providing larger markets. By 2035 the combined population of both cities is expected to reach 3.4 million, compared to 1.1 million in 1980 and nearly 2 million today. According to a study by the Texas Department of Transportation, the continuous population growth will cause wait times on international bridges to increase from two hours today to almost four hours 25 years from now. The extended wait times will provoke a negative effect in El Paso-Juárez business, said Dr. Gary Hedrick, assistant professor of finance at the University of Texas at El Paso. “Businesses in the area have [already] been affected, but neither the government nor the people have realized the threat,” Hedrick said. The transportation department’s study reveals that the international ports of entry would reach their maximum operational capacity by 2035. The study by TXDOT predicts a loss of $54 billion for business on both sides of the border. (José Luis Trejo/Borderzine.com) The study by TXDOT predicts a loss of $54 billion for business on both sides of the border. (José Luis Trejo/Borderzine.com) The Puente Internacional de las Americas would be the most affected port of entry. Some of the effects, according to the study, will be the loss of more than $54 billion and 850,000 jobs along both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, primarily related to the import-export of goods. Competitiveness between businesses would also be affected. “We need to consider this as an increasing partnership,” said Richard Dayoub, President and CEO of the Greater El Paso Chamber of Commerce. “This is an ongoing problem that started 30 years ago,” said Dayoub. He said that El Paso representatives in the U.S. Congress have not evaluated the importance of this problem to the import and export of goods with Mexico, as well as billions of dollars’ worth of revenue to the United States. “They [representatives] need to try to understand how critical the El Paso economy is to our country – over $70 billion dollars were involved in commercial trade alone in this border in 2010, plus an average of 2,376 jobs per billion dollars worth of exports,” he said.
A Moment of Opportunity Since the 9/11 attacks, the foreign policy focus of the United States has been directed away from regional concerns towards problems outside the Western Hemisphere. Latin America has been virtually ignored by recent presidential administrations, and the problem is becoming chronic. While Columbia gets some attention, relations with our neighbor and number two trading partner to the south wither. What of U.S. – Mexican relations? What hope is there for progress on critical issues of concern, and what can be achieved by President Obama? This article, based on recent research by Valeriano and Powers (2010) on American and Mexican public perceptions, explains why now is the time to deal with the significant and pressing problems that occupy U.S. foreign relations with Mexico. Because public views in both countries are converging in the realms of terrorism, drug trafficking, and immigration, the moment is ripe to deal with these issues. The shift towards democracy, openness, and public consultation on pressing issues within Mexico suggests a moment of opportunity for the Obama administration to engage it. Since this convergence may only be temporary, failure to engage Mexico immediately will prevent the resolution of these pressing issues while engendering anger and continued frustration because the United States continues to ignore the maintenance of an important international relationship. This article concludes by suggesting some of the policy options open to the Obama administration. The State of Public Perceptions Despite disagreements over a few major issues like NAFTA and Iraq that have soured bilateral relations, there is significant agreement between the publics of Mexico and the United States over several other important areas. Public views in both countries converge around the issues of immigration, terrorism, and drug trafficking. In fact the public and elites in Mexico are more concerned with terrorism and drug trafficking than are the public and elites in the United States. People in both the United States and Mexico are optimistic that the issues of immigration, terrorism, and drug trafficking can be solved if proper attention is focused on solutions and international coordination. Recognizing the linkages among these issues and mobilizing this mutual support will be critical to resolving these outstanding foreign policy problems. Perhaps the most important issue is terrorism. Obviously, for the United States terrorism has been a critical problem since 9/11. The major focus of U.S. foreign policy has been to tackle this problem in the Middle East, yet it should equally look in its own backyard for solutions to security problems. If the United States is going to achieve domestic security, it must first achieve secure borders. Achieving secure borders does not mean simply building walls to keep out Hispanic immigrants. It means strengthening screening processes at both borders, fixing port security, and remaining vigilant to the threat that comes through air traffic. While no terrorists have yet crossed through the southern border, it is still critical to ensure security at all points of entry. The Mexican and American publics hold similar and stable views regarding terrorism. Both groups view terrorism as a critical threat at levels of 70 to 80 percent. The high level of concern among the Mexican public might be surprising, but one must consider they are neighbors to the biggest terrorist target in the world and have experienced their own incidents of domestic terrorism. Since both publics view the issue as critical, it seems prudent that both states work together towards intelligence sharing and stable borders.
Overfishing impacts not just the particular species that is exploited, but also damages other species of fish and disrupts local ecosystems. The stability of ecological communities depends largely on the interactions between predators and prey (12). Thereby, the balance of the food chain is disturbed when certain species are removed. As a result, many ocean species are disappearing and losing their habitats. The evolutionary process of marine species is also being altered, causing cycles of premature reproduction and relative decreases in the size of fish across generations. As predators diminish, the populations of smaller fish escalate because they were previously the food source of the bigger fish. In addition, the disappearance of these species affects many other species, like seabirds and sea mammals, which are vulnerable to the lack of food (2). A recent study found that overfishing is also decreasing the genetic diversity of fish worldwide. Diversity is projected to be reduced further if overfishing continues at the same rate (13). This has serious effects on nutrient recycling in marine ecosystems because fish species vary widely in their rates of nitrogen and phosphorus excretion. As such, altering fish communities creates divergent nutrient recycling patterns and disrupts the functioning of the ecosystem. Recently conducted studies in lakes affected by overfishing show that loss of species contributes to a decline in nutrient recycling and destabilizes the ecosystem (14).
Perhaps the most common argument to appear which counters the consensus AGW viewpoint is that the Earth is not warming. While recently this viewpoint has been associated with incorrect notion that the Earth surface has not, for example, warmed in the past 15 years Bloomberg, 2013; New York Times, 2013), it often is conflated with the concept that global warming has stopped. This, too, is false, as evident by measurements reported in numerous articles, such as Nuccitelli et al. (2012), Abraham et al. (2013), and Trenberth and Fasullo (2014). The foundation for many of the claims that the Earth has ceased or even slowed its warming is based on a selective assessment of small portions of the Earth system rather than the Earth as a whole.¶ However, the notion that parts of the Earth system which should warm with AGW are not warming perhaps had a genesis in the early 1990s when satellite temperature measurements became commonplace. Traditionally, Earth temperatures are measured by land-based temperature sensors; balloon sensors (radiosondes); temperature sensors on ships, buoys, or other ocean-going craft; and other instruments. Each of the different temperature- measuring methodologies suffers from limitations of geographical coverage and measurement accuracy. With the advancement of satellite measuring methodologies, it became possible to achieve near global coverage using microwave radiometers. The radiometers relate emission of atmospheric oxygen to temperatures throughout the atmosphere. With continuous and long-term records, it was possible to make longitudinal studies of the rate of temperature change in the troposphere and the stratosphere. A number of papers appeared in the early 1990s describing the methodology, accuracy, and findings (e.g. Spencer and Christy, 1990; Spencer and Christy 1993; Christy and Goodridge, 1995; Christy, et al., 1995; Christy and Spencer, 1995; Spencer, et al., 1996). Among the early findings was the surprising conclusion that the lower atmosphere of the Earth was cooling, in direct contradiction to the consensus AGW view.¶ Despite claims of accuracy from the authors, other researchers began to question the results (Hansen and Wilson, 1993; Schneider 1994; Hurrell and Trenberth, 1997; Hurrell and Trenberth, 1998; Wentz and Schabel, 1998) with many questions raised regarding the purported accuracy of the satellite measurements. Among the issues of concern were errors associated with merging satellite records, orbital decay of satellites as their altitude decreased over time, errors of on-board temperature calibration measurement systems, and drift in the time of observation and thus aliasing of the diurnal cycle.¶ The original authors defended the work in the scientific literature (Christy et al., 1997) and often pointed to comparisons of their measurements with weather balloon data (radiosondes) (e.g., Spencer and Christy, 1993; Christy and Spencer, 1995; Christy et al., 1998; Christy et al., 2000) as validation of the satellites. Meanwhile, as corrections were made to the methodology and new data were obtained, the original conclusions of a cooling troposphere were modified to show warming.¶ In the ensuing years, the critiques of the satellite records continued (Mears, et al., 2003; Mears and Wentz, 2005), which most notably identified an error in the diurnal correction of satellite drift (changes to the satellite orbit), an error acknowledged by the originators (Christy and Spencer, 2005). The argument that comparisons with radiosonde data validated the satellite measurements was questioned when it was found that solar heating of the instruments or changes to instrumentation introduced errors in the measured temperatures (Sherwood et al., 2005; Randel and Wu, 2006). The accuracy of radiosonde temperature measurements and their utility in calibrating satellite data is still being dealt with in the literature (e.g., Thorne et al., 2005; Lanzante and Free, 2008; Allen and Sherwood, 2008; Santer et al., 2008; Titchner et al., 2009; Thorne et al., 2011;).¶ One other source of error has long been identified but still not fully quantified. It is the bias associated with the measurement instruments themselves on board the satellites. In particular, a warm calibration target is needed to relate the microwave emissions to atmospheric temperatures. When corrected, the trend in the middle part of the troposphere is found to be significantly greater than previously disclosed (Po-Chedley and Fu, 2012). This latest correction represents the still unsettled yet strongly rebutted satellite temperature trends and early claims of atmospheric cooling.¶ The result of this two-decade investigation is that the previously reported cooling of the atmosphere was based on faulty technique and equipment. In the ensuing years, various improvements have been made, and currently there is better agreement between different research teams measuring temperature trends in the lower and upper layers of the atmosphere. All data now shows that the lower atmosphere is heating (as expected) while the upper atmosphere is undergoing a long-term cooling trend (also as expected) because of increased emissions of greenhouse gases. This spatial behavior is a strong indicator that the temperature increases of the Earth’s surface over the past 40 years is caused by greenhouse gas emissions (rather than by other causes such as increased solar activity). The evolution in estimated lower tropospheric temperature trends are shown in Figure 1.
Weather disruptions at home and weak demand abroad caused a contraction of rare severity in the U.S. economy in the first quarter, renewing doubts about the strength of the nation's five-year-old recovery. The U.S. economy in the first quarter saw its sharpest pullback since the recession ended nearly five years ago. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, fell at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.9% in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said in its third reading of the data Wednesday. That was a sharp downward revision from the previous estimate that output fell at an annual rate of 1%. It also represented the fastest rate of decline since the recession, and was the largest drop recorded since the end of World War II that wasn't part of a recession. To be sure, many signs since March, including reports of growth in consumer spending, business investment and hiring, indicate the first quarter doesn't mark the start of a new recession. And revisions in future years could alter the first-quarter figure. J.P. Morgan Chase economist Michael Feroli described the decline as "mostly a confluence of several negative, but mostly one-off, factors." But the severity of the drop, he said, "calls into question how much vigor there is in the pace of activity" going forward. One factor in the government's revision of first-quarter output was difficulty in estimating the impact of the Affordable Care Act on health-care expenditures. Actual health spending came in substantially lower than expected based on ACA enrollments and Medicaid data, declining at a 1.4% annualized pace in the period compared with an earlier estimate of a 9.1% increase. Beyond that, consumer spending on goods, business outlays on equipment and housing investment were all soft, a weakness that economists have attributed, at least in part, to unusually harsh winter weather. Overall consumer spending on goods and services, which accounts for more than two thirds of economic output, increased at an annual rate of 1%, off from the earlier estimate of 3.1% growth. The Commerce report showed businesses sharply drawing down inventories in the first quarter after building them up to levels deemed unsustainable by economists late last year. The move subtracted 1.7 percentage points from growth. Exports in the period fell by nearly 10%, a new sign of a challenging global economic environment. The European recovery remains anemic, while growth in fast-expanding emerging markets such as China and Brazil has downshifted. The severity of the first-quarter downturn is at odds with other data showing greater strength in the economy, especially a recent pickup in job creation. Since World War II, there have been 15 other quarters during which GDP contracted by this amount or more. In 14 of those 15 quarters, hiring contracted along with output. Meanwhile, early data from the second quarter indicate the economy has improved this spring, as warmer weather has helped release pent-up demand. Sales of new homes surged to a six-year high last month, while existing-home sales rose to their highest level since October, data released earlier this week showed. "Things are looking very strong here in Naples," said Anthony Solomon, owner of The Ronto Group, a land developer in Naples, Fla. "In all our communities, we're seeing great appetite from home builders and from end buyers." Still, the depth of the first-quarter decline in output means growth during the first half of the year likely will fall below the economy's average rate of just over 2% since it emerged from recession in June 2009. That is below the longer-term growth rate, during recent decades, of slightly more than 3%. "It does not sound like the economy has reached escape velocity no matter how you try to spin it," said Chris Rupkey, an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. For economic output to ratchet up to a healthier long-term trend, economists say consumer spending must rise to its prerecession pace of about 3% growth. But five years into the recovery, high unemployment and stagnant incomes continue to restrain the American consumer. "We just don't see consumer spending coming back to the levels that they were before," Virginia McDowell, chief executive of Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc., recently told investors at a presentation of the company's fourth-quarter earnings. "We continue to get pressured on the top line because our consumer spending habits have changed," Ms. McDowell said.
Conventional policy studies represent the master's tool in that they are primarily a mechanism for powerholders to find cost effective ways to pursue their goals (Ball, 1990; Scheurich, 1994). To discern the master's tools we need to deconstruct the concepts, problems, subjects and interpretations that formulate policy studies. For even though gender may appear to be absent or irrelevant, ultimately the decisions that emerge from such studies do have gendered consequences. As has been pointed out, 'the notion of androcentrism suggests that assumptions, concepts, beliefs, arguments, theories, methods, laws, policies and institutions may all be "gendered"' (Hawkesworth, 1994: 105).
In recent years in the United States, constitutional reasoning and practice has been going global. For many, this trend became apparent for the first time when, in the course of its analysis in the recent affirmative action and gay rights cases, the U.S. Supreme Court made frank references to foreign practices, public opinion, and court decisions, as well as international agreements-those ratified by the United States and those not.' While, strictly speaking, not unprecedented, the Court's transnational references in these cases were notable for a number of reasons. First, because they took place in decisions not involving international affairs, as traditionally defined, but rather in cases involving domestic policy issues that are at the heart of partisan political contention, they were unusually prominent. Second, rather than amounting to casual allusions, they represent a calculated step by key justices on the Court--led by Justice Breyer, but also joined by Justices Ginsburg, Kennedy, and O'Connor-to bring the Court's approach toward constitutional interpretation into line with new approaches being taken by justices in the courts of other countries.2 And third, these efforts in the American judiciary are taking place in a distinctive reformist intellectual context in which many scholars and activists, both in the United States and around the world, are coming to understand legal transnationalism as an imperative.' As is evident from even the most casual perusal of the increasingly high profile journals of international law, scholars are now hard at work trying out alternative doctrines, seeking those that will be least politically vulnerable. Debates involving the applicability of the law of nations, customary international law, treaties, international agreements and pronouncements, and foreign practices, precedents, judicial reasoning (under the guise of "constitutional borrowing"), and public opinion to the decisionmaking processes of American judges deciding domestic constitutional cases, more and more are filling pages of these law journals. These calculated efforts to transform the way in which the Court considers domestic constitutional issues may very well mark the beginning of a major departure in the direction of American constitutional law.
The purpose of this paper is to examine how inclusive education reform is appropriated in schools where New Capitalism work practices dominate the discourse of school improvement. We seek to understand the interplay between New Capitalism work practices, inclusive education, and professional practices of teachers and administrators. We argue that agendas to design inclusive, supportive learning environments that promote broad and multiple forms of diversity compete and collide with reforms based on a neoliberal agenda (i.e., accountability, flexibility, and choice). These collisions have the potential to disrupt the curricular and pedagogical practices of school professionals committed to pursuing an equity agenda in schools. Without careful attention to how certain practices interact and are altered over time, New Capitalism can appropriate inclusive education as an ideological tool saturated with shallow sentiments that lead to little or no substantive improvements in educational access and outcomes for diverse and underserved students. We use New Capitalism in this paper to mean the dominance of efficiency, standardization, and micro-segmentation of profit taking (e.g., parsing the time that educators spend with particular students by role) at the expense of local, place-specific knowledge and innovation (Sennett, 2006; Sennett, 1997). New Capitalism arises from the ideologies of neoliberalism based on privatization, a reliance on “free” markets, deregulation, the reemergence of the dominance of private investment in controlling labor, and the transnational transfer of goods and services. As Stiglitz (2012) argues, free markets without the restraint of government concentrate power in the ultra rich and destabilize professional expertise by capitalizing micro aspects of practice so that professionals and laborers alike are paid for piecework. As Apple (2007) wrote, “the movement toward marketization and choice requires the production of standardized data based on standardized processes and products so that comparisons can be made and so that consumers have relevant information to make choices” (p. 111). The interplay between New Capitalism and inclusive education reform has been explained from a conceptual and anecdotal point of view, aided by quantitative and policy analyses (e.g., Graham & Jahnukainen, 2011; Liasidou, 2008; Slee, 2011). Less attention has been paid to how New Capitalism work practices shape school professionals’ understanding and implementation of an inclusive education agenda, their relationships with colleagues and their own work, as well as their understandings of students who struggle to learn. This paper addresses these knowledge gaps by examining the case of an urban school that partnered with a university teacher education program to work towards inclusive education. In particular, we examine the impact of one New Capitalism technology, i.e., performativity and its associated auditing practices and artifacts, on teachers’ professional visions for inclusive education in one school. In the followings sections, we outline a definition of inclusive education, discuss the emergence of New Capitalism work practices in education, and theorize inclusive education as a situated practice. Then, we turn to describe our methods of inquiry and present our findings 1 This paper is part of a dissertation mentored by Dr. Alfredo J. Artiles.

Education Policy Analysis Archives Vol. 23 No. 37 4 Outlining an Inclusive Education Agenda Inclusive education has been a global movement in response to the systemic exclusion of those considered different from the dominant culture of schools (e.g., racial, language, religious, and ethnic minorities, females, students with disabilities, and students from low-income backgrounds). Being different is highly consequential as it has historically been associated with deviance, deficit and exclusion (Erevelles, 2011). Since the Salamanca Statement on Principles, Policy and Practice in Special Needs Education (UNESCO, 1994), inclusive education has become a buzzword with multiple meanings (Thomas & O’Hanlon, 2005). As Peter Clough stated, inclusive education “is not a single movement. It is made up of many strong currents of belief, many different local struggles and a myriad forms of practice” (Clough, 2000, p. 6). The wide range of definitions and interpretations of inclusive education is largely due to how this movement is interpreted and implemented in culturally, politically, and socially charged contexts (Artiles, Kozleski, & Waitoller, 2011). For instance, while in the U.S. inclusive education has been defined as access to the general education curriculum for students with disabilities, within the international community it has had a broader equity agenda for all marginalized students (Artiles & Dyson, 2005). Furthermore, definitions of inclusive education have ranged from assimilationist approaches to more transformative ones that aim to question, critique and change the normative parameters of the dominant culture of the schools (Artiles, Harris-Murri, & Rostenberg, 2006). In addition, conceptualizations of inclusive education have been criticized for their minimal attention to the complexities of intersecting forms of exclusion and the role of culture and geography in producing ever-changing margins and peripheries (Artiles & Kozleski, 2007; Waitoller & Artiles, 2013; Slee, 2011). Exclusion emerges through the interaction of multiple factors (Crenshaw, 1991). The braid of ability, race/ethnicity, gender, language, and social class differences has been largely documented, and it has negatively affected students from ethnic and linguistic minorities (Artiles, 2011). These students tend to experience intersecting forms of exclusion (Crenshaw, 1991; Erevelles & Minear, 2010). For instance, the overrepresentation of ethnic and linguistic minorities in special education has been documented in various countries such as Australia (Sweller, Graham, & Van Bergen, 2012), Austria (Luciak & Biewer, 2011), Germany (Löser & Werning, 2011), England (Dyson & Kozleski, 2008), and the U.S. (Office of Special Education Programs, 2011). Furthermore, in the U.S., students from ethnic and linguistic minorities (i.e., African Americans, Latinos, and English Language Learners) receiving special education services are more likely to be placed in more segregated settings (Fierros & Conroy, 2002; Sullivan, 2011), are more likely to be suspended from school (Skiba, Poloni-Staudinger, Gallini, Simmons, & FeggingsAzziz, 2006), and are less likely to enroll in a four-year college than White students receiving special education (Wagner, Newman, Cameto, & Levine, 2006). An inclusive education agenda that only focuses on one form of difference (e.g., being Latino or a student with disabilities) will not be able to fully to address the complex needs of students who embody multiple forms of difference (Waitoller & Kozleski, 2013).
. An event of cosmic proportions occurred on November 18 when the US congress passed the Space Act of 2015 into law. The legislation will give US space firms the rights to own and sell natural resources they mine from bodies in space, including asteroids. Although the act, passed with bipartisan support, still requires President Obama's signature, it is already the most significant salvo that has been fired in the ideological battle over ownership of the cosmos. It goes against a number of treaties and international customary law which already apply to the entire universe. The new law is nothing but a classic rendition of the "he who dares wins" philosophy of the Wild West. The act will also allow the private sector to make space innovations without regulatory oversight during an eight-year period and protect spaceflight participants from financial ruin. Surely, this will see private firms begin to incorporate the mining of asteroids into their investment plans. Supporters argue that the US Space Act is a bold statement that finally sets private spaceflight free from the heavy regulation of the US government. The misdiagnosis begins here. Space exploration is a universal activity and therefore requires international regulation. The act represents a full-frontal attack on settled principles of space law which are based on two basic principles: the right of states to scientific exploration of outer space and its celestial bodies and the prevention of unilateral and unbriddled commercial exploitation of outer-space resources. These principles are found in agreements including the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and the Moon Agreement of 1979. The US House Committee on Science, Space and Technology denies there is anything in the act which violates the US's international obligations. According to this body, the right to extract and use resources from celestial bodies "is affirmed by State practice and by the US State Department in Congressional testimony and written correspondence". Crucially, there is no specific reference to international law in this statement. Simply relying on US legislation and policy statements to justify the plans is obviously insufficient. So what's at stake? We can assume that the list of states that have access to outer space – currently a dozen or so – will grow. These states may also shortly respond with mining programmes of their own. That means that the pristine conditions of the cradle of nature from which our own Earth was born may become irrevocably altered forever – making it harder to trace how we came into being. Similarly, if we started contaminating celestial bodies with microbes from Earth, it could ruin our chances of ever finding alien life there. Mining minerals in space could also damage the environment around the Earth and eventually lead to conflict over resources. Indeed what right has the second highest polluter of the Earth's environment got to proceed with some of the same corporations in a bid to plunder outer space? Ultimately, the US plans must be understood in the light of existing rules of space law. Money is not a dirty word in space – the total value of the satellite telecommunications industry in 2013 was more than $195bn. Free market principles also apply to the operations of the International Space Station. So, let's get down to the nitty-gritty. Currently corporations can exploit outer space in a number of ways, including for space tourism and scientific training. Companies may also be allowed to extract certain resources, but the very first provision of the Outer Space Treaty (1967), to which the US is a signatory, is that such exploration and use shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries. This therefore prevents the sale of space-based minerals for profit. The treaty also states that outer space shall be the "province of all mankind … and that states shall avoid harmful contamination of space". Meanwhile, the Moon Agreement (1979) has in effect forbidden states to conduct commercial mining on planets and asteroids until there is an international regime for such exploitation. While the US has refused to sign up to this, it is binding as customary international law. The idea that American companies can on the basis of domestic laws alone systematically exploit mineral resources in space, despite huge environmental risks, really amounts to the audacity of greed. The Romans had this all correctly figured out in their legal maxim: "What concerns all must be decided upon by all."
Although there were questions from the beginning about whether the United States would hold itself to the same high standards domestically that it holds others to internationally, 178 the American government has successfully built up a policy and programming agenda in the past few years based on promoting an open Internet. 179 These efforts include raising concerns over Internet repression in bilateral dialogues with countries such as Vietnam and China, 180 supporting initiatives including the Freedom Online Coalition, and providing over $120 million in funding for “groups working to advance Internet freedom – supporting counter-censorship and secure communications technology, digital safety training, and policy and research programs for people facing Internet repression.” 181 However, the legitimacy of these efforts has been thrown into question since the NSA disclosures began. “Trust has been the principal casualty in this unfortunate affair,” wrote Ben FitzGerald and Richard Butler in December 2013. “The American public, our nation’s allies, leading businesses and Internet users around the world are losing faith in the U.S. government’s role as the leading proponent of a free, open and integrated global Internet.” 182 Prior to the NSA revelations, the United States was already facing an increasingly challenging political climate as it promoted the Internet Freedom agenda in global Internet governance conversations. At the 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT), the U.S. and diverse group of other countries refused to sign the updated International Telecommunications Regulations based on concerns that the document pushed for greater governmental control of the Internet and would ultimately harm Internet Freedom. 183 Many observers noted that the split hardened the division between two opposing camps in the Internet governance debate: proponents of a status quo multistakeholder Internet governance model, like the United States, who argued that the existing system was the best way to preserve key online freedoms, and those seeking to disrupt or challenge that multistakeholder model for a variety of political and economic reasons, including governments like Russia and China pushing for greater national sovereignty over the Internet. 184 Many of the proposals for more governmental control over the network could be understood as attempts by authoritarian countries to more effectively monitor and censor their citizens, which allowed the U.S. to reasonably maintain some moral high ground as its delegates walked out of the treaty conference. 185 Although few stakeholders seemed particularly pleased by the outcome of the WCIT, reports indicate that by the middle of 2013 the tone had shifted in a more collaborative and positive direction following the meetings of the 2013 World Telecommunications/ICT Policy Forum (WTPF) and the World Summit on Information Society + 10 (WSIS+10) review. 186 However, the Internet governance conversation took a dramatic turn after the Snowden disclosures. The annual meeting of the Freedom Online Coalition occurred in Tunis in June 2013, just a few weeks after the initial leaks. Unsurprisingly, surveillance dominated the conference even though the agenda covered a wide range of topics from Internet access and affordability to cybersecurity. 187 Throughout the two-day event, representatives from civil society used the platform to confront and criticize governments about their monitoring practices. 188 NSA surveillance would continue to be the focus of international convenings on Internet Freedom and Internet governance for months to come, making civil society representatives and foreign governments far less willing to embrace the United States’ Internet Freedom agenda or to accept its defense of the multistakeholder model of Internet governance as a anything other than self-serving. “One can come up with all kinds of excuses for why US surveillance is not hypocrisy. For example, one might argue that US policies are more benevolent than those of many other regimes… And one might recognize that in several cases, some branches of government don’t know what other branches are doing… and therefore US policy is not so much hypocritical as it is inadvertently contradictory,” wrote Eli Dourado, a researcher from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in August 2013. “But the fact is that the NSA is galvanizing opposition to America’s internet freedom agenda.” 189 The scandal revived proposals from both Russia and Brazil for global management of technical standards and domain names, whether through the ITU or other avenues. Even developing countries, many of whom have traditionally aligned with the U.S. and prioritize access and affordability as top issues, “don’t want US assistance because they assume the equipment comes with a backdoor for the NSA. They are walking straight into the arms of Russia, China, and the ITU.” 190 Consequently, NSA surveillance has shifted the dynamics of the Internet governance debate in a potentially destabilizing manner. The Snowden revelations “have also been well-received by those who seek to discredit existing approaches to Internet governance,” wrote the Center for Democracy & Technology’s Matthew Shears. “There has been a long-running antipathy among a number of stakeholders to the United States government’s perceived control of the Internet and the dominance of US Internet companies. There has also been a long-running antipathy, particularly among some governments, to the distributed and open management of the Internet.” 191 Shears points out that evidence of the NSA’s wide-ranging capabilities has fueled general concerns about the current Internet governance system, bolstering the arguments of those calling for a new government-centric governance order. At the UN Human Rights Council in September 2013, the representative from Pakistan—speaking on behalf of Cuba, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Ecuador, Russia, Indonesia, Bolivia, Iran, and China—explicitly linked the revelations about surveillance programs to the need for reforming Internet governance processes and institutions to give governments a larger role. 192 Surveillance issues continued to dominate the conversation at the 2013 Internet Governance Forum in Bali as well, where “debates on child protection, education and infrastructure were overshadowed by widespread concerns from delegates who said the public’s trust in the internet was being undermined by reports of US and British government surveillance.” 193 Further complicating these conversations is the fact that several of the institutions that govern the technical functions of the Internet are either tied to the American government or are located in the United States. Internet governance scholar Milton Mueller has described how the reaction to the NSA disclosures has become entangled in an already contentious Internet governance landscape. Mueller argues that, in addition to revealing the scale and scope of state surveillance and the preeminent role of the United States and its partners, the NSA disclosures may push other states toward a more nationally partitioned Internet and “threaten… in a very fundamental way the claim that the US had a special status as neutral steward of Internet governance.” 194 These concerns were publicly voiced in October 2013 by the heads of a number of key organizations, including the President of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the chair of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), in the Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation. Their statement expressed “strong concern over the undermining of the trust and confidence of Internet users globally due to recent revelations of pervasive monitoring and surveillance” and “called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions, towards an environment in which all stakeholders, including 22 all governments, participate on an equal footing.” 195 In particular, the process of internationalizing ICANN—which has had a contractual relationship with the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Association (NTIA) since 1998—has progressed in recent months. 196
The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released this report to the President in January 2011. The introduction states,¶ "On May 22, 2010, President Barack Obama announced the creation of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling: an independent, nonpartisan entity, directed to provide a thorough analysis and impartial judgment. The President charged the Commission to determine the causes of the disaster, and to improve the country’s ability to respond to spills, and to recommend reforms to make offshore energy production safer. And the President said we were to follow the facts wherever they led.¶ This report is the result of an intense six-month effort to fulfill the President’s charge.¶ From the outset, the Commissioners have been determined to learn the essential¶ lessons so expensively revealed in the tragic loss of life at the Deepwater Horizon and the¶ severe damages that ensued. The Commission’s aim has been to provide the President,¶  policymakers, industry, and the American people a clear, accessible, accurate, and fair¶  account of the largest oil spill in U.S history: the context for the well itself, how the¶  explosion and spill happened, and how industry and government scrambled to respond¶  to an unprecedented emergency. This was our first obligation: determine what happened,¶ why it happened, and explain it to Americans everywhere.¶ As a result of our investigation, we conclude:¶ • The explosive loss of the Macondo well could have been prevented.¶ • The immediate causes of the Macondo well blowout can be traced to a series of¶ identifiable mistakes made by BP, Halliburton, and Transocean that reveal such¶ systematic failures in risk management that they place in doubt the safety culture of¶ the entire industry.¶ • Deepwater energy exploration and production, particularly at the frontiers of experience, involve risks for which neither industry nor government has been adequately prepared, but for which they can and must be prepared in the future. • To assure human safety and environmental protection, regulatory oversight of¶ leasing, energy exploration, and production require reforms even beyond those¶ significant reforms already initiated since the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Fundamental¶  reform will be needed in both the structure of those in charge of regulatory oversight¶  and their internal decisionmaking process to ensure their political autonomy,¶  technical expertise, and their full consideration of environmental protection concerns.¶ • Because regulatory oversight alone will not be sufficient to ensure adequate safety,¶  the oil and gas industry will need to take its own, unilateral steps to increase¶  dramatically safety throughout the industry, including self-policing mechanisms that¶  supplement governmental enforcement.¶ • The technology, laws and regulations, and practices for containing, responding to,¶ and cleaning up spills lag behind the real risks associated with deepwater drilling into¶ large, high-pressure reservoirs of oil and gas located far offshore and thousands of¶ feet below the ocean’s surface. Government must close the existing gap and industry¶ must support rather than resist that effort.¶ • Scientific understanding of environmental conditions in sensitive environments in¶  deep Gulf waters, along the region’s coastal habitats, and in areas proposed for more¶  drilling, such as the Arctic, is inadequate. The same is true of the human and natural¶ impacts of oil spills."

In the 100 days since President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Orders (EOs) regarding immigration enforcement priorities, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested more than 41,000 individuals who are either known or suspected of being in the country illegally. This reflects an increase of 37.6 percent over the same period in 2016. Between Jan. 22 and April 29, 2017, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) deportation officers administratively arrested 41,318 individuals on civil immigration charges. Between Jan. 24 and April 30, 2016, ERO arrested 30,028. “These statistics reflect President Trump’s commitment to enforce our immigration laws fairly and across the board. ICE agents and officers have been given clear direction to focus on threats to public safety and national security, which has resulted in a substantial increase in the arrest of convicted criminal aliens. However, when we encounter others who are in the country unlawfully, we will execute our sworn duty and enforce the law. As the data demonstrates, ICE continues to execute our mission professionally and in accordance with the law, and our communities will be much safer for it,” said ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan. Nearly 75 percent of those arrested during this period in 2017 are convicted criminals, with offenses ranging from homicide and assault to sexual abuse and drug-related charges. The arrest of aliens at-large in the community increased by more than 50 percent, from 8,381 last year to 12,766 arrests this year during the same period. The arrest of convicted criminal aliens climbed nearly 20 percent, from 25,786 last year to 30,473 this year. Violent crimes such as homicide, rape, kidnapping and assault accounted for more than 2,700 convictions. In total, since the President signed the EOs, ICE’s immigration enforcement activity has resulted in more than 400 arrests per day, including the capture of egregious and violent offenders, such as: The Feb. 16 arrest in New York City of an MS-13 gang member, Estivan Rafael Marques Velasquez, a Salvadoran national with a criminal history in the U.S. which includes reckless endangerment in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, and disorderly conduct. The March 9 arrest in DeKalb, Georgia, of Jose Mercedes Meza-Ignacio, 52, a citizen of Mexico residing in Atlanta, wanted on criminal charges for child molestation. The April 10 arrest in Dallas, Texas, of Juan Antonio Melchor Molina by the agency’s Dallas Fugitive Operations Team. Molina is the subject of a 2011 murder warrant issued by the Prosecutor General’s Office in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Mexican authorities allege that Molina shot and killed Jorge Alejandro De La Rosa at a wedding in 2008. The April 13 arrest in Denver, Colorado, of Jose Victor Bonilla-Melendez, one of ICE’s “Most Wanted Fugitives,” in Denver, Colorado, following a public tip. Bonilla-Melendez is also known as Anthony Garcia-Melendez, a citizen of Honduras whose criminal history includes felony convictions for assault causing serious bodily injury, sexual assault and unlawful re-entry after deportation. The April 26 arrest in Houston, Texas, of William Magana-Contreras, a Salvadoran MS-13 gang member wanted for aggravated homicide in his home country. While these data clearly reflect the fact that convicted criminals are an immigration enforcement priority, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly has made it clear that ICE will no longer exempt any class of individuals from removal proceedings if they are found to be in the country illegally. This is evident by the rise in non-criminal arrests over the same period, which increased from approximately 4,200 in 2016 to more than 10,800 in 2017. “All of those arrested will receive the due process afforded to them under the law. ICE will take action to remove individuals subject to a final order by a federal immigration judge. We are a nation of laws, and ignoring orders issued by federal judges undermines our constitutional government,” said Homan. This announcement follows a significant gang announcement made by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations last week in which 1,095 confirmed gang members and associates were arrested.
The forthcoming US Nuclear Posture Review should broaden the traditional focus of such policy reviews on deterrence requirements and include a thorough analysis of how US nuclear declaratory policy influences the likelihood of nuclear proliferation, the consequences of proliferation, and perceptions of the illegitimacy of nuclear terrorism. Such a broader frame of analysis leads to the conclusion that it would be in the US national interest to adopt a no-first-use declaratory policy, stating clearly that ‘the role of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear weapons use by other nuclear weapons states against the United States, our allies, and our armed forces, and to be able respond, with an appropriate range of second-strike nuclear retaliation options, if necessary, in the event that deterrence fails’.
Waste disposal has also become an issue of greater environmental significance in China. Indeed, Chinese have long alleged that China had become the dumping ground for the rest of the world. Watts describes the sad example of Guangdong Province's city of Guiyu, the "world's computer graveyard, ... [where] studies reveal ... the amount of lead in the blood of children ... is 50 percent higher than limits set by the US Centers for Disease Control." He notes, moreover, that "American companies often falsely claim to be recycling domestically while actually shipping e-waste to China." Shapiro observes that "China has already surpassed the United States in overall production of household garbage." She also notes that China has a new "NIMBY-ism of the middle class, which is often heralded as a form of environmental awakening." A major protest erupted in Hangzhou in May 2014 over a planned incinerator that involved dozens of injuries to police and protesters. The Chinese media has been surprisingly open in its coverage of this new environmental activism. In a country where mass activism has not been lauded since the Cultural Revolution, it is interesting to see an article, for example, in a prominent magazine celebrating the environmental activists in Qidong (near Shanghai), where a paper mill wastewater pipeline was suspended in July 2012. The article describes in detail the achievements of the so-called antipollution volunteers and also discusses the difficult dilemma of whether to dispose of industrial pollutants into the Yangtze River or alternatively into the ocean, where local fishermen were bound to be affected. But, as the article observes, "Actually, the practice of dumping in the ocean has been around for well over one hundred years." Ample evidence suggests that China's proximate marine environments have suffered intensive degradation from both excessive dumping and over-fishing. A 2011 Chinese study found that pollution was a significant reason that Bohai fish production is now just 20 percent of the level it was as recently as the 1980s.33 The available data reveal similarly near catastrophic declines in the Beibu Gulf (Gulf of Tonkin) 33 Nor is it clear that the stocks can be rebuilt, because a recent study from Guangdong shows that four of five critical species show no improvement under current fishing regulations.34 Another recent Chinese study is similarly pessimistic: "Fishing methods in thirty-two [Chinese] fishing ports [reveal] ... trawling intensity greatly exceeds the reproduction capacity of fishery resources, and the fishing yields are of low value and immaturity, subsistence fishing and commercial fishing show ... prominent contradictions, ... [but] mesh size ... and net mouths are getting bigger."3a As with dams and river pollution, and also air pollution, the potential for environmental crises, such as in the area of marine fisheries, to straddle across borders and have an impact on key international relationships is high. The opposite conclusion, however, also holds true: that international cooperation will be the key to coping with many of China's environmental problems. Moreover, as many environmentalists are concluding, the world has no choice but to work with China to mitigate the environmental impact of its rise.
India, located in South Asia, has a population of 1.2 billion people and is on its way to becoming the world’s most populous nation by 2030. However, the country still struggles with providing its growing population with access to quality healthcare, potable water, education and clean energy. The education sector in India, in particular, requires special attention, since so much of the nation’s personal and national development is based upon it. India, being a developing nation, has struggled in this area for a very long time. For instance, even in the late 1980s, between 30 and 40 million children of primary school age were out of school. Foreign aid to India, as a result, proves to be an effective investment in this arena, and there are many ways foreign aid has advanced education in India. One of the ways foreign aid has advanced education in India is by initiating projects that focus on improving the sector from its core. For instance, one of the three major goals of USAID’s Global Education Strategy is “improved reading skills for 100 million children in primary grades.” Focus on the children in primary grades is essential, as so much of a country’s future depends on it. For instance, according to the World Bank, “an increase of one standard deviation in student reading and math scores is associated with an increase of two percentage points in annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth.” In order to advance this target, USAID supports 10 initiatives in the country and partners with the government of India to “identify, support and scale early grade reading innovations developed in India.” Additionally, USAID focuses on improving the capacity of educators to improve pedagogy and teaching. For instance, the Teacher Innovation in Practice program works to positively impact the teaching practices of 14,657 teachers to improve early grade reading outcomes of more than 564,000 primary school children in the states of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in India. By developing teachers’ mindsets, building an enabling environment and improving pedagogical skills and knowledge, the main goal of this program is to reignite teacher motivation to drive better student learning outcomes. Other initiatives focus on improving the literacy rate in the country, which was as low as 19.3 percent shortly after independence in 1951. USAID, in partnership with Tata Trusts and the Center for microFinance, is leading an initiative called the Nurturing Early Literacy Project that aims to “shift the prevalent rote-based pedagogy in India to one that views the child as an active learner.” The project incorporates different approaches, including in-class sessions for teachers and equitable access to libraries for children, both in schools and communities. The aim of this project is to improve reading skills of more than 90,000 primary school children in the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Karnataka. India reportedly spends a mere 3 percent of its GDP on education, making foreign aid geared towards development in the educational sector crucial. Foreign aid has advanced education in India significantly over the years. For instance, the literacy rate increased to 65.4 percent in 2001, and currently sits at 74.04 percent. Hopefully, with continued support from foreign investments, India will be able to develop its education sector, thereby potentially boosting its economy and reducing poverty.
The United States plays a unique role in the global economy. I am thinking, for instance, of global trade—of which the U.S. accounts for 11 percent. The U.S. also represents 20 percent of global manufacturing value-added. I know that you recognize the potential of an even bigger market. Tom and others at the Chamber have often referred to 95 percent of your potential customers living “outside the U.S.” America’s global financial ties are even deeper. Foreign banks hold about $5½ trillion of U.S. assets, while American banks hold about $3 trillion of foreign claims. Meanwhile, close to half of the S&P500’s sales originate from foreign operations. These interconnections have great benefits for the United States. But they are not without risks—two-way risks—and we saw some of these play out during this crisis. We all remember, five years ago, how the collapse of one U.S. bank ushered in a harsh new reality across sectors, across countries, and across the world. As those tensions traveled across the Atlantic, for example, they exposed tensions in Europe. Considering that 20 percent of U.S. exports are destined for Europe, and that more than half of U.S. overseas assets are held in Europe, you clearly have a large stake in the recovery there. And yet, despite the risks, I know that you are also deeply aware of how much can be gained from engaging with the rest of the world. President Taft, who helped establish the Chamber, captured this when he said: “I am in favor of helping the prosperity of all countries because, when we are all prosperous, the trade with each becomes more valuable to the other.” What was true in President Taft’s day is even more true in today’s interconnected world: a strong U.S. economy and a strong global economy are two sides of the same coin.
China and the U.S. are amidst a global paradigm of financial interdependence. They are the primary and secondary economic actors in the world with great opportunity for international cooperation: China holds nearly 1.5 trillion dollars in U.S. Treasury bonds; China’s growth is due in some part to American investments and massive exports from China to America; American corporations reap benefits from the cheap labor force in China (Katz, 2014). One of the greatest opportunities is for China and America to share the policing of the global commons. America’s decreased reliance on foreign oil facilitates this option. China’s current naval strategy is regionally focused and based heavily on coastal defense; however, it is evolving into a global strategy facilitated by the expansion and protection of sea routes, an effort aimed at protecting its shipping (Saez, 2013). Diplomatically, the United States can leverage or compliment China’s growing role in securing the commons, perhaps establishing an increased Chinese role. Militarily, U.S. and Chinese navies, operating under a collaborative agreement, can develop a relationship to protect shared interests in maritime energy shipments, both in Asia and along supply routes bringing energy to Asia from Africa, Russia, and the Middle East. The U.S. Army is establishing a dialogue and an exchange program with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army and such engagements may extend to other branches of the military (Wong and Jacobs, 2014). This coordination may galvanize security commitments from China while allowing U.S. military planners to better match available funds to feasible strategic objectives for maritime security operations. Such cooperation with China would also reduce the potential for misunderstanding, confrontation and conflict with the U.S. To a limited extent, anti-piracy cooperation between the United States and China is already occurring. To be sure, the U.S. military does not historically employ forces toward mutual strategic objectives with a growing competitor or near rival. The fact that the U.S. military is getting smaller while the Chinese People’s Liberation Army is growing is both a concern and an opportunity. China currently lacks the naval capacity of the U.S. and America will remain the dominant force in the Pacific Ocean for the next decade, which means the U.S. military has the ability to facilitate the flow of energy to China, but this may not remain true in two decades. The U.S. is rapidly reducing its military across all branches, and an increased Chinese maritime hand in the region would not only ease the burden on the U.S. military as a global police force, but will ensure U.S.-Chinese national strategies grow dependent on each other (MacDaniel, 2012). On the Korean peninsula, China and U.S. share the desire for stability and peace. North Korean instigation and a possible U.S. response is a major concern for China, which is reliant on stability on its periphery. The regional message facilitated by increased military cooperation between China and the United States could deflate North Korean saber-rattling. Chinese assertiveness in the seas could further mute North Korean aggression. There is great risk associated with allowing security of the Straits of Hormuz and Malacca to fall to China and allowing an emerging power the capacity to shape the global oil market. This risk, however, is largely mitigated by the fact that China has a greater need for stability in these straits than any other nation. China must increase oil imports to keep pace with its growing economy and must therefore expand its regional maritime power to a global one. Further, China surely appreciates the U.S.’ history of force employment toward its strategic resources. There are, perhaps, greater risks for both nations in failing to partner to stabilize the maritime lines of commerce as their economies and national strategies grow dependent.
The situation in the West is perhaps more challenging than the Midwest. Although areas of the West Coast have sig-nificant wind resources, the West has a much larger population to serve, and California's new renewable energy man-dates likely can only be fulfilled through significant wind development and transmission buildout both within and out-side of California. Indeed, California is an electricity importer, and its demand affects much of the transmission [*1837] planning in the West. n180 As of August 2012, California had 4,425 MW of wind energy capacity online, rank-ing it third in the nation for total installed MW of wind energy. n181 However, due to its large electricity demand, in 2011 only 4.0% of California's electricity demand was generated by wind power, ranking it sixteenth among the states in percentage of state energy derived from wind. n182 Amended in 2011, California has one of the most aggressive RPSs in the nation. n183 With a deadline of January 1, 2012, to set utility-specific targets, the standard requires 33% of electricity sold in California to be generated by renewable energy resources by 2020. n184 To help reach this standard, California has implemented additional incentives to promote renewable energy, such as feed-in tariffs that set procurement rates for renewable energy at prices comparable to that of natural gas. n185 Additionally, California has created a structure of three "buckets" to meet the statutory obligations of the RPS: (1) RPS-qualifying products generated within the state or a California balancing authority, (2) products that are used to ensure power quality and provide incremental power, and (3) unbundled RECs (where the electric power is used separately from the environmental benefit, for example when wind energy is generated and used in Oregon, but a California utility purchases the REC). n186 To comply with the RPS, Bucket 1 must account for 50% of compliance products (increasing to 75% by 2017), and the cumulative percentage of Buckets 2 and 3 must be limited to 25%. n187 These restrictions could affect the demand for renewable energy and the need for transmission lines in [*1838] the West. California has also created the Renewable Energy Transmission Initiative ("RETI") to identify transmission projects required to meet the RPS goals and to bring together transmission stakeholders to create a comprehensive transmission plan for California. n188¶ Southern California Edison is planning the biggest transmission project in California's history: the Tehachapi Re-newable Transmission Project. It will transport wind energy from the Tehachapi area of Kern County to Southern Cali-fornia Edison's power grid, which serves 14 million people. The $ 3.5 billion line would be capable of carrying 4,500 MW. n189 The California Public Utility Commission ("CPUC") approved the first phase of the project in March 2007, and construction of that phase is underway. n190 The next phase involves 173 miles of transmission lines. n191 The project will be very important for linking renewable energy to California demand centers. In June 2011, Google announced that it would increase its investment in the Alta Wind Energy Center ("AWEC") in Tehachapi by providing another $ 102 million to finance the 168 MW Alta V Project. This adds to the $ 55 million Google has already invested in wind power in the area. n192 Also in June 2011, San Diego Gas & Electric announced large solar contracts, one of which will connect to the grid through the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project. n193 Despite the CPUC's approval of the project, Chino Hills sued to enforce its ability to grant right-of-way property rights, and to deny the CPUC's exclusive jurisdiction in this area. The state trial court held in 2010 that the CPUC had exclusive jurisdiction, the court of appeals affirmed that decision in September 2011, and the California Supreme Court denied [*1839] review in January 2012. n194 During the pendency of the appeals, however the CPUC stopped construction on the project for purposes of conducting additional review for the portion of the project through Chino Hills. n195¶ As an electricity importer, California will likely also need to rely on neighboring states to meet its renewable energy needs, though the current structure of the RPS limits the amount that can be generated outside of California. n196 While Arizona and Nevada can provide solar energy in the future if certain major projects come online, California has historically looked to Oregon for more immediately available wind energy. Indeed, Oregon has exported approximately half of its wind power to California since 1998. n197 As of June 2012, Oregon had 2,820 MW of wind power online, ranking it seventh in the nation, and deriving 7.1% of its electricity from wind. n198 In 2007, Oregon required its largest electric utilities (PacifiCorp, Portland General Electric, and the Eugene Water and Electric Board) to ensure 5% of their retail electricity was renewable by 2011, and the utilities met this standard. n199 The requirement increases to 15% by 2015, 20% by 2020, and 25% by 2025. n200 Smaller utilities will also have to meet renewable energy standards, but the percentage of renewable energy is either 5% or 10% based on the size of the utility. n201 Companies in Oregon that do not comply with the RPS are subject to a fine. n202 In 2010, Oregon began a pilot program for solar feed-in tariffs that offered payments by three participating utilities to [*1840] owners of solar energy systems for electricity produced by solar power. n203 Through 2014, the payment rates are between $ 0.30 and $ 0.37/kWh. n204 Oregon also has both tax credits for renewable energy-equipment manufacturers n205 and "community renewable energy feasibility funds" n206 to support renewable energy development.¶ While Oregon's policies have encouraged renewable growth, the state has not directly addressed the need for new transmission lines. n207 Similar to other states, "Oregon faces a growing schism between its lack of capacity to move en-ergy from renewable sources, while current legislation, tax policies, and public demand are creating incentives and pressure to develop these renewable energy sources." n208 To address these issues, the Governor created the Oregon En-ergy Planning Council ("OEPC") in 2008. n209 The first OEPC report, in December 2010, recommended "the state move forward with developing a comprehensive energy strategy to maintain its leadership in energy planning, conservation, and new renewable technology." n210 The report made specific recommendations to improve Oregon's transmission line-siting process, including the creation of a stronger link between the state PUC and the state Energy Facility Siting Council to (1) better address the public's concerns regarding the [*1841] necessity of new transmission lines, (2) cre-ate new regulations to balance the objectives of multiple affected state agencies, (3) develop clear siting standards to make the application process both more predictable and better able to realize the public benefits of new transmission, (4) eliminate the lack of communication and multiple levels of review by different state agencies, and (5) create a "phased study approach" that allows applicants to move forward in their applications while various studies are being conducted. n211¶ As noted above, Oregon has exported approximately half of its wind-generated power to California since 1998. n212 As a result, Oregon imports much of its electricity from other Western states such as coal-fired power from Montana and Wyoming. n213 In the meantime, however, Google and others are in the process of developing the 845 MW Shep-herd's Flat Wind Farm in Oregon, which is likely to be the largest in the world when completed. n214 The $ 2 billion pro-ject has received $ 100 million in funding from Google n215 as well as a $ 1.3 billion loan guarantee from the DOE. n216 The wind farm has received transmission rights, and is slated to become operational by September 2012; n217 100% of the power generated from this farm will be exported to California. n218¶ The lack of transmission capacity in the Pacific Northwest region has become acute, and wind farms have been forced to curtail energy production on a rolling basis. n219 This occurred in the Pacific Northwest in 2011, with 100,000 MWh curtailed after a particularly wet winter, rapidly warming spring, and low electricity demand for that time of year. n220 The massive amounts of hydroelectric power [*1842] swamped Bonneville Power Association's ("BPA") electric grid, causing BPA to curtail wind energy. n221 BPA insists that it did everything it could to incorporate wind into the sys-tem, but wind developers have built much faster than the Northwest Wind Integration Action Plan of 2007 predicted. n222 Wind farms filed a petition with FERC in the summer of 2011, asking FERC to force BPA to honor its transmission contracts and undertake "negative pricing," which would involve paying utilities outside the region to shut down their own generation and take all of BPA's excess power. n223 BPA contended that such actions would increase its own cus-tomers' rates, which would not be fair since most power is sold out of state. n224 In December 2011, FERC ordered BPA to establish new policies to avoid curtailing transmission access for wind generation during periods of surplus hydro-power and found that BPA's actions constituted a discriminatory practice under the FPA. n225¶ These developments in California and Oregon illustrate how states, even ones as large as California, cannot rely solely on their own renewable resources or transmission buildout to meet renewable energy goals. If Oregon is not suc-cessful in developing intrastate and interstate transmission, it will affect Oregon, California, and the entire Pacific Northwest, as shown by the difficulties of utilizing the BPA grid. California is certainly acting as a "laboratory of de-mocracy" n226 with its aggressive RPS, just as it has in many other areas of environmental protection, including vehicle emissions, smog, water-resource protection, and chemical regulation. In those areas, however, California could experi-ment and make progress on its own. [*1843] In the area of renewable energy, because of its dependence on outside sources of electricity and a transmission system to bring that power to the state, it must rely on other states, establish regional arrangements, seek federal assistance, and create an economic environment that encourages sufficient investment in transmission for the entire region.
THE WEST DOMINATES INTERNET GOVERNANCE, BUT THAT CAN CHANGE — Some developing nations have a legitimate beef with the “multi-stakeholder” model of Internet governance that the U.S. champions, the State Department’s ambassador to the Internet acknowledged yesterday. The current slate of stakeholders just isn’t diverse enough, Daniel Sepulveda said. In theory, the multi-stakeholder model means major decisions about how the Internet is organized are made by technical specialists at ICANN and other consensus-based non-profits rather than by national governments or multi-national organizations such as the United Nations. In practice, however, those non-profits are inordinately filled with Western government representatives, Western companies and Western civil society members, Sepulveda said on the sidelines of yesterday’s Internet Governance Forum meeting at The George Washington University.
Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution¶ in the mid-18th century, the release of car-¶ bon dioxide (CO2) from our industrial and agricultural activities, commonly referred to as “anthropogenic CO2” has resulted in an increase in atmospheric CO2concentrations from approximately 280¶ to 390 parts per million (ppm), with 30% of the in-¶ crease occurring in the last three decades. The atmospheric concentration of CO2is now higher than¶ experienced on Earth for more than 800,000 years.¶ These changes in CO2are projected to cause signiﬁcant temperature increases in the atmosphere and the¶ ocean surface in the coming decades. Over the industrial era, the ocean has absorbed about 30% of anthropogenic carbon emissions. This absorption has¶ beneﬁted humankind by signiﬁcantly curtailing the¶ growth of CO2levels in the atmosphere, thereby reducing the global warming realized to date. How-¶ ever, when anthropogenic CO¶ 2is absorbed by sea-¶ water, thereby increasing dissolved CO¶ 2 concentrations, chemical reactions occur that reduce both sea-¶ water pH and the concentration of carbonate ions in¶ a process known as “ocean acidiﬁcation” (OA). The¶ pH of ocean surface waters has already decreased by¶ about 0.1 units since the beginning of the industrial¶ revolution (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003; Feelyet al.,¶ 2004; Caldeira and Wickett, 2005), with a decrease of¶ ∼0.0018 yr−1observed over the last quarter century¶ at several open ocean time-series sites (Bates, 2007;¶ Bates and Peters, 2007; Santana-Casianoet al., 2007;¶ Doreet al., 2009). By the middle of this century atmospheric CO2levels could reach more than 500 ppm,¶ and over 800 ppm by the end of the century (Orret al.,¶ 2005). This would result in an additional decrease in¶ surface water pH of approximately 0.3 pH units by¶ 2100. As a result, acidity in the ocean would increase¶ by about 150% relative to the beginning of the industrial era.
No one who has surveyed the condition of public education, spent time in second- ary and university classrooms, or assessed the status of conventional knowledge and its transmission, reception, and application in the United States can doubt that an old order of literacy has passed. The pastoral, idyllic lyrics of "Schooldays, schooldays, dear old golden rule days," have given way to the postmodern indirection that Spike Lee calls "School Daze." A traditional order of "reading and writing and arithmetic" has yielded-in some cases, to alternative pedagogies and subjects, but more often to deliberate or slovenly indifference. All of these matters seem indisputably true. But the question of their interpretation and address remains very much an open-ended one. There may well exist a dire problem of literacy in our society, but we need seri- ously to ask in what terms we are to confront this problem. We seem, for example, to have given up on one traditional approach. "Why Johnny can't read" is not, for example, a serious query today. For if it were a serious query, then the decidedly economic overdetermination of Johnny's plight would not be so consistently ignored, erased, or denied. And we all remember when the "why" phrase was followed by "and what you can do about it." The nostalgia for a seriously-conceived and resolutely economic dedication to Johnny's problem is, per- haps, only a kind of sixties regressiveness. Currently-projected explanations for John- ny's relationship to literacy begin not with serious analysis, informed economics, or a commitment to situational reform. We are told, instead, that Johnny is a sufferer in the wake of wild-eyed radicals ("thugs" is sometimes the word used) of the sixties who brought the United States to desperate straits by abandoning Western ideals, misreading Nietzsche, and kicking prayer and the hickory stick out of the American classroom. We are urged to return to old, common ideas that "every American" needs to know, to put a legacy of acknowledged "Great Books" back into place, and to let the philos- ophers have their head in the maintenance of State affairs. One virtually hears Barbara Streisand in the background crooning "The Way We Were" as Alan Bloom exhorts a tearful congregation of ex-Cornell professors, and Wil- liam Bennett passes the collection plate for suggested "required readings" to reclaim a legacy. Meanwhile, Deacon Hirsch counts entries. Who is there to challenge this new Zion of whitemale literary evangelism? This chosen interpretation of a "crisis" and its solution? Johnny himself, of course-perhaps not in the voice and guise of Homer and the Classics, but surely in the voice and person of a new hybridity of interests and values. And Johnny, like his sister Johnetta, has a huge stake in such a challenge, because it is, finally, not book-learning, but the bodies of OTHERS that are most decisively in "crisis." That is to say, while whites may have the privilege of endlessly rehearsing a bookish dilemma, what I have described as newly-emergent people and voices have no such luxury. For behind the facade of a "battle of the books," as I have already suggested, lies a terrain of global realignment and multinational economic competition where what Bourdieu calls "cultural capital" has created radically new balances of exchange. What is expendable in the United States, Johnny and his fellows realize, is any body that attempts to ally itself with this current multicultural and shifting flow of world "cultural capital." While Spartan Greek youth wear walkmans from Japan and dance to the hip-hop rhythms of Run DMC, Salt-n-Peppa, N.W.A., and Public Enemy, whitemale cultural literacists nostalgically croon for a return of Homeric highlights and virtually sanction the disappearance of the very bodies that make United States' popular, public culture a valued currency of global exchange - and an informed source of critique for a postmodern world. In a too shorthanded manner, then, one might say that Johnny and Johnetta can't read "the classics" because neither the classics nor their advocates have realigned themselves and their project to read Johnny or Johnetta-or to listen to them, or to comprehend their postmodern connectedness to a re-formed future. You simply can- not teach a class of people whose life, language, and mores you don't in the least comprehend or respect. Indoctrinate, yes; teach, no. Rather than acknowledge and learn traditions and rhythms that would produce a relational pedagogy-one combin- ing what some hold to be a precious and privileged "legacy" with the long-ignored voices and inheritances that are emerging and being transmitted across cultural fron- tiers and international, telecommunal viewing spaces today-the American literacists who preach of "crisis" have adopted a strategy of willful ignorance and, ultimately, sanctioned aggression. Conserving the definite article the for humanities conceived only in selective, West- ern terms is the first move in the dance. Backward glances to a glorious past-one free of colonial expansion, racism, sexism, and self-interested imperialism-a past that never was-is the second move. The third and decisive move is-in a telecommunal age-to couch the crisis of the humanities in bookish terms, as though reading and writing were not mere technologies that favored an order of privileged ascendency and selective power and ideological control known even to Thoth and his King long ago. The fourth move in the current "crisis" project is to rid the kingdom of the very bodies of those who represent a "cultural" threat to what the literacists define as "our" national interest. Multiple incidents of campus and university violence against Black and Women, Chicano and Chicana, Asian, Native American, gay and lesbian students by Anglomale perpetrators-incidents that have frequently gone unpunished by Anglomale administrators and ignored by white academics bent on keeping their heads in cultural sands-testify to the expansiveness of this fourth initiative in the current dance of cultural "crisis." There have been more than 250 incidents of bias- related aggression on American campuses during the past two years alone (1987- 1989). Of course, the inner-city public schools of America and the deteriorating, crime- filled neighborhoods in which they fight to serve an educational mission in the absence of adequate funding or enlightened concern from the federal government offer further testimony to a killing indifference of our "crisis" thinkers. The OTHERS' defense of self is, thus, an inferable necessity of the current "crisis" in the humanities. Such a defense begins with dramatically reconceptualized self-definitions by people who are products of a history that has yet to be written. (A ritual and transformative drama teaching us our own beauty plays itself out at every turn.) With bodies on the line and life itself at stake, it hardly seems strange that Johnny might regard our cur- rent "crisis" advocates of "cultural literacy" as avatars of those white missionaries who paved the way for slavetraders, armies, and curious colonial scholars of the past. Faced with the prospect of such an enslaving and myopic "cultural literacy," Johnny and his fellows have bolted from the schools and given birth to energetic expressive forms such as postmodern hip-hop, interventionist film culture, and radical scholarship into gender, class, and race determinants of power and knowledge in the world we inhabit. In many ways, the powerful, syncretic, corporally minimalistic urgings of African- American rap music signal this legitime defense of a new humanity and a new humanities that will outlast the current "crisis" and create new room for the new people. One hears Public Enemy cautioning those who might be drawn into a sham "battle of the books" with the injunction: "Don't, don't, don't believe the hype!" Perhaps it is because rap is so effective in its expressive counters to a bookish "crisis" that those who "have had their chance" seek so forcefully to suppress it. Rap is the metonym for all of those shared sonics that emergent generations have brought to their own defense, to their own expressive soundings of the world. It summons in its urgings corridos of the southwest, Native American chant poems, Latin American magical realism, African and Caribbean lyrics, lesbian and gay signifiers, and so very much more that is undreamed of in the philosophies and books of the "crisis" people. The following letter may be taken as a representative response by "crisis thinkers" to a postmodern world in which rap and its correlates are emergent: A song recorded by the rap group N.W.A. on their album "Straight Outta Compton" encourages violence against and dis- respect for the law enforcement officer and has been brought to my attention. I understand your company recorded and distrib- uted this album, and I am writing to share my thoughts and con- cerns with you. Advocating violence and assault is wrong, and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action. Violent crime, a major problem in our country, reached an unprecedented high in 1988. Seventy-eight law enforcement officers were feloniously slain in the line of duty during 1988, four more than in 1987. Law enforcement officers dedicate their lives to the protection of our citizens, and recordings such as the one from N.W.A. are both discouraging and degrading to these brave, dedicated officers. Music plays a significant role in soci- ety, and I wanted you to be aware of the FBI's position relative to this song and its message. I believe my views reflect the opin- ion of the entire law enforcement community. The letter was written to Priority Records by Milt Ahlerich, an FBI assistant director, who reports directly to William Sessions, and who acknowledges that the letter rep- resents not his personal opinion, but the Bureau's official position. The letter is, to Ahlerich's best knowledge, the first instance in which the FBI has assumed such an official "cultural" position toward any expressive product. When asked for a comment on the Bureau's response to their rap .... Tha Police," one member of N.W.A. said: "Oh, I didn't know they were buying records, too!" The economic savvy and levity of this response seem appropriately deconstructive until one discovers that neither Ahlerich nor the FBI even owns a copy of "Straight Outta Compton," nor has anyone in the agency (especially Ahlerich prior to writing this letter) ever listened to the rap to which the Bureau has now "officially" objected. The "crisis" in the humanities (as I suggested earlier) may finally be like the FBI's buffoonish objectionism-a crisis of audition, a violent, reactionary cry by whitemen who have never bothered to listen to the rhythms and lyrics of OTHERS. Such willful disregard and lamentable ignorance may serve the moment, but, finally, they offer the surest path to white cultural illiteracy. As the rap group Public Enemy counts the numbers: "It takes a nation of millions to hold us back!" Nobody in America can afford such wasted manpower when our nation is already belated, behind the times and hard-pressed for any future whatso- ever. Today's "crisis" will only begin to abate when American whitemale nostalgia for ancient exclusionism gives way to conscientious audition and constructive pedagogy and scholarship based on the sounds of a postmodern world. James Baldwin once asserted in a famous essay about alienation and blackness that it was time for all of those who are nostalgic for prelapsarian days of exclusion to realize that the world "is no longer white, and will never be again." If we add "bookish" or "Great Bookish" to Baldwin's announcement we have, I think, fundamental postulates for listening be- yond the thresholds of our present "crisis" to sounds of a safer and more liberating future.
JEMAAH Islamiyah (JI) still poses a real threat to Indonesia and the region. The religious militant group, although has been crippled significantly after the 911 attacks, remains Indonesia’s major security threat today. JI also remains a regional threat to the Southeast Asia region as it commands a force structure within the four Mantiqis it helped to set up in Southeast Asia. JI has close and direct links with Al Qaeda since its inception by Abu Bakar Bashir, JI’s head and religious cleric. The relationship between JI and Al Qaeda remains a close knit relationship till today, as Abu Bakar Bashir was a close ally of Osama Bin Laden. His support came from Osama Bin Laden who assisted JI in training and funding for its operational capabilities and its force structure. My recent visit to Indonesia was significant to this article as it has supported my theory of this threat. The Indonesian government has also been complacent in its operations to counter terrorism and religious militancy due to the fact that a major attack has not taken place after the Bali bombings. The Indonesian authorities also are divided with issues pertaining to religion and what constitutes religious extremism and militancy. Political agendas in Indonesia also play a key role in addressing these sentiments. Power struggle and corruption within the government add to the political discourse of Indonesia. These issues also propagate religious extremism and create a platform for religious militancy to evolve providing the given scenarios. My trip en route to Bali indicates that the security forces on the island are not able to address a foreseen “terrorist” attack judging from the local authorities’ capabilities on the ground. The fact that a major attack has not taken place provides the belief that Bali is safe and that an “attack” is not comprehensible at this time! Is it so? Although Indonesia has significantly been able to monitor and curtail the threat (to a major extent), it is the support that the Australian authorities have provided that has enabled the Indonesian authorities to establish a secured parameter around the island of Bali. Besides the Australians, there is also the support of the Americans involved in training the counter terrorism task forces of Indonesia, Detachment 88. Detachment 88 of the special task force in countering terrorism has over the years been groomed as one of Indonesia’s best Special Forces in addressing terrorism, and by my views, considered a reliable and capable unit in addressing the threats of terrorism. The trainings provided by the two governments have significantly propelled Detachment 88 to a more efficient and capable unit. The Australian authorities have played a key role in assisting the Indonesian authorities after the Bali attacks which saw a large number of Australian tourists killed in the attack. Australia has provided technology to monitor the threats of terrorism and maritime threats with satellite monitoring capabilities as well as coastal monitoring equipments to assist in securing the threats of terrorism. Within the island of Bali, the population of Balinese is now being overtaken slowly by migrants from the Java Island who are predominantly Muslims. The migrant influx is due to the thriving tourist economy that has created more jobs within the islands of Indonesia. This has also provided a platform for terrorist, religious and extremist groups infiltrating the economy. From sources provided, the locals are aware of the steady migrants of the Javanese immigrants who are basically moving in owing to the economic opportunities being provided. Concerns are also growing that a steady flow of JI and extremist groups are also infiltrating the system. Sources claim that there are a number of JI “sleeping cells” within the Bali Island and this to me is alarming. Local sources also indicate that financing of “religious extremism” is still evident in Indonesia coming from the Middle East. Tourist spots such as Ubud and Kuta township districts are thriving with tourists from all over the world. How safe are they today in comparison to the Bali attacks? My visits to these places saw tourists of all walks of life enjoying the beautiful settings of these small townships and the atmosphere was very calm and peaceful. But as I was saying earlier, the local authorities are not prepared for an immediate disaster. This is not only of a terrorist attack but in all senses of “security”. The laid back attitude of the local authorities is seen to some extent, but nevertheless, it just could be their way of doing things. How well trained are the local police and authorities in curtailing some of these security threats? With the possible threat looming within the island of Bali, how are the maritime security parameters being protected? The threat of maritime terrorist attack in the Straits of Malacca uncovered by US troops in Afghanistan in an Al Qaeda video and JI’s manuscripts by Singapore intelligence in the region clearly indicate the plans of JI in the maritime domain. Is JI able to mount a maritime attack on the island’s port areas? From my views, yes! Two vessels at a nearby berthing pier near the Candidasa township district on the eastern part of Bali saw a Liquid Petrol Gas (LPG) tanker and a cargo tanker stay afloat either awaiting for new shipment or simply berthing there under Indonesia’s flag. The security parameter did not seem too convincing. The parameter was open to small boats which could easily move into close proximity of the vessels. Even though the tankers could be empty, simply the security protocols were not evident. Terrorist groups could easily plant explosive devices under and around the tanker without being noticed or simply by hijacking the vessel. The threat of a maritime terrorist attack may not be imminent for now but this sort of security protocols give leeways for easy targeting. A maritime attack could be devastating to Bali’s coastal waters. JI is still relevant and its links to Al Qaeda and the terrorist groups in the region is evermore a concern. The threats of maritime terrorism using piracy as a means to achieve its goals are tightly linked together. Maritime terrorism as a transnational threat is also evident and the reality seems to be very prospective for all groups in terms of the monetary gains it offers. The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) are some groups with these capabilities. The current threat scenario should be assessed with stringent risk management associated with the maritime domain. The influx of migrants into Bali should also be a serious security risk factor to be assessed by the local authorities to weed out JI operatives and religious militancy within the island. If JI operatives and religious extremists are seen to be moving into the island, a possible threat scenario is imminent. Proactive measures should be in place immediately before the island is influenced by extremism and terrorism. This eventually will be harder to curtail within the island if left untreated.
The  American  Enterprise  Institute and The Heritage Foundation’s China Global Investment Tracker follows large Chinese investments, excluding bonds, around the world. The leading recipient of these kinds of investments is the United States, which received nearly $100 billion between January 2005 and December 2015. The deals described in the tracker are worth $100 million or more and are voluntary transactions. They let ordinary people make their own economic choices. Chinese purchases benefit Americans who hold desirable assets, including individual family homes, not just office towers or giant corporations. Chinese investment helps support a small number of American jobs. China is not an enemy, but it is not a friend. Government involvement in Chinese investment in the US should be limited but some guidelines are necessary. Chinese firms and individuals should not be allowed to buy advanced technology that could have military uses. American policymakers should be aware that most Chinese firms have little familiarity with a competitive market under the rule of law, so their ability and willingness to obey American law should be monitored. If these guidelines are kept in place, Chinese investment in the US can continue to be a net positive for both countries
TOKYO — The Liberal Democratic Party of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has governed Japan in one way or another for all but four of the past 61 years, a winning record that reflects the political inertia of a society that values stability and tradition. But even by the standards of Japanese politics, Mr. Abe’s landslide victory in national elections on Sunday was stunning. For the first time, voters gave the Liberal Democrats and their allies more than two-thirds of the seats in Parliament — a supermajority that could allow Mr. Abe to realize his long-held ambition of revising the clause in the Constitution that renounces war and make Japan a military power capable of global leadership. Opinion polls show only lackluster support for Mr. Abe’s security agenda or even his program to revitalize the Japanese economy, but the public appeared unwilling to take another chance on the opposition Democratic Party, which stumbled badly in its last, rare stint in power, most notably in its response to the 2011 earthquake and Fukushima nuclear disaster. The vote for stability at home, though, is likely to provoke unease across Asia, where memories of Japanese militarism in World War II endure and the prospect of a more assertive Japan will add to worries over China’s territorial ambitions and North Korea’s nuclear program. In China, Xinhua, the state news agency, warned in a commentary on Monday that the election results “could pose a danger to Japan and regional stability.”
The ends Many of America’s whites believe that racial equality already has been achieved, while many of its non-whites hold that little has changed since the Civil Rights Movement and that things may be getting worse (Brown et al. 2003, 224–5). One side declares, ‘Racial harmony has arrived.’ The other side replies, ‘Racial harmony will never come.’ But the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Two things are undeniable: that racial progress in America has been nothing short of astounding and that racial domination in America has yet to be dismantled. As one sociologist has put it, ‘It can be said, unconditionally, that the changes that have taken place in the United States over the past fifty years are unparalleled in the history of minority–majority relations... .There does not exist a single case in modern or early history that comes anywhere near the record of America in changing majority attitudes, in guaranteeing legal and political rights, and in expanding socioeconomic opportunities for its disadvantaged minorities’ (Patterson 1998, 16). If we refuse to recognize this fact, we foster an angry spirit of cynicism and nihilism, a spirit of hopelessness that causes whites and non-whites to throw up their hands and conclude, ‘If racial equality is hopeless, then why should we do anything to fight it?’ Change has come to America. Indeed, some ethnic conflicts viewed as intractable and eternal a mere 100 years ago hardly exist today. One thinks, for example, of the conflict between Protestants and Catholics, or between Irish and Italians. The historical record demonstrates that what one generation found unrealistic and impossible – idealistic – the succeeding generation made into reality (Du Bois 1996 [1899], 386). ‘What is considered impossible today may be possible tomorrow,’ observe the authors of White-Washing Race. ‘It is well to remember that in the 1950s few Americans believed that a revolution in civil rights was just around the corner. Jim Crow seemed to be deeply entrenched, racial prejudice too formidable a presence in the minds of white Americans. Yet many people of all races vigorously opposed segregation anyway, not because they knew they would prevail, but because they believed that doing so was morally necessary. And in the end they did prevail’ (Brown et al. 2003, 248). We cannot deny the progress of the past, just as we cannot turn a blind eye to the problems of the present – or the pregnant promise of the future. Researchers and social commentators rightly have documented the (racial) troubles of today, but what does the future hold? What do we want it to hold? Social science is able to provide a much-needed picture of alternative realities. It can, in a phrase, present us with real utopias. Creative and radical alternatives for society ‘grounded in the real potentials of humanity’ as well as in social-scientific and historical research, real utopias are intellectually rigorous, carefully designed blueprints for a better tomorrow (Wright 2003, vii–viii; see also Bourdieu 2003, 17–25). They are the end products of social change; they are realistic renderings of a society more just, equal, and moral than the one we currently inhabit. Real utopias are hopeful but not naïve; realistic but not cynical. They are what America’s founding fathers envisioned when they longed for ‘a more perfect union’; what Karl Marx had in mind when he spoke of real or ‘human emancipation’ of the working class; of what Martin Luther King, Jr. dreamt when he referred to ‘the promised land.’ (For an extended discussion of realized real utopias in the political and economic spheres, see Cohen and Rogers 1993; Wright 2010.) To work toward racial justice, we must know precisely what we are working toward. Accordingly, in what follows, we sketch three goals, three real utopias, connected to the dismantling of racial domination. This discussion is not a venture in prediction, the stuff of social forecasting; rather, it is an exercise of the imagination. Nor do we paint a complete picture of what a racially just society might look like, a project too rich and expansive for our purposes here. We simply sketch what we believe are three ends essential to the ascension of racial justice, inviting you to fill in the details and, with us, to imagine further possibilities.
As mentioned previously, many past and present social movements have coopted, appropriated and erased Indigenous existence and land claims due largely to the fact that the majority of these social movements have rarely been conceptualized outside a Western, liberal/liberatory framework in which Native peoples are assumed to no longer exist. Settler colonialism was founded upon, shaped, and maintained by same underpinnings of these frameworks, so we must question how transformative these 8 Further examined in Grande (2015) on page 47. 28 frameworks are in addressing the ongoing colonization of Indigenous and other marginalized peoples within (and outside) the U.S. settler/imperial state. Building upon Leigh Patel’s (2016) call for a “[pause or] moratorium on social justice” (88) and I would also add multiculturalism, we must interrogate how these theories and tools of change reinstitute settler logics and sustain the structure of settler colonialism.
Title III of the PRWORA details a mandatory child support collection structure that must be established and operated if a state is to remain eligible for the full Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) grant. PRWORA requires states to enact legislation or regulations to: (1) expand the scope of existing in-hospital paternity establishment programs and to make them uniform; (2) streamline the process for the establishment of paternity; (3) provide authority to the child support enforcement agency to order genetic testing without the necessity of obtaining an order from any judicial or administrative tribunal; (4) create a state registry of all cases in which services for collection are provided by the state IV-D agency, which must include the amount of the obligation, a record of payments collected, the amount of arrears, if any, the distribution of collections, and identifying information on the parties and children; (5) coordinate the state registry with the Federal Case Registry, Federal Parent Locator Service, Medicaid agencies, and Interstate Information; (6) create a Directory of New Hires that will report to the Federal Parent Locator Service for matching; (7) match new hires against Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders; (8) require employers to send withholdings to the state disbursement unit within seven days after payday; (9) require the Social Security number of any applicant for a commercial driver's license, occupational license, professional license, or marriage license, and in any paternity or child support action; (10) adopt the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) by January 1, 1998; (11) use standard forms for interstate enforcement of child support by October 1, 1996; (12) create expedited procedures without court [*211] order for obtaining financial records by subpoena, imposing penalties for failure to respond to subpoena requests, requiring responses to other state requests for information, providing access to public records, ordering income withholding, and securing assets by intercept from workers' compensation benefits, judgments, settlements, and lotteries; (13) adopt the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act of 1981, or other similar act that creates a prima facie case of fraud for transfers of property to avoid support payment where a support obligation is owed; (14) establish liens against real estate and personal property as a matter of law for overdue support owed by a parent who resides or owns property in the state, and give full faith and credit to liens arising in sister states where such liens are properly recorded or served in accordance with state law; (14) withhold, suspend, or restrict drivers' licenses, professional and occupational licenses, and recreational licenses of individuals who owe child support.
Every infectious agent that has ever plagued humanity has had to adapt a specific strategy hut every strategy carries a corresponding cost and this makes human counterattack possible. Malaria is vicious and deadly but it relies on mosquitoes to spread from one human to the next, which means that draining swamps and putting up mosquito netting can all but halt endemic malaria. Smallpox is extraordinarily durable remaining infectious in the environment for years, but its very durability its essential rigidity is what makes it one of the easiest microbes to create a vaccine against. AIDS is almost invariably lethal because it attacks the body at its point of great vulnerability, that is, the immune system, but the fact that it targets blood cells is what makes it so relatively uninfectious. Viruses are not superhuman. I could go on, but the point is obvious. Any microbe capable of wiping us all out would have to be everything at once: as contagious as flu, as durable as the cold, as lethal as Ebola as stealth as HIV and so doggedly resistant to mutation that it would stay deadly over the course of a Ion epidemic. But viruses are not, well, superhuman. They cannot do everything at once. It is one of the ironies of the analysis of alarmists such as Preston that they are all too willing to point out the limitations of human beings, but they neglect to point out the limitations of microscopic life forms.
There are many provisions of the Act, but the core of the "no child left behind" concept appears as the conditions that must be satisfied to receive the federal grant. The statute says that a State must submit a plan demonstrating that it has adopted "challenging" academic standards and has provided for testing founded on those standards; based on those tests, the State must then demonstrate "adequate yearly progress" of all its students with the ultimate objective that "not later than 12 years after the end of the 2001-2002 school year, all students . . . will meet or ex ceed the State's proficient level of academic achievement."40 If the schools fail to improve, they are subject to what ultimately are quite dra matic corrective actions.41 But even though Congress has, through NCLB, been clear in setting forth a regulatory framework for public education at the state and local level, the Department of Education is acting now to "waive" that framework in order to give the states, and their derivative local authorities, "flexibility." Most notably, instead of "all students" being proficient by the end of the 2013-2014 school year, a State may set "annual measurable objectives" that are "ambitious but achievable": It will suffice if the goal is 100% proficiency by the end of the 2019-2020 school year; or a reduction by the 2016-2017 school year of one-half in the percentage of students in each group of students who are not profi cient; or if the State proposes yet another method "that is educationally sound and results in ambitious but achievable" annual measureable objectives.42 The sanctions for failing schools also need not be as stringent as the statute itself specifies.43 This is not to say that the state and local educational authorities can just take the federal money and do what they please under the revised framework. Under the Secretary's substitute regulatory scheme, there are new specific requirements to develop "college- and career-ready stand ards" and plans for "high-quality assessment" of student achievement.44 And it is not to say that what the Department proposes constitutes bad policy; maybe it makes sense. But it is to say that the Department proposes to substitute a new way of defining what is required to get the grant and a new way of measuring and enforcing compliance for the way that the Act itself had specified.
This is an opportune time for governors to take stock of their STEM initiatives. As state economies begin to recover from the recent recession, it is important to harmonize the STEM education agenda with the state’s economic agenda. Governors should ask the following questions:
When weighing the likelihood that the disproportionate whiteness of private schools would create opportunities for increasing or decreasing segregation, it is also important to consider the history of private schools that led to the concentration of white students. Economic factors partly explain this pattern, as white and Asian families have higher median incomes and are more likely to be able to afford private school than black or Latino families. If income were the only factor, private school vouchers might be an effective means to bring more racial diversity to these private schools. But the data suggest a more complicated story, as  white students are also more likely to attend private schools than black or Latino students from families with the same income. In some cases, especially in the South, predominantly white private schools were created as the result of deliberate efforts by white Christian parents to start private schools as an alternative to public schools, which were being integrated at the time. Many “segregation academies” refused admission to nonwhite students when they were created, and still remain de facto segregated. Discriminatory admission practices and school policies continue today. Most but not all states with voucher programs specify that participating schools cannot discriminate based on race or national origin. Only a couple of states prohibit discrimination based on religion or gender, and none have prohibitions against discrimination based on sexual orientation. As my colleague Kimberly Quick has documented, some private schools receiving public funds through vouchers in North Carolina, for example, restrict enrollment to Christian students, have policies enforcing gender norms and rejecting admission of LGBT students, or have discriminatory dress codes banning head scarves or limiting the size of afros. Putting aside the legal and ethical questions of sending public funds to private schools with these discriminatory policies, the history and current practices of some predominantly white private schools may make it unlikely that many students of color using vouchers would choose to attend or be admitted by these schools.
Family detention, and immigrant detention in general, have long been targets of criticism from human rights advocates who say the U.S. government has defaulted to a prison model for unauthorized immigrants, including those without criminal convictions. In theory, detention beds are reserved for unauthorized immigrants who pose the greatest risks to public security. But ICE has often detained lower-risk immigrants: a 2009 ICE report stated that the majority of immigrant detainees were considered to have a “low propensity for violence.” In the case of family detentions, the rationale is less rooted in public security concerns and more on the government’s desire to ensure that immigrants appear at their court hearings. The family detention center in Artesia, New Mexico, has been a particular sticking point for immigrants’ rights advocates; a coalition of civil rights groups filed a lawsuit against the federal government last month over what they said were abhorrent conditions and lack of due process for immigrants there. But detention is also expensive, costing an estimated $164 a day per detainee. A large chunk of that money goes to the private prison companies that operate more than half of the immigrant detention beds around the country. With at least 34,000 immigrants in detention every day, this cost amounts to more than $2 billion in taxpayer funds every year. Meanwhile, the U.S. has another cheaper option that is readily available, at a maximum cost of just $17 a day per person. Alternative-to-detention (ATD) programs have been a part of ICE’s operations for several years. These programs generally require no full-time facility or 24-hour surveillance; immigrants are supervised by case managers through period check-ins and, at times, unannounced home visits. One ATD program involves the use of electronic ankle monitors to track immigrants’ whereabouts, a method that has faced some backlash from advocacy groups. Several non-profits around the country run ATD programs of their own, providing supervision and care for immigrants awaiting deportation hearings. These programs are estimated to cost anywhere between 17 cents to $17 a day per person.
As the experiments showed, there are all sorts of things people do that they are eager to keep private, even though these sorts of things do not constitute doing “something wrong.” Privacy is indispensable to a wide range of human activities. If someone calls a suicide hotline or visits an abortion provider or frequents an online sex website or makes an appointment with a rehabilitation clinic or is treated for a disease, or if a whistle-blower calls a reporter, there are many reasons for keeping such acts private that have no connection to illegality or wrongdoing.
We all know that moving in this direction will elicit the screams of "socialism" from the usual predictable corners. The tired rhetoric lives on long after the cold war that orchestrated it fades out of memory. The audience for that rhetoric is fast fading, too. It is long overdue in the US for us to have a genuine conversation and struggle over our current economic system. Capitalism has gotten a free pass for far too long. We take pride in questioning, challenging, criticising and debating our health, education, military, transportation and other basic social institutions. We argue whether their current structures and functioning serve our needs. We work our way to changing them so they perform better. And so it should be. Yet, for decades now, we have failed to similarly question, challenge, criticise and debate our economic system: capitalism. Because a taboo protected capitalism, cheerleading and celebrating it became obligatory. Criticism and questions got banished as heresy, disloyalty or worse. Behind the protective taboo, capitalism degenerated into the ineffective, unequal, crisis-ridden social disaster we all now bear.  Capitalism is the problem – and the joblessness, homelessness, insecurity, and austerity it now imposes everywhere are the costs we bear. We have the people, the skills and the tools to produce the goods and services needed for a just society to prosper. We just need to reorganise our producing units differently, to go beyond a capitalist economic system that no longer serves our needs. Humanity learned to do without kings and emperors and slave masters. We found our way to a democratic alternative, however partial and unfinished the democratic project remains. We can now take the next step to realise that democratic project. We can bring democracy to our enterprises – by transforming them into cooperatives owned, operated and governed by democratic assemblies composed of all who work in them and all the residents of the communities who are interdependent with them. Let me conclude by offering a slogan: "The US can do better than corporate capitalism." Let that be an idea and a debate that this renewed movement can engage. Doing so would give an immense gift to the US and the world. It would break through the taboo, finally subjecting capitalism to the critiques and debates it has evaded for far too long – and at far too great a cost to all of us.
One issue that's already on (Interior Secretary) Zinke's plate at Interior is Native American education. Speaking at a March 8 hearing of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, the secretary acknowledged the failings of the Bureau of Indian Education. "Words cannot capture how terrible it is that children in schools overseen by Bureau of Indian Education are so poorly served," Zinke said. Many lawmakers agree that the schools should be a top priority for the new administration. But though Zinke has said he supports upgrading the schools, actually making changes is more difficult. "He responded as you might expect (during the March 8 hearing) -- that he was committed to it, that he understood the challenges and the situation, and he said it was on his highest priority list," (Senator John) McCain said. "He gave the right answers. And I believe him. But I've heard those same answers for years and years."
More than being a Cartesian philosopher in this regard, Heidegger's negligence of colonialism, slavery, and modernity -- all initiated prior to the political crises of the twentieth century -- means he gets to join the ranks of philosophers which constitute a Western tradition of white thought. To further draw out this argument, I bring in two texts from whiteness studies, Robin DiAngelo's "White Fragility" and Eduardo Bonilla-Silva's "The Invisible Weight of Whiteness: The Racial Grammar of Everyday Life in Contemporary America," in order to explain my conceptualization of 'whiteness'. To summarize, DiAngelo refers to 'White Fragility' as "a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves" (54). Bonilla-Silva, in turn, argues that racial domination necessitates a racial grammar which normalizes white supremacy and dominance through sociopolitical regulatory practices (174).1 Then, I refer to 'whiteness' as that which is made visible when the "normal" is questioned and what DiAngelo calls "[t]he insulated environment of racial protection" is shocked into White Fragility. For this conceptualization of 'whiteness' to be more comprehensive, though, we must be able to account for whiteness when it is invisible and silent. In this case, I refer to 'whiteness' as the normalization of white supremacy and white dominance, while racial grammar makes certain ideas intelligible in normalized spaces through a rhetoric of universalism which is intimately bound to power and hegemony. To concretize this theoretical development of whiteness, I borrow the concept "raceocracy" developed by social scientist Barnor Hesse. He uses the terms "raceocracy" to refer to the following: [T]he way in which race orders the political and social lives of people – without being accountable to any spoken or written discourse, simply because it’s performed as a shared social and institutional orientation. In other words, it’s racially performed in such a way that it sustains a broad range of people’s relationships by facilitating conventional aspects of life that everybody appears to agree upon. ("Raceocracy: An Interview with Dr. Barnor Hesse – Part 1.") Through this lens, whiteness as a racial identity is a crucial technology to the structure of race as it simultaneously marks particular bodies as white, affords them certain privileges, and uses these bodies to form and govern racially exclusive white spaces through the largely invisible and silent white gaze, performance of racial governance, and presence/absence of white privilege.2 In other words, my conceptualization of 'whiteness' is constituted by the ordering and governing of bodies in/and space. As such, we can inquire into whiteness not just as a form of racially exclusive society, but also as a form of racial identity. More explicitly, we can consider Heidegger's conceptualization of death as coming from a space of whiteness because of its representation as non-relational, singularizing, and its relation to mastery and subjectivity. I will not belabor this point, because the argument is quite simple and vaguely resembles Lévinas's critique. Heidegger ignores how Western colonial projects -- whether it be those which violently threw Sub-Saharan Africans across the Atlantic Ocean and enslaved them or those which dominated Muslims in French Algeria under quasi-apartheid rule -- stripped its victims of their social and political freedoms and at times subjected them to deaths including lynching, torture, and mass disease. 3 In this context, mastery and subjectivity must be seen as normalized white capabilities. Western colonial projects were driven by the desire to master geopolitical space through (imperial/colonial/violent) exploration and to master the enslaved African body (by way of racescience and plantation organization, for example). The reality of colonialism, slavery, and its relation to mastery and 'full' subjectivity reveals an iteration of death foreclosed by Heidegger's discussion: Death-as-possibility-to-be-killed-socially-and-politically-and-biologically-by-theexperience-of-slavery-and-colonial-violence. Can anyone wrap their hands around that? To stay within Heidegger's approach, being white might be seen as a phenomenological experience. I have revealed the whiteness of Heidegger's death by situating his concept Being-towards-death alongside pre-Holocaust Western colonial projects, and unsettled 'death' in Heideggerian philosophy. Through his un/racial grammar of universality, Heidegger forecloses the possibility of a relational death. Heidegger's death becomes incredibly fragile when supplemented by one word: white. Heidegger's (white) death is social, political, historical, and philosophical violence. While Heidegger's involvement with the Nazi party may have been convoluted, his whiteness certainly was not.
Even if Cuba ends its repressive human rights policies, other disputes between the United States and Cuba must be resolved before any easing of the embargo is considered. In particular, ongoing trademark issues would need to be addressed before the two nations could work toward normalizing relations. 146 During the embargo, several U.S. companies have used brand names that originated in Cuba, as increasingly strict federal laws have barred companies affiliated with the Cuban government from registering their products in the United States. 147 Without the embargo in place to block the Cuban entities’ claims to disputed trademarks, the clash over the rightful ownership of these trademarks could stretch from the U.S. courts to Congress to the boardrooms of some of the largest U.S. corporations. 148 In particular, disputes involving Havana Club rum and Cohiba cigars have spanned approximately a decade each in litigation. 149 Both the Havana Club rum and Cohiba cigar cases illustrate the trademark friction that exists between the United States and Cuba as a result of the trade embargo.
Xi has been frustrated in implementing some of his plans for China, which retains theoretically a collective leadership via the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee. He has thus formed 11 commissions which he chairs and has the decisive voice on issues such as security and the economy. He is also, said Qiao, seeking support from the grassroots, ­appealing over the top of officials not fully on message, including through his anti-­corruption campaign. Mao too “used the people to rebel on his behalf”. “Xi’s style is quite different, he talks less and does more.”
During the last three decades, Venezuela's human¶ population has roughly doubled (OCEI, 1970±1997b).¶ Thus, it is possible that if resource use rates increased,¶ they may have done so simply as a consequence of the¶ expanding population. However, if the economic crisis¶ signicantly affected patterns of resource use, a change¶ in rates pre- and post-economic crisis above and beyond¶ that explained by population growth should be detect able. I hypothesize that the rate of increase of resource¶ use after 1983 surpassed the rate of increase of the¶ human population. If this is the case, mechanisms apart¶ from population growth triggered by the economic crisis¶  should account for any observed increases in harvest¶ intensities.¶ Finally, although one might expect degradation of¶ natural resources with economic contraction, it is clear¶ that a failing economy is not a necessary condition for¶ resource degradation.

Taking the above three points as transfigurativcly inaugurating the Clausewitzian ideal of absolute war, it is not difficult to guess where this ideal is most perfectly realized. If we wished to name that "country" where the Clausewitzian ideal of absolute war is most demonstrably visible-where terrorism is almost celebrated- -then it could be no other than America. In the 1969 Le Thor seminar, Heidegger seems to imply an inability for America to think "the question of being" and couches this inability in the current reality of the American situation:
The last time Coast Guard cutters undertook a traditional naval mission was in Vietnam -- and even then, U.S. forces faced no real threat to their command of offshore waters. World War II, when Coast Guard seafarers dueled U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic, thus represents the service's last true encounter with high-intensity naval warfare.
Not only has the science about chemical and biological weapons been quite sophisticated for more than a century, but that science has become massively more developed over that period. Moreover, governments (not just small terrorist groups) have spent a great deal of money over decades in an effort to make the weapons more effective. Yet, although there have been great improvements in the lethality, effectiveness, and deployment of conventional and nuclear weapons during that time, the difficulties of controlling and dispersing chemical and biological substances seem to have persisted. Perhaps dedicated terrorists will, in time, figure it out. However, the experience in the 1990s of the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo suggests there are great difficulties. The group had some 300 scientists in its employ and an estimated budget of $1 billion, and it reportedly tried at least nine times over five years to set off biological weapons by spraying pathogens from trucks and wafting them from rooftops, hoping fancifully to ignite an apocalyptic war. These efforts failed to create a single fatality; in fact, nobody even noticed that the attacks had taken place. It was at that point that the group abandoned its biological efforts in frustration and instead turned to the infamous sarin chemical attack.29 As two analysts stress, there have been so few biological (and chemical) terrorist attacks because they would require overcoming several major technical hurdles. Among them: gaining access to specialized ingredients, acquiring equipment and know-how to produce and disperse the agents, and creating an organization that can resist infiltration or early detection by law enforcement.30 In the meantime, the science with respect to detecting and ably responding to such attacks is likely to grow. Although acknowledging that things could change in the future, the Gilmore Commission has concluded, “As easy as some argue that it may be for terrorists to culture anthrax spores or brew up a concoction of deadly nerve gas, the effective dissemination or dispersal of these viruses and poisons still presents serious technological hurdles that greatly inhibit their effective use.” 31
A major new initiative for the promotion of food self-sufficiency has been urban agriculture. This form of agriculture was almost neglected in Cuba when food was affordable. However, urban gardening was the first reaction of the population to overcoming food shortages (Murphy, 1999). At the beginning of the crisis, people organized themselves to cultivate vacant lots, backyards and rooftops in the cities. Even animals were reared inside the houses in order to assure the families’ food supply. From the middle of the 1990s, urban agriculture was transformed from subsistence production to a practice that also included commercial activities. It was based in the use of local resources and minimum transportation costs of both inputs and products (Cruz and Sánchez, 2001). The “Horticultural Club” formed in the Havana suburb of Santa Fe in 1992-1993 was the first to organize urbanites for the purpose of providing them with technical assistance and creating a framework for urban production. This movement grew very fast in Havana city and subsequently around the whole country. By 1995, there were already 1,613 organoponics (i.e. small plots of abandoned land in the cities where beds of soil and sources of organic matter are used to produce fresh vegetables), 429 intensive gardens and 26,604 community gardens. In 1997, a network of municipal enterprises and State institutions (the National System of Urban Agriculture) was created to organize the people already involved in urban agriculture. The government still plays an important promotion and support role in this massive movement towards food security. The principal objective of the Cuban urban agriculture movement is to increase the daily consumption of vegetables to 300 grams per citizen, the amount recommended by UN FAO. Spatially, it covers a radius of 10 km from the center of the capital city of each province; 5 km from the center of municipal capitals; 2 km around population centers of more than 10,000 residents, and local production for settlements of less than 1,000 people. The following basic principles of urban agriculture in Cuba define its objectives and organization (Companioni et al., 2002).• Uniform distribution throughout the country (i.e. in every area of the country with an urban population, urban agriculture should be developed) • Local consumption by the urban population of local production in each region • Crop-animal integration with maximum synergy (i.e. internal cycling of nutrients) to boost production • Intensive use of organic matter to increase and conserve soil fertility • Employment of biological pest controls • Use of all available land to produce food, guaranteeing intensive but not import-dependent high yields of crops and livestock • Multidisciplinary integration and intensive application of science and technology • A fresh supply of good quality products offered directly to the population, guaranteeing a balanced production of not less than 300g of vegetables daily per capita and an adequate variety of animal protein • Maximum use of the food production potential, such as the available labor force and the recycling of wastes and by-products for plant nutrients and animal feed The organizational and administrative base of the urban agriculture program is the 28 sub-programs related to all aspects of animal and plant production found in the country (GNAU, 2004). These subprograms include, for example, management and conservation of soils, use of organic matter, seed production, vegetables and fresh herbs and spices, fruit trees, popular production of rice, grains, animal feed, apiculture, livestock, aquaculture, marketing, small agro-industries (Companioni et al., 2002). Taken together, Cuban urban agriculture has the components to achieve a systems approach; however, each program is supervised separately, responding to its specific factors and providing specialized technical assistance. 8.2. Popular production of rice: example of a successful sub-program Rice is the basic food in Cuba. Consumed together with beans, meat, vegetables and even fruits, is the essential plate of daily ration for Cubans. Its per capita consumption exceeds 44 kg, i.e. 265 g per day (Socorro et al., 2002). Rice production in Cuba was developed for many years in large State farms and it was also one of the prioritized crops at the beginning of the "Special period", when it appeared "irrefutable" that conventional, high-input methods were the only possible way to supply enough rice to meet the populations’ needs (León, 1996). However, even during 1980s, when unlimited inputs were available, the national demand was not met and therefore it was necessary to import 40% of rice consumed, and national high-input rice production showed to be unsustainable at the onset of the crisis of the 1990s. The new “Popular Rice” program demonstrated that, even without high initial expectations, this form of self-organization and low-input agriculture had a positive impact on national food self-sufficiency (García, 2003). The “popular” production of rice (arroz popular) was originally a grassroots movement towards self-provisioning. People started to cultivate this cereal in abandoned areas, in small plots between sugar cane fields, in road ditches, etc. This movement grew rapidly and achieved unforeseen levels of production and efficiency. In 1997, while the severely affected Union of Rice Enterprises (Unión de Empresas del Arroz) produced 150,000 tons, “popular rice” production achieved 140,600 tons, involving 73,500 small producers. The yields obtained by such ways were 2.82 tons per hectare as a national average, without the use of costly inputs (Granma, 1998), while conventional rice production during 1980s achieved a national average of between 2 and 3 tons per hectare (ANPP, 1991). In 2001, popular rice comprised more than 50% of total domestic rice production (García, 2003). 8.3. Success and the future of urban agriculture In the year 2000, urban agriculture produced more than 1.64 million tons of vegetables and employed 201,000 workers (Granma, 2001). Two years later, 326,000 people were linked with the program of urban backyard production, benefiting some 75% of the population (Granma, 2003). In 2005 the production was 4.1 million tons and employed 354,000 people (Granma, 2006). The reported production of 20 kg per square meter achieved by urban agriculture, allowed exceeding 300 grams of vegetables per citizen per day. This movement has also contributed to the establishment of a network of 1,270 points of sale of agricultural products in the cities and 932 agricultural markets (Granma, 2003a). The products distributed via this network significantly contribute to food security although the prices are still high considering the average buying capacity of the population. The quantity of people dedicated to agricultural labor in the city periphery continues to increase. However Cruz and Sánchez (2001) consider that this type of agriculture, emerging as a solution to food scarcity and unemployment in the cities, ought to look for a more integrated approach that goes beyond a temporary solution to the crisis and toward a more holistic concept than just food security. They suggest a concept which emphasizes the preservation of urban environment and the permanent management of resources in the urban settings, avoiding pollution of air and water as well as creating a culture of nature conservation. Although cities became productive in terms of food, this still comprised a small part of the country’s overall needs. Thus, the development of participatory, low-input “rural food production” was crucial at the onset of the 1990s. An alternative model to the prevailing conventional agriculture paradigm was established at national level, not only in State Enterprises and the UBPCs, but also in private individual and cooperative production. The input substitution strategy was a second step for the conversion towards a more sustainable agriculture in Cuba.
4) The Obama crowd think that legality under international law is crucial but here, as in so many other contexts, liberals accept conservatives' framing of the issue. And for the conservatives, international law either doesn't exist or is a tool of some combination of our effete (read "French") allies and our enemies. Thus, they regard international law as so sullied that it cannot even be invoked directly.
But praise for the amateur also has its limits. To ignore the need for critical disciplinary intellectuals with various forms of scientific expertise is to [end page 77] abdicate responsibility for a host of issues involving knowledge of fields ranging from physics and genetics to electronics and even environmentalism. There is surely an overabundance of jargon and mystification and, as has been mentioned before, the need exists for a new sensitivity to the vernacular.39 But it is also the case that complex issues sometimes require complex language and, often for good reasons, fields generate their own vocabularies. A judgment is undoubtedly necessary with respect to whether the language employed in a work is necessary for illuminating the issue under investigation: that judgment, however, can never be made in advance. There must be a place for the technocrat with a political conscience as surely as for the humanist with a particular specialty. The battle against oppression requires a multi-frontal strategy. Best to consider the words of Primo Levi who understands the critical intellectual as a "person educated beyond his daily trade, whose culture is alive insofar as it makes an effort to renew itself, and keep up to date, and who does not react with indifference or irritation when confronted by any branch of knowledge, even though, obviously, he cannot cultivate all of them."40
Part of our task is recuperative: to point out that there bas been work on surveillance done by feminists for quite. some time. As well, we take as our charge to highlight areas where a focus on surveillance requires explicit attention to critical feminist concerns. The "'critical" part of our project-which should be understood hereafter as implicit in our use of the term feminist - hails from a critical tradition that has at its core all activist and. interventionist agenda, and a questioning of the taken -for-granted, of what is often mundane and seamless with a profound sense that what goes unquestioned can be dangerous, particularly for disenfranchised bodies. Our critical feminist approach involves a feminist praxis that , centers intersectionality. We argue that surveillance is inseparable from what feminist theorist Sherene Razack (IY98) , calls  interlocking oppressions, ones that are often integral to the structures that underlie our culture. We understand a feminist praxis to highIight the interaction between theory and practice that is greater than the sum of those parts"' {Mahraj 201U, 17). A feminist praxis is not limited to gender issues, but rather sees gender as part and parcel of a number of contingent issues~ such as race, sexuality, class~ and able- and disabledbodiedness~ insisting that these cannot be viewed in isolation. Each essay in this volume exhibits a feminist praxis in its approach to the study of surveillance. How we engage questions related to surveillance-and what can be left out in these articulations- is a key concern in this volume. For instance, we've seen scholarly trends toward an ,analysis of the role. newer technologies play in surveillance more broadly (Andrej'8vic 2007; Gates 2011; 1. Kerr et al. 2(09), but with much focus on privacy issues. New database technologies, newer forms of information storehouses, as well as newer communication technologies, like cell phones and PDAS (persona] digital assistants), have had pernicious implications for individual and group privacy. Privacy is, however, a limited lens for thinking about surveillance, since it is a right not granted equally to all, a fact that needs to be taken into account in such investigations. Of course, "new methods of authentication, verification and surveillance have increasingly allowed persons and things to be digitally or biometrically identified, lagged, tracked, and monitored in real time and in formats that can be Captured, archived, and retrieved indefinitely-' (Kerr let al. 2009, xxiv)" so newer surveillance technologies do have implications for "informational privacy" -defined as ~the claim of individuals, groups or institutions to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent information about them is communicated to others" (ibid., xnrii). In light of these developments, we need to ask the larger questions: who is considered to have a right to privacy? Whose privacy is not a concern and why"? And importantly, how might a focus on these questions shape the field of surveillance studies? For instance, many communities-including prisoners, those receiving certain forms of welfare from the state, people with disabilities living in institutional care" as well as immigrants and refugees- have historically had, and continue to have, their bodily privacy invaded~ but there is almost no public discussion ,about the. infringement of their rights to privacy. As Rachel Hall notes in her ,contribution to this collection, privacy concerns have not kept vulnerable communities safer in the case of patriarchal violence, which often happens in the private·· space of the home. Hall shows us that part of the project of a feminist approach to surveillance studies is to 'shift critical surveillance studies away from matters of privacy~ security, and efficiency to a consideration of the ethical problem of combatting new forms of discrimination that are practiced in relation to categories of privilege, access, and risk" (147). This volume makes the case that the ways in which supposedly ~neutral" technologies are used requires a feminist analysis to access issues of disenfranchisement For instance, although whole-body imaging technologies are specifically marketed to emphasize that they do not profile individuals based on the. ,color of their skin, these technologies nevertheless, in directly targeting particular communities (including working -class people." people with disabilities, and Muslim women) in ways that line up ',with the racist and Islamophobie imperatives of the U.S. state, serve to intensify existing inequalities. For example, backscatter x-rays continue the direct attack on the civil rights of transgender folks~ ,as they can visualize objects including breast prostheses and dildos, and thus “out" trans people to airport screeners~ and in doing so, make transgender travelers vulnerable to transphobic screeners. In some cases, particularly in small towns, these newer surveillance technologies result in the outing of transgender folks who pass in their communities, putting at risk their jobs as well as their relationships with their families and friends (Magnet and Rodgers 2012). These technologies ,also ,explicitly violate the religious prohibitions of many religious groups, including some Muslim, women, and they have a disproportionate impact on. people with disabilities, as they visualize urostomy and colostomy bags (ibid.).l
There is no one supreme legislative grant augmenting federal surveillance powers. n30 Surveillance authority grew over time and through various, often unrelated bills. There is no effective point of origin from which to begin analyzing legislative conferrals of surveillance authority. But the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ("FISA") n31 is perhaps the logical starting point because it established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ("FISA Court"), n32 which is currently under scrutiny for its centrality in [*1459] President Obama's overall surveillance scheme. n33 Congress amended FISA numerous times, most importantly in 2001, n34 2007, n35 and 2008. n36 The FISA Court is presently the body empowered to curb federal surveillance power: it considers governmental requests for surveillance warrants. n37 But, arguably, this deliberation is strictly nominal and an unsatisfying check on potentially unlimited governmental power in the surveillance realm. n38
2. State Jurisdiction under Art. 1 ECHR and Art. 2 (1) ICCPR The next challenge is to establish what exactly being under a state’s jurisdiction means and entails. In order to elaborate the concept, which would be applicable to foreign surveillance activities, the following section outlines the major findings of the HRC and the ECtHR on extraterritoriality. Both bodies have had the opportunity to decide on whether the human rights treaties in question apply outside of a State’s party territory. a. First Extraterritorial Steps For the simple reason that ‘jurisdiction’ has emerged as the basis of sovereignty and state’s sovereign powers, the original notion of jurisdiction is necessarily linked with the idea of territorial powers.61 That is why jurisdiction is closely related to the national territory.62 However in the interventionist age63 we live, with the growth of operations conducted abroad and the ever-increasing number of individuals brought under some form of foreign de facto control, the question of human rights treaties’ applicability although vague in terms of the exact guarantees’ scope is quite significant. Taking this in account, the ECtHR has only accepted in exceptional cases that acts carried out by the Member States outside their territories can be an exercise of jurisdiction in the sense of Art. 1 ECHR.64 The territorial scope of the ECHR has been a point of contention for quite some time. Although Art. 1 ECHR has received some fair attention in the Court’s case law; the ECtHR’s position is far from uniform. It had a promising start with the Loizidou case,65 where the Court accepted that the treaty has a certain degree of extraterritorial effect, coupling the Convention’s application with the requirement of effective control employed by a State Party in a certain area. What mattered was the question of effective control, regardless of whether it was based on an unlawful act, i.e. violation of the territorial state’s sovereignty.66 In the later judgement of Cyprus v Turkey, the justices of the Grand Chamber reaffirmed their position, adding to the previous argumentation the need to reject the otherwise resulting ‘regrettable vacuum in the system of human-rights protection’.67 In a similar cautious manner, the early HRC only ruled in favour of extraterritorial application in ‘exceptional circumstances’, such as when states acted against their own citizens living abroad.68 However, it must be also acknowledged that in comparison to the ECtHR, the Committee’s degree of practice in the matter of extraterritoriality is more limited by the simple fact that it receives fewer complaints than its European counterpart. As will be illustrated below, the consequence is that the Committee often turns to the judgements delivered by the ECtHR for interpretation help. In the so called Passport cases,69 the HRC found that States parties are responsible for infringements of the Covenant committed by their foreign diplomatic representatives. Further, considering the cases of individuals kidnapped by Uruguayan agents in neighbouring countries, the Committee held that States parties are liable for the actions of their agents on foreign territory.70 The HRC thus accepted the extraterritorial application of the ICCPR in cases where state agents exercised authority and control over individuals, rather than over areas. This same approach used by the ECtHR in one of its early Cyprus cases,71 where it had found that States parties are ‘bound to secure the rights and freedoms to all persons under their actual authority’. In other words, what mattered was the relationship between the individual and the state and not where the alleged violation occurred.72 b. Jurisdictional Approaches after Bankovic What looked like an auspicious (although not entirely uniform) beginning that kept pace with recent developments in the international community, took a step back with the Bankovic admissibility decision.73 In this case, the ECtHR found that the victims of an air strike on a TV station in Belgrade had never been ‘within the jurisdiction’ of the NATO Member States. The Court observed that only effective control – an exercise of all or some public power – over a territory and its inhabitants due to a military occupation or an explicit agreement could bring the situation within the jurisdiction of the ‘occupying’ state. The mere repercussions of States parties’ actions, i.e. dropping bombs over Belgrade, would not trigger control over the territory or individuals in question.74 This approach, clearly leaning towards the pronouncement of the Convention’s extraterritorial application as an exception, has casted quite some doubt on the Court’s reasoning, which has been a point of critique and discussion ever since. The decision in the Issa case75 led to further confusion with its observation that ‘Art. 1 of the Convention cannot be interpreted so as to allow a State party to perpetrate violations of the Convention on the territory of another State, which it could not perpetrate on its own territory’. The Court stipulated that even short-term military operations in a territory brought the individuals there under the jurisdiction of the acting state. In the Ilascu case,76 the Court affirmed the triggering effect of military control in an area, but this time it reduced the requirement to ‘overall control’. This so-called ‘more generous approach’77 was later followed in the Al-Skeini78 judgement as well, where the Court explained that the test of jurisdiction could be met either through control over an individual or over a certain area. In addition, a state can exercise effective control either directly, through its own armed forces, or by means of a ‘subordinate local administration’.79 Thus, it would seem that the ECtHR was moving away from the view that jurisdiction is an all-or-nothing matter,80 trying to correct to some extent the Bankovic findings by reducing the degree of control required over a territory. A further development in the Court’s approach was brought by the case of Öcalan v Turkey,81 a case involving the handing-over of a suspect of terrorist-related crimes to Turkish officials in Kenya. The ECtHR noted that the suspect was ‘effectively under Turkish authority and therefore within the jurisdiction of Turkey’ after the handing-over was completed.82 Simplifying this statement means that the State party in question does not need to exercise all public powers, for even some exercise of public powers is sufficient to trigger jurisdiction, although not in an exclusive manner with regard to all other states and their rights. In the meantime, the HRC, which from its very inception has sought a way to provide a reading of Art. 2 (1) ICCPR that renders appropriate legal protection and had therefore followed the disjunctive interpretation, extended the application of the Covenant to actions of state authorities in occupied territories as well.83 For example, as the Committee has stated in its recent comments on Israel, the latter bears responsibility for implementation of the ICCPR within Israel, as well as the Occupied Palestinian Territories in the West Bank and Gaza84 where Israel exercised effective jurisdiction and effective control. The HRC’s line of arguments appears to follow Bankovic, that is, it is based on an ‘effective control’ approach.85 The Committee has applied this approach in a number of different contexts where the state acts or takes measures on the territory of another state and these have an effect on persons within that other state’s territory.86 In GC 31 the Committee reaffirmed its position, asserting that a State Party must provide for the Covenant’s rights to anyone within its power or effective control, even if not situated within its respective national borders and without concern for the circumstances in which such power or effective control was obtained.87 In other words, in the view of the Committee, states are always bound to both respect and ensure that individuals receive maximum protection of their human rights.88 Through this position the HRC has officially developed a case law that some scholars have criticized for being purposive89 and rather goal-oriented. While this presumption may or may not be true and could be the topic of an entirely different investigation, it demonstrates one of the core problems of extraterritoriality – namely that human rights protections are necessarily extraterritorial. This issue will be addressed in a moment under 2. d). c. The Test of ‘Subject to its Effective Control’ in the Surveillance Context As it was illustrated above, the effective control over territory or over individuals test represents the best synthesis of the ECtHR’s current extraterritorial jurisprudence, supported by the HRC as well. However, this approach was put into place long before one could even consider the issue of foreign surveillance and its impact on the discussion. The ‘effective control’ notion is adequate to analyse the actions in real time taken abroad by state agents,90 but in the cyber domain, the physical control over persons or territory is not very useful.91 The NSA has the capacity to remotely control and filter much of the communications of a foreign national abroad and, as indicated in the press, the agency can break different forms of encryptions thanks to so-called ‘back-doors’ it has engineered in many software systems.92 In addition, the implantation of tiny radio transmitters in most of the computers produced in the US grants the NSA the capacity to gain control over computers not connected to the Internet.93 Considering also that much of the Internet traffic is routed through the US, makes the picture complete – physical control does not play a role at all. That is why in order to answer the question how surveilling a foreign national’s communications renders that person subject to the surveilling state’s jurisdiction,94 the concept needs to be adapted to the cyber context. A narrow standard does not do justice to the rapidly evolving technology, but an official solution has not been established yet, although one of the first cases concerning external communications’ interception is already being dealt with in Strasbourg.95 In this regard, Margulies suggests the virtual control test as an approach that at least for now can meet this challenge.96 Applying this standard has two advantages: first, it works closely with the notion of control developed and required in the jurisprudence discussed above; second, it considers and bridges the changing technological circumstances that any practitioner would face when dealing with questions of jurisdiction triggering human rights obligations in surveillance cases. The intelligence agencies under scrutiny are perfectly capable of controlling lives and private information with the press of a button. Without a proper assimilation of the effective control test in cyberspace these intrusions would remain unaddressed and would run counter to substantial human rights principles. Privacy rights should be protected even when interferences have been initiated in a place different than the affected individuals’ abode. The virtual control test is thus preferable when assessing the extraterritorial application of privacy interests in cases of foreign surveillance. d. Type of State Obligations in the Extraterritorial Application What has become clear from the above sub-sections is that both the ECtHR and the HRC, certainly not uninfluenced from each other’s findings and interpretations, apply the treaties in question outside of the national borders of the States parties. The current stance of both bodies is to answer in affirmative the question of jurisdiction where some kind of public power has a controlling effect over an area or an individual abroad. What needs a point of clarification, however, is what exactly states are obliged to do when their jurisdiction is triggered. In this regard it is important to turn again to the original treaty provisions. While the ICCPR text requires states to ‘respect and ensure’97 the rights in the Covenant and, as it was illustrated above, the Committee has gladly taken up this wording in its demands for effective rights protection, Art. 1 ECHR speaks of ‘securing’ the respective rights and freedoms. However, despite the differences in the wording of these treaty provisions, it has become customary to apply the tripartite typology of respect – protect – fulfil when assessing state’s obligations under a human right treaty.98 One can also categorize the duty to respect as closely corresponding to negative obligations,99s and the other two dimensions (protect and fulfil) to positive obligations.100 Since ‘to secure’ in Art. 1 ECHR and ‘to respect and to ensure’ in Art. 2 (1) ICCPR encompass both negative and positive obligations, it can be acted on the assumption that both treaties mean the same. Now, the problem with the extraterritorial application is constituted by the fact that interventions abroad take place in forms other than extensive and long-term military operations and occupations. In many cases, there are actions that can and are accomplished in a matter of days or even hours. Under these circumstances, the foreign state acting abroad cannot be expected to also positively ensure or protect human rights, for it does not have the respective powers to adopt any legislative, judicial or administrative or other appropriate measures in order to fulfil its positive legal obligations. It can only make sure to respect and not to interfere with the rights of the individuals. A further difficulty arises out of the fact that the bodies entrusted with the application and interpretation of the provisions have either left the question of the exact nature of the obligation unaddressed or have opted for an ‘all-or nothing’ approach. In other words, the approach is everything but conclusive.
In a neoliberal state, argues David Harvey, the ‘‘institutional arrangements considered essential to guarantee individual freedoms are strong individual property rights, the rule of law, and the institutions of freely functioning markets and free trade.’’20 The state’s role is to secure and protect these rights—hence the contradiction of intervention in the name of freedom. Unlike the Texas Rangers, who were indiscriminate in their racism, the Minutemen are willing to concede that some undocumented people are not terrorists but, rather, desperate for work. As Simcox put it, ‘‘These are innocent victims of their governments who aren’t guaranteeing themjobs.’’ The Minutemen support the creation of a guest worker program; says Bob Wright, ‘‘All we ask is that immigrants come through the gate and sign the guestbook.’’ A guest worker program temporarily resolves the tensions inherent in the need, on the one hand, for a mobile labor force and, on the other hand, for secure borders. It answers the question of how the very people one defines as threats to national security and purity can also be given some kind of provisional legal status given their critical status to the economy—to the homes and gardens of middle-class Americans, to the hotels and restaurants of every city, to the meatpacking plants of Iowa and Nebraska, to the vineyards and orchards of California. Both Presidents Fox and Bush have called for a guest worker program, although they disagree on the form it would take, and one rationale is that such a program would help distinguish between legitimate workers and potential security threats. As Magdalena Carral, commissioner of the Mexican National Migration Institute, has argued, ‘‘The regularization of undocumented Mexicans in the United States would allow for the identification of a large segment of people already settled in the country that do not represent a security threat. The contribution of these Mexicans to the U.S. economy has been recognized by the U.S. private sector.’’21 The market sets the terms for ‘‘the rule of law’’—‘‘aliens’’ can become temporarily legal and thus gain some rights if they prove their worth to the nation as productive workers and potential consumers. This is just a temporary state of belonging, however, for Bush’s guest worker program requires that workers eventually return to their home countries.22 The border must remain open to the regulated flow of workers back and forth as well as to the flow of goods back and forth across the border—produced in the maquiladoras by cheap Mexican labor and consumed in the United States, a process expanded by the passage of theNorth American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. In this neoliberal environment, it comes as no surprise that one of the examples of human rights abuses cited byMinuteman opponents is linked to consumerism. In their patrols along the Arizona border in April 2005, several members of the Minutemen detained a Mexican man and forced himto pose for a picture holding a T-shirt with theman, Bryan Barton, who had spotted him. The shirt said, ‘‘Bryan Barton caught an illegal alien and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.’’23 One wonders if the T-shirt was made just across the border. ‘‘Ordinary People’’ The work of the good citizen/volunteer provides the legitimation for more insidious and violent forms of vigilantism and state-sponsored militarism that come to seem necessary, even normalized, given the current security crisis. If Homeland Security and the volunteer force are doing all they can to seal the borders, doesn’t that then suggest there is a need for more militaristic solutions? ‘‘You are ordinary people, but these are extraordinary times,’’ Wright told the potential volunteers in Las Cruces. Adherence to the law today becomes the rationale for future violations of the law. Some Minutemen chapters have said they will carry weapons. In California, a Minuteman group led by Jim Chase urged volunteers to bring baseball bats, Mace, pepper spray, and machetes, until the Border Patrol learned about it and raised concerns. Chase said that instead they would carry guns: ‘‘The guns are for one reason—to keep my people alive,’’ he said.24 The Minutemen are attracting neo-Nazis even if they are not recruiting them. According to Amanda Susskind and JoannaMendelson, researchers for the Anti-Defamation League, the first weekend ofMinutemen events was endorsed by ShawnWalker, spokesman for the neo-Nazi National Alliance, a group that describes illegal immigration as an ‘‘invasion’’ that will cause white people to be a ‘‘minority within the next 50 years.’’25 Internet Web sites for different border vigilante groups show the overlap of the right-wing extremists, theMinutemen, and the military. For example, at Ranchrescue.com, one is greeted with the words: ‘‘Private property first, foremost, and always.’’ The featured image in October 2005 is of a Border Patrol van flanked by two U.S. Army Stryker armored vehicles on the New Mexican border, and the headline reads: ‘‘US Army Deploys Stryker armored vehicles to NM border, apparently in support of Minuteman Project.’’ Beneath this image is a photo of two armed men wearing black ski masks and camouflage clothing, holding a U.S. flag. It’s an ad for Border Rescue Arizona’s Operation Eagle, which seems to be the group’s name for its current mission to ‘‘reclaim’’ the border from ‘‘drug-running terrorists.’’ The vigilante in neoliberal times functions not as a complete renegade but rather in conjunction with, or at least alongside, the government, both entities acting outside the law, in the name of the law, in order to enforce the law. The Border Patrol responds to the Minutemen, and vice versa; after Simcox organized theMinutemen in Arizona, the Border Patrol announced that it would dispatch five hundred new Border Patrol agents to that state.26 Government officials, as cited above, support the vigilantes. A climate is created in which the suspension of civil rights seems legitimate. The USA Patriot Act, for example, expands the definition of ‘‘terrorist activity,’’ then gives the government considerable power to detain people linked to any such activity, if the attorney general or his deputy ‘‘has reasonable grounds to believe’’ the person has any links to terrorism. If the person held is charged with any violation at all, such as aminor infraction of immigration law, he or she can be held indefinitely.27 The judicial system has assisted in creating camplike conditions of extended detention where detainees have virtually no rights. Agamben argues that the passage of the Patriot Act reveals the extent to which the state of exception has become permanent, for under it individuals have no legal status, thus ‘‘producing a legally unnamable and unclassifiable being’’ subject to a ‘‘detention that is indefinite not only in the temporal sense but in its very nature as well, since it is entirely removed from the law and from judicial oversight,’’28 a situation made visible at sites such as Guantánamo Bay. Along the border there are growing numbers of detention centers; many of them are contracted out to private entities and are becoming the mainstays of local economies. Security and Economy At the intersections of security and economy lies the truth of neoliberalism’s defense of the powerful. Any attempt to prevent ‘‘terrorists’’ from entering the United States must not infringe on corporate profits. When he was head of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge declared: ‘‘Mexico is one of our largest trading partners and it is absolutely critical that we prevent terrorists from infiltrating the commercial chain to launch an attack.’’29 This statement is a slightly balder version of the concerns expressed by the House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Infrastructure and Border Security, which held hearings on this matter in 2003 and summarized their goal: to figure out ‘‘how to balance security enhancements with the flow of people and commerce across our borders. The global trading system is increasingly reliant on the swift delivery of goods produced overseas. America’s economic stability requires that goods and people cross our borders in and out of the country regularly without long delays. Our security also requires that we know who and what is entering.’’30 The United States needs Mexico’s cooperation in negotiating commerce and security; the two countries reached a ‘‘smart border’’ agreement, for example, which included measures such as the Secure Electronic Network for Traveler’s Rapid Inspections, a system that allows the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection to accelerate the inspections of low-risk pre-enrolled crossers (see Payan’s article for a critique of this system). Given its reliance on the maquiladora industry, Mexico has had little choice but to work with the United States on border control as well as launching its own Operativo Sentinela, sending 18,000 soldiers as well as its navy to protect air and sea ports, borders, and key infrastructure and tourist spots. All this could have been averted, fromMexico’s point of view. As one of the rotating members of the United Nations Security Council, Mexico staunchly opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq—along with China, France, Germany, and Russia. Gustavo Carvajal Moreno, president of the Mexican congressional foreign affairs committee, ‘‘pointed out that U.S. vulnerability to external attacks should have counseled against any unilateral action against Iraq. . . . Because of our shared border, such action and possible retaliation against the U.S. made us vulnerable too.’’31 The Security Council passed a resolution saying that Iraq was in ‘‘material breach’’ of previous resolutions, authorizing a new inspection, and reiterating a warning of ‘‘serious consequences’’ if Iraq would not comply with disarmament requirements. Military action should be a last resort. The United States insisted that inspections would not work and pressed ahead. Mexico’s foreign minister, Luis Ernesto Derbez, presciently called into question U.S. claims linking Hussein and al-Qaeda.32 All of these entreaties, obviously, went unheard by a U.S. government determined to invade Iraq. Security is in fact an economic issue, but not just in terms of U.S. wealth. This was the case made by Mexican ambassador Ruiz Cabanas at a 2003 forum of the Organization of American States in Barbados. He argued for ‘‘emphasizing the geographical and thematic diffusion of security threats born out of political, economic, public health, and environment conditions in the hemisphere’’ and ‘‘reminded his audience that ‘human security’ had become an essential element of hemispheric security.’’33 As long as there is poverty throughout Latin America, produced in no small part through the policies of neoliberalism, people will not be secure: Their lives are in a constant state of insecurity and uncertainty about their next meal, their next doctor visit, and the safety of their drinking water. These issues cannot be addressed purely through military means, warns Carmen Moreno, former Mexican ambassador to the OAS, given the devastating history of military intervention: ‘‘This is not a good idea, especially if we consider the strength of the armed forces in relation to the fragility of democracy in some OAS countries.’’34 When the U.S.-Mexico border becomes a normalized state of exception, the U.S. government finds it easier to expand the very contours of the border, again in the name of national security. The House of Representatives subcommittee report quoted above said that one component of the U.S. strategy to build ‘‘smarter borders’’ is through ‘‘pushing our borders out, pushing our zone of security out beyond our physical borders so America’s borders are not the last line of defense, nor the first line of defense, against terrorism.’’35 Mexico becomes the permeable barrier between the United States and the rest of Latin America, a purported breeding ground for terrorists; history repeats itself with the variation that Middle East terrorists (Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda) replace the ‘‘communist threat’’ of the Sandinistas, the FMLN in El Salvador, and other leftist movements—or, rather, that they all join together. There is already considerable evidence to show that the United States is using 9/11 as a rationale for weakening what Moreno calls the fragile democracies that are recovering after decades of brutal military rule in many Latin American countries. In El Salvador in 2004, for example, the campaign of former FMLN guerrilla and presidential candidate Shafik Handal was weakened when the State Department suggested that he had ties to international terrorism and that if he won, the United States would consider El Salvador to be supporting international terrorism, ‘‘thereby blocking all financial remittances made by Salvadorans working in the U.S.’’36 Handal was subsequently defeated by the conservative ARENA Party—which was responsible for many of the death-squad killings in the 1980s. U.S. conservatives have also tried to link Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Lula da Silva in Brazil to ‘‘international terrorism.’’ The Bush administration has adopted an ‘‘Effective Strategy Doctrine’’ that says ‘‘vast ‘ungoverned spaces’ in Latin American nations provide fertile ground for terrorists to take root,’’ and it has used this notion of ungoverned spaces to legitimate a 52 percent jump in the number of Latin American police and soldiers trained by the U.S. military between 2002 and 2003.37 With all of that ‘‘ungoverned space’’ to bring under control, the U.S. government is warranted, it appears to the wider public, in turning to the Minutemen and other vigilante groups who will help maintain the U.S.-Mexico border as a governed space, the ‘‘last frontier’’ in what Agamben calls a ‘‘global civil war.’’38 Resistance arises from within the discourses and material conditions of neoliberalism, as many of the articles here describe. The Ni Una Mas movement based in Ciudad Juárez protests the murders of hundreds of women, many of them maquiladora workers, as Melissa Wright describes in her analysis of the restraints of operating within the world of nongovernmental organizations. Transnational communities represent the possibilities carved out of global flows, as migrants persist in the face of xenophobia and economic hardships, Laura Lewis shows. Numerous poets and artists along the border have articulated the everyday lives of border residents as alternative narratives to the discourse of neoliberalism; these narratives are analyzed here in the essays by Sadowski-Smith,Camacho Schmidt, and Manzanas Calvo. Finally, this issue offers original cultural production that represents the variegated life of the border in the autobiographical essay by Santiago Vaquera-Vásquez, the poetry of Arturo Dávila, and the photography of Alejandro Lugo. While resistance cannot escape the terms of neoliberalism, then, rearticulation is possible and indeed necessary for the imagining of a new—more just and life-sustaining—configuration of the U.S.-Mexico border.
The tech bubble doesn't exist.∂ That's the point of a 53-slide presentation last month in which three partners from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz supplied evidence that the tech market is nowhere near the mania levels of 1999 and 2000.∂ Andreessen Horowitz's data show that private and public funding for tech companies remains at about 40 percent of what it was in 1999. There's been no surge in venture capital fundraising. It's rising but still below 2006 levels.

China condemned America's human-rights record on Thursday, alluding to the White House campaign and suggesting that "money politics and family politics went from bad to worse." The broadside came amid heightening tensions in the South China Sea where the U.S. is conducting war games with the Philippines to counter China's maritime claims. China's document was prepared by a Cabinet office and was released by the state-run Xinhua News Agency. It was a response to a global human-rights survey issued Wednesday by the State Department which criticized China and other countries. The U.S. report cited China's "particularly severe" crackdown on the legal community and "extralegal measures" of enforced disappearances and house arrest against government critics. "The United States made comments on the human-rights situation in many countries while being tight-lipped about its own terrible human-rights record and showing not a bit of intention to reflect on it," Xinhua said. "Since the U.S. government refused to hold up a mirror to look at itself, it has to be done with other people's help." China alleged the "wanton infringement" of civil rights and "rampant gun-related crimes" in the United States, citing a toll of 13,136 killed and 26,493 injured by gun violence last year. Xinhua said 965 people had shot dead by U.S. police. "The frequent occurrence of shooting incidents was the deepest impression left to the world concerning the United States in 2015," the news agency said. It added that 560,000 people were homeless and said that 33 million Americans didn't have health insurance. The report has tallied more than 6,000 airstrikes in Syria and Iraq, allegedly causing "between 1,695 and 2,239" civilian deaths. Xinhua's report attracted attention on China's Twitter-like Weibo social network. "China and the U.S. quarrel about human rights every year which makes them look like little kids," one user wrote. "If America has no human rights, why are rich Chinese going there?" another asked.
Advocates of this reform mean well, and certainly it could be expected to do a significant amount of short-term good by extending a lifeline to students who need choice. The long-term cost of selling out our principles for a quick fix, however, would be high. Let’s start where all public policy ought to start, but where almost none does start these days—with the U.S. Constitution. One of the key weaknesses of the Constitution from the very start was its inadequate clarity about the division of power between federal, state, and local governments. This weak point grew into a fatal flaw in 1913 with the 17th Amendment, which eliminated the only effective check on the growth of federal power: the election of U.S. Senators by state legislatures rather than by popular vote. Title I portability would take advantage of, and thereby strengthen, one of the most important ways in which the federal government tramples on federalism: grant programs. In almost every area of policy, from education to poverty to medicine to police, the federal government saps state and local control by offering states and localities funding. These funds come with strings attached, putting the federal government in the driver’s seat. I speak with some urgency on this issue because I have repented from this kind of thinking myself. When the No Child Left Behind law was first enacted, I supported it because I figured: “As long as the federal government is going to send huge piles of money to the states for education anyway—and it will—we might as well get something good in return.” I have come to see why that argument is wrong. The real problem is not where the money goes but where the money comes from. If the federal government found a giant pot of leprechaun’s gold every year, so that the only question was how to use the money, it might be worth discussing whether some of that money should go to the states. But that’s not how things work. The federal government gets the money for Title I and other federal grant programs by taking it from the states by taxing their citizens. Each state has a limited tax base; its citizens can only pay so much in taxes (a lesson we all learned from Arthur Laffer a generation ago). Higher federal taxes reduce the ability of states and localities to raise their own tax revenue. We gave the federal government the power to tax us in order to fund federal programs—like the military, the State Department, the Supreme Court, national cash-for-clunkers buybacks, and stimulus programs that feed cocaine to monkeys. If the federal government can tax the citizens of the states in order to fund state programs, imposing its own mandates as a condition of receiving the funds, then we no longer really have state governments. The states are just administrative departments of the federal government.
Similarly, at the center of the analysis in this chapter is a concern with the fixation social science research has exhibited in eliciting pain stories from com- munities that are not White, not wealthy, and not straight. Academe's demonstrated fascination with telling and retelling narratives of pain is troubling, both for its voyeurism and for its consumptive implacability. Imagining "itself to be a voice, and in some disciplinary iterations, the voice of the colonised" (Simpson, 2007, p. 67, emphasis in the original) is not just a rare historical occurrence in anthropology and related fields. We observe that much of the work of the academy is to reproduce stories of oppression in its own voice. At first, this may read as an intolerant condemnation of the academy, one that refuses to forgive past blunders and see how things have changed in recent decades. However, it is our view that while many individual scholars have chosen to pursue other lines of inquiry than the pain narratives typical of their disciplines, novice researchers emerge from doctoral programs eager to launch pain-based inquiry projects because they believe that such approaches embody what it means to do social science. The collection of pain narratives and the theories of change that champion the value of such narratives are so prevalent in the social sciences that one might surmise that they are indeed what the academy is about.
China’s economic growth has driven and been fuelled by a large energy requirement. It is questionable whether China can stop this pattern of demand for fossil energy through changes to its economic structure, with findings in recent years indicating sustained and rapid growth in China’s energy demand [21–29]. This outlook is unlikely to change even considering anthropogenic climate change in the long term, although a potential for the reduction of the impact through an improved energy mix, industrial structural adjustments and enhanced technological developments cannot be rejected [30]. Concurrently, significant  energy is still  required to support further economic growth. Thus, the peak of energy consumption is expected to occur later than the peak production year for both oil [31] and coal [10]. Two observations can further illuminate this phenomenon. The first is the rapid expansion of China’s automobile fleet. Fast economic development has brought continuous improvement in people’s living standards, and these rising living standards manifest themselves in a booming demand for automobiles. Over the last 10 years, the total number of civil vehicles increased from 20.5 million in 2002 to 120.9 million in 2012 with an average annual growth rate of 19.4%. Among these, the total number of registered private vehicles increased from 9.7 million to 93.1 million with an average annual growth rate of 25.4% over the same period   [32]. China’s GDP per capita has already reached over 6700 USD in 2013, permitting a growing medium-high and medium income population to acquire and use automobiles. Transportation will continue to consume more energy, especially oil, since other forms of energy cannot yet substitute for oil as a transportation fuel at the scope and scale required. The second observation relates to the heterogeneous levels of economic development witnessed throughout China. In a vast country such as China, there are both historic and geographic reasons for regional differences in economic development [33–35]. Some eastern regions of China have already entered a stage of economic development comparable to moderately-developed countries, presenting a gradually stabilized energy consumption trend. In contrast, the majority of the central and western regions are still undergoing extensive economic growth. These regions reflect the initial stages of industrialization focused on low-level construction/manufacturing, typical of patterns of earlier industrialization in the eastern areas of China. Therefore, China’s energy consumption and energy-related CO2 emissions have different profiles depending on the region being examined [36]. Since the regional difference in economic development in China is considerable, demand could be expected to rise dramatically as standards of living rise in areas of low GDP per capita [37]. 2.3. Environmental Concerns There are many key environmental impacts attributable to energy production and consumption, including anthropogenic climate change, particulate emissions and water pollution. Energy production and consumption have become one of the main reasons for environmental deterioration in China. In recent years, serious haze has become the dominant environmental issue for not only the government, but also the Chinese public [38].   Most  air pollution in China results from coal combustion, which is the source of 90% of SO2 emissions, 70% of dust emissions and 67% of NOx emissions [39]. A coal-dominated energy structure is the major reason for this atmospheric pollution [40]. Anthropogenic global warming is perhaps the most important global issue of the 21st century [41], and nearly 72.5% of China’s total CO2 emissions were from coal in 2010 [40]. Coal will continue to dominate China’s energy consumption and production system in the foreseeable future, challenging the government in its pursuit of a greenhouse gas abatement policy in the short-to-medium term [42]. On the international stage, this makes China appear to be one of the main perpetrators of anthropogenic global warming and places the nation’s diplomats in a tough position caught between demands to decarbonize and domestic calls for more energy to sustain economic development. Developing alternative energy is certainly an option in theory, but will take time and significant investment to realize the benefits [43]. Moreover, China’s use of coal for construction minerals (cement and steel) is currently exceedingly difficult to substitute for renewable alternatives anywhere in the world; thus, these key materials of development are almost unavoidable emitters of greenhouse gases [44]. China’s national energy policy has also plunged its renewable industrial development into a passive state [45]. Recent amendments to this policy have mitigated some of the problems [46], although it is still too early to fully evaluate the effectiveness of these changes in promoting non-fossil energy sources. According to the Chinese government’s renewable energy medium- and long-term development plans [47], non-fossil fuel energy will account for 15% of total energy use in 2020. Even if this target can be achieved successfully, fossil fuels will still be the main source for China’s energy consumption mix. Depletion of conventional fossil fuels can potentially trigger increased economic pressure to develop unconventional hydrocarbon resources, ranging from shale gas to oil sands. However, the EROI is less for these resources, and hence, the carbon footprint is also higher than more conventional hydrocarbon sources, making the emission problem even worse [48]. It is likely that unconventional oil and gas will be affected by future climate change mitigation initiatives [49].
“The more important the military-industrial complex is within a country, the more likely it is that the nation state will act as a protector of its military rather than as a protector of the biosphere,” writes Matthias Finger in The Ecologist. “Where the military can appear to be environmentally ‘useful,’ environmental degradation will increase the relative importance of the military-industrial complex within each state, which in turn will perpetuate military pollution, which will raise global environmental security concerns and so further strengthen the military.” For Finger, “the military must be addressed as a cause and not a cure of global environmental problems.” Sooner or later, this analyst believes, “the military-industrial complex must be dismantled. This is the sine qua non for effectively dealing with the entire global environmental crisis.” Cindy Millstein of the US-based Left Green Network thinks that the UN’s Green Beret proposal could create environmental superpowers that profit from the military’s degradation of environment. Major Britt-Theorin replies that the environmental response teams would be assembled and answerable to the UN. General Assembly comprised of all member nations, rather than the Security Council of the superpowers. Developing countries, she explains, would retain a major voice in implementing the resolution. If the Swedish government was seriously backing Britt-Theorin’s proposal, Jonas Olsson of the Swedish-based Cooperation for Peace suggests, it could start by reallocating army facilities to restore 20,000 acidified lakes in the country.   Who calls the shots in the mounting eco wars? Even if a civilian agency of the UN undertakes the task of providing worldwide environmental security, credibility is crucial when attempting to resolve disputes involving water allocation and trans-border pollution.
There are moments, even in highly polarized political times, when the center holds – and counts. This week’s Senate vote on a massive economic recovery plan is one such moment. Three Republican centrists – the remnant of a once-robust moderate wing of their party – are poised to give Democrats the last few votes they need to pass President Obama’s $800 billion-plus stimulus plan in the Senate. With a handful of GOP colleagues, they are the likely “swing votes” that could make or break legislation in the Congress for the first years of the Obama administration. It’s a bare working majority. But if the relationship develops, it allows the president to go forward largely without regard to majority conservative views in the GOP caucus. Democrats shy of votes Even with a majority of 58 in the Senate (with one recount pending), Democrats are shy of the 60 votes needed to move major legislation. That’s why Republican moderates like Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania are so crucial to the new president’s agenda.
In a crisis or conflict, the PLA could adopt a much higher intensity—and potentially very dangerous— approach to deterrence operations, such as by increasing the readiness level of its strategic missile force, displaying its nuclear, long-range conventional strike or anti-satellite weapons to send a deterrence signal, conducting nuclear or conventional missile test launches, or even conducting information attacks or limited conventional strikes designed to compel an adversary to submit to Chinese demands.
The narrative developed by Foucault in these lectures is more fractious and detailed that I am portraying. The canvass that Foucault is panting in these lectures concerns not just the wars that gave birth to our society, and its novel forms of knowledge, it also concerns something which I find fascinating, and provocative: the invention of a people. To counter and challenge the power of the invaders, as well as the power of popes and kings, and using the narratives to unmask their acts of usurpation and tyranny, elements within a social body begin to appeal to the ideas of a people, which then refers to a race, which then refers to a populations, and then is enshrined in the anodyne notion of “society.” From a Foucauldian perspective, the objects of scientific study are partly constituted by the disciplines that seek to study them. So, just as psychiatry produces the madman, and sexology the sexual deviant, and so on, political theory in conjunction with historical discourse, produces a people. But the discourse of political rationality that emerged since the sixteenth century does not secrete a univocal idea of a people. As the political rationality of the modern state develops and grows in intensity, as it augments its claims to power, a people becomes a nation, becomes a population, becomes a biological phenomenon to be tended by all the sciences at the service of the state. Analogously to how sexuality became the locus of the production of control, insofar as it was the pivot of interaction between individuals and their surrounding social environment, race also became the pivot around which the biopower state came to exert its claims, so as to be able to produce certain power effects. What is provocative here is the link that Foucault establishes between the emergence of biopower and the constitution of something that we have now become accustomed to calling society, by which we in fact mean a population, a people, a particular nation. For Foucault the emergence of political rationality is directly linked to the constitution of the object over which it must act. And here I am able to foreground one of the central lessons of these lectures, namely that political theory has to attend to the emergence of political rationality in terms not of its rationality, or claims to reason, but in terms of its modalities of operation. Behind political rationality does not stand reason, or rather, reason is not the alibi of political rationality; instead, political rationality has to do with the horizon of its enactment. If we accept that Foucault is a historical nominalist, and he is a nominalist through and through, in the way that Rorty reads him, and correctly I would argue, then there is no reason behind political power. Political power itself cannot be mystified. There is no power without the horizon of its enactment and the vehicles of its transmission. This is still a misleading way of putting. The effects produced by a certain way of organizing the social body, of studying it, of policing it, of taking care of it, of making sure that its health and protection are attended to in the most detailed and careful ways possible, produce a confrontation of forces, whose momentary stalemates, clashes, subjugations and dispersal, are summarized in the name of power. And that power is the power over life. The political rationality of the modern state is above all a rationality grounded in the way it tends to the life of the population. The power of the biopolitical state is a regulation of life, a tending, a nurturing and management of the living. The political rationality of the modern total state is management of the living body of the people. This logic was epitomized in the paroxysm of the Nazi state, but also in the communist states, with their Gulags.
.Perhaps the only good reason to hesitate before ordering an attack on North Korea is China. But that’s not because Beijing would intervene against the United States. The notion that China is North Korea’s all-around protector is badly out of date. Yes, the Chinese do not want to see North Korea disappear with U.S. troops moving up to the Yalu River and China’s border. But President Xi Jinping’s support for maximum economic sanctions, including a de facto blockade of oil imports — a classic act of war — amounts to a change of sides when it comes to North Korean nuclear weapons. Anybody who believes China would act on North Korea’s behalf in the event of an American attack against its nuclear installations has not been paying attention.
The report finds "no indication that the Cuban government provided weapons or paramilitary training to terrorist groups."¶   Countries listed by the State Department as state sponsors of terrorism face economic and political sanctions, including U.S. opposition to any aid from the International Monetary Fund and other major financial institutions.¶ The report says there was a sharp uptick in Iran's sponsorship of terrorism around the world, including attacks or attempted attacks in India, Thailand, Georgia and Kenya.¶ Critics contend that Cuba's inclusion on the list is not justified and reflects the views of members of Congress who are fiercely opposed to the communist leaders in Havana. State Department officials are not considering delisting Cuba, which has been under a U.S. economic embargo since 1962.¶ "The report makes it clear that the State Department doesn't really believe that Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism," said Geoff Thale, program director at the Washington Office on Latin America, a liberal advocacy group. "Cuba is clearly on the terrorist list for political reasons."¶ Cuba still shelters about two dozen members of the separatist group Basque Homeland and Freedom, or ETA, one of the groups on the terrorist list, according to the report. But Havana has been reducing its support for the group and no longer provides it with travel documents, the report says.¶ Cuba also has provided haven for members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, another organization on the terrorist list. But in November, Cuba began hosting peace talks between the Colombian government and the rebels.¶   Washington had faulted Cuba for doing too little to prevent money laundering and international terrorist financing. But last year Cuba joined the Financial Action Task Force of South America, an intergovernmental group that seeks to enforce U.S.-supported standards on such illicit activities.¶ Cuba's shift reflects changes in the country's leadership and a preoccupation with domestic economic problems, analysts say.
In the wake of the 1995–1996 Strait crisis, three views appeared in the United States. The first view argues that the U.S. military should intervene into military conflicts under any circumstances. This view carries a Cold War mind-set, being addicted to the Taiwan card, however "wild" it is. The second view argues that Washington should make a conditional commitment to Taiwan's security, never fighting with the mainland for the sake of Taiwanese independence. The third view argues that the United States should clearly stay outside of the mainland-Taiwan conflict, as advocated by Cato Institute Vice Director Ted Galen Carpenter in 2006.19 As Cato embraces libertarianism and advocates noninterventionism in foreign policy, Carpenter's argument was quite unique in Washington, DC. It has, however, prepared a basic tune for the voice of "Taiwan abandonment" uttered between 2009 and 2014. Former Vice Chairman of U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Bill Owens wrote an article in Financial Times in November 2009, arguing that China would become a great power equal to the United States within 30 years. "The solution is to approach the US/China relationship not with hedging, competition or watchfulness, but with co-operation, openness and trust." For him, Washington should have a thoughtful review of the implementation of the TRA and other outdated legislation.20 Meanwhile, Peterson Institute of International Economics Director Fred Bergsten used G-2 to describe the leadership of the two countries in overcoming the world economic crisis.21 While both Taiwan abandonment and G-2 are beyond the mainstream in American academic circles, these arguments have illustrated an internal tension between U.S.-China strategic cooperation in the world and Americans' commitment to Taiwan's security. Consequently, an increasing number of American scholars and policy advisors have begun to accept the argument of "Taiwan abandonment" or considered readjusting U.S. Taiwan policy, as a result of the reducing gap in national strength between China and the United States as well as the growing prospects of their cooperation, peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, and the declining capacities of Taiwan.22 In regard to Taiwan abandonment, there are two groups of people. The first group argues that the United States should get out of Taiwan affairs. For people in favor of this perspective, because of the narrowing gap between the United States and China economically and militarily and the expanding gap between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan in both [End Page 184] spheres, Taiwan should not remain as an unstable root of tensions between Washington and Beijing. If the United States continues to support Taiwan in the last stage of the Chinese civil war, it will face a series of negative implications. As David Shambaugh has argued, the game between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is over. Since Taiwan cannot escape from the mainland's control, Washington should abandon Taiwan as early as possible.23 Chas Freeman argues that the long friendship and cooperation between the United States and the Chinese mainland are far more important than Americans' special sentiments to Taiwan; the best policy therefore is to accept China's reunification.24 Former U.S. ambassador to China Joseph Prueher argues that even if America continues to provide arms sales to Taiwan, the island cannot defend itself. Charles Glaser considers Taiwan as a strategic liability of the United States. Because Taiwan's leader may bring America into a war with China, which has developed its regular and strategic nuclear forces quickly, Washington should gradually free itself from Taiwan affairs to avoid falling into a longtime hostility with a rising China.25 Like Owens, both Prueher and Glaser agree that the United States should review the TRA and the arms sales issues.26 According to Bruce Gilley, if Taiwan can maintain autonomy and democracy, getting rid of its role as a strategic partner of the United States through Finlandization, it will be good news for the American government who is increasingly seeking China's cooperation; Washington does not need to include Taiwan into its strategic orbit.27 More bluntly, Paul Kane even suggests the Obama administration negotiate with the Chinese government behind doors to cancel American debt of $1.14 trillion to China by ending arms sales and military assistance to Taiwan.28 From a realist perspective, John Mearsheimer argues that if China continues to grow dramatically, Taiwan seems doomed to become part of China, and the United States has to say goodbye to Taiwan. For Mearsheimer, "at some point in the next decade or so, it will become impossible for the United States to help Taiwan defend itself against a Chinese attack." The price of close relations between the United States and Taiwan will overtake the interest America can gain. It is doubtful how long Washington will consider Taiwan as a strategic asset.29 For him, Taiwan abandonment is undesirable, but it may eventually become a reality that the United States has to accept. As Michael Swaine argues, as the United States cannot maintain dominance in East Asia and commitment to Taiwan's security in the long run, it should soon begin to consider negotiation with the Chinese mainland, reducing both parties' [End Page 185] military projection in the Taiwan Strait and revising the Six Assurances so that the two sides of the strait can eventually move to political dialogue.30 Another group of people tend to give a free hand to China's peaceful unification as U.S. officials did during the most part of the 1970s and the early 1980s mentioned above. With the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and strengthening of China-U.S. strategic cooperation over the past years, a growing number of American experts have begun to explore the possibility of China's peaceful unification as well as the specific formulas for it. According to former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, because of the decline of American national capacity and the growing need for U.S.-China strategic cooperation, arms sales to Taiwan can only increase unnecessary hostility from the Chinese mainland. According to him, Taiwan should accept a more flexible unification model like "one country, multiple systems" rather than "one country, two systems" and thus reduce its reliance on the United States.31 Interestingly, his argument in 2012 was quite consistent with what he made in an official capacity three decades earlier. Similarly, U.S. military expert Michael McDevitt pointed out that if China was reunified, it would be the "best outcome for better Sino-U.S. relations" because it could "bring closure to U.S. involvement in the Chinese civil war."32 Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Christensen's earlier argument—before he joined the government—is even stronger. For him, peaceful unification is in the U.S. interest, because "the United States has long-term security and moral interests in the political liberalization of the mainland." However, "Taiwan's status as a Chinese democracy—holding out the prospect of unification with the mainland under the right set of conditions—can be a powerful force for liberalization on the mainland."33 These arguments explore the desirability of peaceful unification of the two sides from different perspectives. Brzezinski and McDevitt approach the issue more from a realist perspective, that is, to gracefully resolve the structural problem in China-U.S. relations and free Washington from the historical knot on the issue of Taiwan without sacrificing the latter's interest. By contrast, Christensen makes his case more from a liberalist perspective, with a strong ideological flavor, considering Taiwan as a medium promoting the mainland's political liberalization. It is interesting to observe that regardless of whether Taiwan is a historical burden or potential asset for the United States, the major concern of Washington is ironically the mainland rather than Taiwan. In other words, Taiwan is less important than the mainland in U.S. policy reckoning. This group of scholars and experts would not consider themselves as supporters of Taiwan abandonment. After all, peaceful unification is inherent within the U.S. policy guideline of peaceful resolution. However, they consider Taiwan more as a strategic liability than an asset of the United States and disregard peaceful separation as a feasible option. They hope China's unification can occur with Taiwanese agreement so that the United States can gracefully disentangle itself from the historical knot and resolve the structural problem between Washington and Beijing. For them, the political dispute across the Taiwan Strait is the outcome of the Cold War, and the Taiwan issue can be resolved by itself as the two sides move toward political integration through economic integration.
College-educated workers, both native and foreign born, have a positive effect on local economies beyond the direct incomes they earn. By facilitating the adoption of better and more productive technologies and by fostering local learning and increasing local knowledge, college-educated workers positively affect the productivity and average wages of a city.10 Conversely, their departure from local workforces—due to limited visa channels or uncertain immigration status—could lower the productivity and wages of those left behind.
The Communist Party must bridge ideological divides that are driving a wedge between its factions, party analysts have said ahead of a key meeting this month. Academics at the Central Party School have raised eight ideological questions, the answers to which they say will be crucial to the direction of the country's development, according to a report by Shanghai Thinkers Forum, a theoretical journal run by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. The article was also posted on the People's Daily website. The questions revolve around the need to maintain the traditional communist ideology as the party tries to establish a capitalist-style market economy. The issues run from the contradictions between the tenets of socialism and market economics; to how to promote core socialist values; and the need to settle the theory of class struggle. Question marks have also been raised over interpretations of Soviet-era Marxism, modern governance of state affairs, the role of market forces in resource distribution, the coexistence of Marxism and traditional Chinese culture, and the mechanics of a market economy under a centralised government. The article comes as the party prepares for its fourth plenum in Beijing on October 20-23, a gathering expected to cover major political and ideological issues, including the rule of law and judicial reform. The plenum will convene under the leadership of Xi Jinping who, in the two years since becoming general secretary, has launched both anti-corruption and ideological campaigns to "purify" the party to justify its sole rule of the world's most populous nation. The ideological debate is reflected in the wrangle that two leading party publications - Qiushi (Seeking Truth), the party's theoretic journal, and the Study Times, a key product of the Central Party School - have engaged in over late leader chairman Mao Zedong's theory of class struggle. Analysts said this rising debate highlighted the ideological dilemma the party had struggled with since the mainland embarked on market reforms 35 years ago. "This is a very interesting debate. At the core is the Communist Party's difficulty in re-establishing its legitimacy as political and economic conditions change," said Professor Zhiqun Zhu, director of the China Institute at Bucknell University in the United States. Zhu said the debate reflected deep divisions among party officials and scholars, disputes that could widen the party's internal gaps and create opposing political camps. "It may also be conducive to redefining the party's very identity in the 21st century and lead to the transformation of the party [into one] that will become more politically open and tolerant." Xigen Li, an associate professor at City University's department of media and communication, added: "The issue of ideological correctness and … reality is always a dilemma, which is difficult to resolve under China's current political system." Li said the dilemma and the debates over the ideological issues would continue and have the benefit of bringing the issues to the table for those in power to face seriously. "While ideological emancipation is the final solution - and the dilemma will exist for some time - at least some compromise could be made to solve compelling issues in economic development rationally and efficiently," Li said.
Some parents consciously choose to not have their children vaccinated, to delay vaccination, or to use alternative immunization schedules.6,9 This has caused a resurgence of many infectious diseases due to the loss of herd immunity, which puts many communities at risk.6,14 Vaccination is compulsory for school-age children in the U.S.; however, public health officials are increasingly fearful of the option for parents to claim exemptions from vaccination requirements.9 Because of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease, rising attention has been focused on vaccine hesitancy, causing some state legislatures to enact new vaccine exemption laws.15 Currently, exemptions are allowed due to medical reasons in all states; religious grounds in 48 states; and philosophical objections in 20 states.9,16 It has been estimated that 1% to 3% of children are excused from immunization because of these exemptions, but in some communities the exemption rate is as high as 20%.9 Even when a low percentage of children are excused from immunization, the risk of disease outbreaks in schools with exemption rates as low as 2% to 4% increases.9 Illustratively, in southern Pennsylvania, health care providers have frequently expressed frustration with morbidity and mortality from preventable infectious diseases that are traced to many Amish parents’ decisions not to have their children immunized.9
The US-China agreements are important in their own right, as they aim to prevent crises and defuse tensions between the two superpowers, but they may also serve as models for future military agreements, such as those that are currently being built between China and Japan for managing the Senkaku Islands dispute in the East China Sea. In the month of January, Chinese and Japanese officials met through two different channels. One set of bilateral military talks met to establish China-Japan maritime and air crisis communication mechanisms. Another high-level consultation included all relevant maritime organizations on both sides, and established several working groups to increase dialogue between the two countries on East China Sea issues. China and Japan initially agreed to pursue an East China Sea crisis mechanism in 2012, but got nowhere after tensions spiked over the Senkakus in September of that year. The fact that talks have resumed and progress is being made can only be a positive sign, argues Tetsuo Kotani. Yet as both he and Zhu Feng argue, many challenges lie ahead for these ties.
Their struggle with the state is manifest in their ongoing debate and discussion around a membership law within their community. This registers as a conflict and a crisis, as something eventful rather than structural. My argument is that it is a sign, also, of colonialism’s ongoing existence and simultaneous failure. Colonialism survives in a settler form. In this form, it fails at what it is supposed to do: eliminate Indigenous people; take all their land; absorb them into a white, property-owning body politic. Kahnawà:ke’s debates over membership index colonialism’s life as well its failure and their own life through their grip on this failure.
For the most part, they agree on the issue of terrorism. Although American leaders regularly denounce terrorism as the modern world’s greatest plague, most don’t see it as a major challenge. Last November, former State Department official Daniel Serwer warned, “We shouldn’t blow up terrorism into an existential threat. It’s not.” A month later, Obama agreed that ISIS and other groups stand no real chance of defeating the United States. “Today’s terrorists can kill innocent people,” Obama stated, “but they don’t pose an existential threat to our nation.” Instead, officials have grown more concerned about other challenges. Taking a more traditional view of the world, they have largely concluded that rising powers in the international system now pose the most serious threat to US hegemony.
Which brings up an interesting question: How did the wildcatters, the state, the environmentalists, Congress, and anybody else who cares about oil and Arctic ecosystems decide to give up drilling on land in the far north and instead head dozens of miles into the Arctic Ocean to hunt for oil? Should there have been a choice between the two? In far northern Alaska, there are no deepwater ports, no nearby pipelines to those offshore oil prospects, no fully staffed offices for regulators to keep watch -- there’s nothing resembling the oil-spill response infrastructure you’d find elsewhere in the United States. Meantime, on state land at Prudhoe Bay and other North Slope oil fields, there is a maze of infrastructure, along with a 40-year-plus history of managing onshore oil development. And not so far away from all of this sits an undeveloped oil patch estimated to hold billions of barrels of crude. And it’s on land -- not 60 miles offshore. It is called the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and it’s managed by the feds, just like the waters where Shell is drilling in the Arctic Ocean. There was a time when drilling on ANWR’s coastal plain was among the biggest environmental debates of our time. It spawned a cottage industry that grew around either protecting or developing that tundra. Americans were inundated, sometimes deceptively, with images of the “last untouched wilderness,” caribou running free against the backdrop of snow-capped mountains. There are actually no snow-capped mountains in the area where drilling would happen in ANWR. And the caribou that migrate where onshore drilling is currently taking place to the west have not seemed to be hurting. Most important is that ANWR sits on solid ground (actually covered in snow a good part of the year) where an oil spill would be comparatively easy to handle than out at sea. In contrast, a spill in the Arctic Ocean would be a devastating mess, no matter what Shell executives say they’ve done to prevent such a disaster or their plans to respond to such a scenario. Environmental groups have tried to prevent drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. But compared to their decades-long ANWR battle, this fight has seemed anemic. Perhaps the groups knew that offshore Arctic drilling was inevitable. Or perhaps the fight doesn’t provide for the kind of picturesque-fundraising that has done so well for them for so many years in the ANWR battle. Or maybe they were too focused on ANWR and too late in waging an offshore war. The drill bit is turning in the Chukchi Sea, so the question is probably just theoretical. But if we could roll back the clock, how would we manage Arctic oil development today in a post-Deepwater Horizon world? If politicians, oil executives and environmentalists were asked today to make a choice between drilling in ANWR or in the Arctic Ocean, which would they choose? Alaskans, which would you choose? It's your back yard. Did anybody ever ask you?
At the heart of the debate around neoliberalism in environmental governance is the balance between the state and the market and the rise of the market in the last few decades shows just how powerful it has become through the processes of deregulation and globalisation. This has happened not without its inequalities as well as wealth generation. Neoliberal capitalism is a system of booms and busts and despite its creation of crises, it has an astounding capacity to turn around and profit from them, (Klein, XXXX). With regards to the environmental crisis and climate change, this is still to be seen but is argued, as above, that the commodification of nature will again be an example of neoliberalism's dynamic capacity to manage crisis. It is not necessarily a case of market or state, but a nuanced balance between the two – societies are more than their political leaders and their markets and the environment plays an integral role in everyone's lives, as well as making all life possible at all. It therefore must be valued above its destruction and attributing monetary value can stop it from being taken for granted. However, there are limits to scientific rationality and measurement, (Robertson, 2004; 2006), and nature has value beyond its potential use but intrinsic value is hard to measure, if not impossible outside of the close approximations to beauty within the arts. Due to the overwhelming threat of potential loss of nature posed by business-as-usual development, eco-centric views have paradoxically disappeared, subsumed by the vast ideological power tied to control, identity and culture of the Western capitalist system that has dominated global politics and whose discourse is anthropocentric and calculable in monetary terms. This anthropocentric translation of nature is purportedly more efficient, encouraging of innovation and more costeffective than traditional regulation, (Jordan et al, 2003). As decision-making within all other areas of governance are also heavily weighted by economics, commodifying nature allows for levelpegging within that deliberation and has already proved valuable in the Stern Review with regards to the climate change debate. Pricing also opens up opportunities for new trade and investment. Therefore, going green will succeed - as with all things in the market (unless given vast bail-outs from the public) - if it is profitable. Yet one must ask if turning crisis into profit is enough, as perhaps there are crises that are best averted, such as tipping points that cannot be undone regardless of any monetary value potential produced by them.
While an impressive figure on its face, what often astounds Americans and Mexicans alike is that Mexico buys more from the United States than the BRICs combined – Brazil, Russia, India and China. As cited by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 6 million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico. This is a border-oriented relationship, yes, given the volume of surface trade, but states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York with export goods such as transportation equipment, metals and jewelry, also benefit greatly from the growing consumer base of the U.S.’s southern neighbor. According to the Woodrow Wilson Center, 25 cents of every dollar of imported goods from Canada to the U.S. is “Made in USA” content, and the figure is 40 cents of every dollar for goods imported from Mexico. This indicates that Nafta is creating partners and not competitors among its member countries.¶ As for Mexico’s interest in this bilateral relationship, it can be summarized in two facts: about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports go to the U.S., while 50 percent of the accumulated foreign direct investment received between 2000 and 2011 comes from its northern neighbor. Moreover, Nafta has been the fundamental anchor for reforms that make Mexico a more modern economy and open society.
ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, who spoke Tuesday morning at the Houston energy conference prior to news of Chavez's death, noted how the global energy landscape has changed dramatically.¶ "The new landscape is like someone picked up the energy world and tilted it," he said, as countries with great demand for energy and those with ample supplies has changed. The U.S. is now exporting more of its natural resources than ever before, he said. Those exports include shipping record supplies of US gasoline to Venezuela. Meanwhile Venezuela oil exports to the U.S. are on the decline.¶ Sira said Venezuela could produce as much as 6 to 9 million barrels of oil a day but now it's probably less than 2.5 million barrels. He said oil production peaked in the early year at 3.3 million barrels. (Read More: Why Venezuela's World-Beating Oil Reserves Are 'Irrelevant') Venezuela ranked fourth in oil imports to the U.S. last year at 906,000 barrels per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). But crude oil imports from Venezuela have been declining steadily since 2004, when they peaked at 1.3 million barrels per day.
This section is a study of the interplay between the performative, border epistemologies of two Chicano/a imaginative writers and the changing discourses of American vernacular literatures and cultures. Gloria Anzaldúa’s and Victor Martínez’s writings about U.S. Latino/a life explore, among other things, the linguistic intermixture of ethnic and mainstream languages (English, Spanish, and Spanglish) to illustrate the changing languages of America. What vernacular varieties of English or Spanish will dominate in twenty-first-century America? Which lingua rustica will the some 30 million U.S. Latinos/as (with more than 10 million in California) hegemonize in their testimonios, novels, essays, and poetry? What new literary genres, produced by Chicanos/as, will emerge in American literature? If the ‘‘dialect novel’’ was all the rage in late-nineteenth-century vernacular America (Mark Twain, George W. Cable, Abraham Cahan, W. E. B. Du Bois), Ω is there a borderlands English or Spanglish already under way in U.S. Latino/a-dominant California, Arizona, Florida, Texas, Illinois, and New York? On another level, I want to investigate the enabling condition of some recent Chicano/a narrative and poetry and the various ways in which they seek to create an epistemological ground on which versions of the world may be produced. As many U.S. Latino/a writers themselves suggest, to read is to question and to understand the (bilingual) texture and the rhetorical resources of language. If Anzaldúa sees the aesthetic structure of knowledge as a form of nepantilism, Martínez sees minority writing as a form of the California borderlands of subaltern studies informing mass youth U.S. Latino/a culture. ∞≠ To begin, I juxtapose Anzaldúa’s key concept of U.S.-Mexican border nepantilism against the U.S. historian Frederick Jackson Turner’s well-known nineteenth-century idea of the frontier. I do so to emphasize that while Turner and Anzaldúa may share some affinities of narrative and subaltern conventions and self-locations in the United States— each writer locates stories in a tradition of border historiography— their contrasts, I think, run far deeper, for Turner’s paradigms of the ‘‘frontier’’ and Anzaldúa’s frontera are not equivalent.
Of course, they should. But can they? Since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 in the United States, China has defined almost any dissent from its policies there as examples of international terrorism. It has also consistently tried to win western acquiescence in its suppression of the Uighurs by claiming that all Uighur protests, whether peaceful or violent, against China’s harsh rule in Xinjiang amount to terrorism. For well over a decade, China’s propaganda has identified a group it calls the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, or ETIM, as a main instigator of Uighur violence in China, saying that ETIM has training camps in the borderlands of Afghanistan and Pakistan and is closely linked to al-Qaeda.
In 2007, the Supreme Court made integration even more difficult than it already was, when the Court prohibited the Louisville and Seattle school districts from making racial balance a factor in assigning students to schools, in situations where applicant numbers exceeded available seats (Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 2007). The plurality opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts decreed that student categorization by race (for purposes of administering a choice program) is unconstitutional unless it is designed to reverse effects of explicit rules that segregated students by race. Desegregation efforts, he stated, are impermissible if students are racially isolated, not as the result of government policy but because of societal discrimination, economic characteristics, or what Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurring opinion, termed ‘‘any number of innocent private decisions, including voluntary housing choices.’’ In Roberts’ terminology, commonly accepted by policymakers from across the political spectrum, constitutionally forbidden segregation established by federal, state or local government action is de jure, while racial isolation independent of state action, as, in Roberts’ view, in Louisville and Seattle, is de facto. It is generally accepted today, even by sophisticated policymakers, that black students’ racial isolation is now de facto, with no constitutional remedy—not only in Louisville and Seattle, but in all metropolitan areas, North and South. Even the liberal dissenters in the Louisville-Seattle case, led by Justice Stephen Breyer, agreed with this characterization. Breyer argued that school districts should be permitted voluntarily to address de facto racial homogeneity, even if not constitutionally required to do so. But he accepted that for the most part, Louisville and Seattle schools were not segregated by state action and thus not constitutionally required to desegregate. This is a dubious proposition. Certainly, Northern schools have not been segregated by policies assigning Race Soc Probl (2015) 7:21–30 23 123 blacks to some schools and whites to others—at least not since the 1940s; they are segregated because their neighborhoods are racially homogenous. But neighborhoods did not get that way from ‘‘innocent private decisions’’ or, as the late Justice Potter Stewart once put it, from ‘‘unknown and perhaps unknowable factors such as in-migration, birth rates, economic changes, or cumulative acts of private racial fears’’ (Milliken v. Bradley 1974). In truth, residential segregation’s causes are both knowable and known—twentieth century federal, state and local policies explicitly designed to separate the races and whose effects endure today. In any meaningful sense, neighborhoods and in consequence, schools, have been segregated de jure. The notion of de facto segregation is a myth, although widely accepted in a national consensus that wants to avoid confronting our racial history. The federal government led in the establishment and maintenance of residential segregation in metropolitan areas. From its New Deal inception and especially during and after World War II, federally funded public housing was explicitly racially segregated, both by federal and local governments. Not only in the South, but in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, projects were officially and publicly designated either for whites or for blacks. Some projects were ‘‘integrated’’ with separate buildings designated for whites or for blacks. Later, as white families left the projects for the suburbs, public housing became overwhelmingly black and in most cities was placed only in black neighborhoods, explicitly so. This policy continued one originating in the New Deal, when Harold Ickes, President Roosevelt’s first public housing director, established the ‘‘neighborhood composition rule’’ that public housing should not disturb the preexisting racial composition of neighborhoods where it was placed (Hirsch 1998/1983, p. 14; Hirsch 2000, p. 209; e.g., Hills v. Gautreaux 1976; Rothstein 2012). This was de jure segregation.
Japan is currently leading the charge, which comes as no surprise, as the country has at least 10 years' worth of proven reserves off its coasts and natural gas prices that are four times higher than in the US. As of right now, methane hydrate extraction remains incredibly costly and fairly theoretical, but a successful Japanese extraction test in March led the country to state it would try to have viable extraction operations by 2023. That decade timetable is tight, but Japan's not alone. According to a big report in the Wall Street Journal, India and China are also heavily interested in exploiting methane hydrates to help feed their huge energy demands. (Those energy needs have also fueled Chinese and Indian interest in alternative energy sources like thorium.) Currently, costs remain high—the Journal pegs methane hydrate extraction at somewhere between $30 and $60 per million BTUs, while in the US natural gas is $4 per million BTUs—but experiments are ongoing in Asia and North America.
Contrary to Elshtain’s portrayal, feminist IR does not avoid first-image theorizing, either about human nature or about the role of individuals in global politics. Feminists in IR have consistently claimed the gender lenses offer a unique understanding of the first image.38 Further, feminist arguments for ‘first-image’ significance do not rely on inte­grating women into leadership. Instead, some feminists in IR have understood accounts of human nature that disregard gender as incomplete.39 Feminist scholars also contend that gender affects first-image scholars’ choice of subject when they study ‘man’ or ‘the individual.’40 Finally, feminists provide a link between ‘people’ and ‘the system’ that, instead of relying on adding more women to leadership, understands the international system as interdependent with its most vulnerable members.41 The remainder of this sec­tion goes over each of these contributions to first-image theorizing. The first dimension of first-image theorizing is the question of the role of human nature in global politics. Even the earliest work in feminist IR argued that gender analy-sis matters in the study of human nature in global politics. Tickner, in her 1988 critique of Hans Morgenthau’s principles of political realism, argued that the pessimist view of human nature was ‘rooted in assumption about human nature and morality that, in modern Western culture, are associated with masculinity.’42 Particularly, feminists see the gendered dichotomies of our understandings of human capacities, where masculine– feminine is related to strong–weak, autonomous–interdependent, rational–emotional, competitive–cooperative, and public–private. Feminists observe that, often, realists’ conceptions of human nature privilege the side of these dichotomies associated with masculinity while discounting the characteristics associated with femininity, relying on ‘the social construction of hegemonic masculinity and its opposition to devalued femininity.’43 Tickner explains that, at best, a concept of human nature that privileges traits associated with masculinity only tells a partial story: “A feminist perspective believes that objectivity, as it is culturally defined, is associated with masculinity. Therefore, supposedly ‘objective’ laws of human nature are based on a partial masculine view of human nature. Human nature is both masculine and feminine; it contains elements of social reproduction and development as well as political domination.”44¶ Criticisms of first-image pessimism, however, have not led feminist IR to adopt a liberal individualistic understanding of human nature. Sarah Brown, in another early contribution to feminist IR, argued that such an approach relies on the gendered dichotomy of reason and emotion, awarding individuals political agency and rights on the basis of their ability to reason.45 As a result, liberal approaches to gender are left to ‘roam confusedly between the pursuit of liberty and the pursuit of justice, juggling with incoherent strategies which simultaneously assert women’s sameness to and difference from men.’46 Rejecting both negative and individualistic approaches to human nature, feminist theorists have drawn on women’s experiences and gender analysis to sketch alternative visions. Starting with evidence that sometimes women are assigned obligations that they do not freely assume (contra social contract theorizing), Nancy Hirschmann sees humans as relationally, rather than radically, autonomous, where people maintain individual identity but make choices within the constraints of partial autonomy and human interdependence.47 Tickner proposes a hybrid approach that sees human nature as a combination of characteristics traditionally associated with masculinity and the characteristics associated with femininity that they often overshadow.48 Other feminist scholars, combining these understandings, opt to see human behavior as fluidly connected to dominant (gendered) social norms rather than stabilized by some sort of constant nature.49 Each of these approaches has obvious and potentially important implications for the role of ‘man’ in statecraft and warcraft.
From the Cold War era until recently, most major defense-related technologies were first developed by government-directed programs and later spread to the commercial sector.65 Examples include nuclear technology, the Global Positioning System (GPS), and the internet. In contrast, civilian companies are leading AI development, with DOD adapting their tools after the fact for national security functions. Noting the reversal of the traditional arrangement that has developed over the past decade, one AI expert commented, “It is unusual to have a technology that is so strategically important being developed commercially by a relatively small number of companies.” 66
In the early 2000s, the rate of warming at the Earth’s surface was slower than scientists expected, despite the continued accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. Recent research has shown that natural fluctuations in the Pacific Ocean played an important role in this surface warming “slowdown”. But a new paper, published in Nature Climate Change, suggests these variations in the Pacific Ocean were actually triggered by changing aerosol emissions from human activity – particularly by increases in China’s burning of fossil fuels. The findings suggest that the slowdown in surface warming could have been predicted, the lead author tells Carbon Brief, and that future cuts to aerosol emissions could prompt rapid warming in the coming years. Cooling effect In its latest report, the IPCC calculated that global surface temperatures between 1998 and 2012 rose by 0.05C per decade. Accounting for uncertainty, this is 30-50% slower than the 0.12C per decade increase over the longer period of 1951-2012. This apparent slowdown in surface warming has prompted a flurry of research papers as scientists seek to identify its cause. The overall conclusion from published research suggests there is no single reason for the slowdown, but rather a series of contributing factors. One of the principal causes is thought to be fluctuations in the Pacific Ocean. These fluctuations are usually known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO has two opposite phases: positive (also known as the “warm” phase) and negative (“cool”), which each affect global weather in different ways. The phases of the PDO also affect the strength of the trade winds that blow east-to-west across the tropical Pacific Ocean. These winds are driven by warm air rising along the equator and the rotation of the Earth. During a negative PDO phase, the trade winds strengthen, driving heat into the deep Pacific Ocean, which brings cooler water to the surface. This has a cooling effect on global surface temperatures, as has been seen during the recent slowdown. It’s worth noting here that the slowdown relates only to the temperature at the Earth’s surface. Looking at all the components of the climate system – including, for example, the deep ocean – scientists have no doubt that the planet as a whole has continued to warm up during the slowdown. Weaker winds during a positive PDO have the opposite effect, transferring heat from the oceans to the atmosphere and causing surface temperatures to rise more quickly. The chart below shows how the PDO has fluctuated since 1970; months where the PDO is positive are shown as red bars, while negative months are blue. You can see how the PDO has been predominantly negative since the late nineties, before turning positive again in 2014. The prevailing theory amongst scientists is that the extended negative phase of the PDO is just part of its natural cycle. But this might not be the case, says the new paper’s lead author Dr Doug Smith, who heads up the decadal climate prediction research and development at the Met Office Hadley Centre. He tells Carbon Brief: “Although the PDO can vary naturally, our results show that changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions could be largely responsible for the negative phase.” Changing aerosol emissions Aerosols are tiny particles and droplets floating around in our atmosphere. There are natural sources of aerosols, such as volcanic eruptions and chemicals released by tiny sea creatures, but humans also churn them out via vehicle exhausts and burning fossil fuels and wood. Aerosols tend to have a cooling effect on the Earth’s climate, by scattering incoming sunlight and by stimulating clouds to form, preventing the Sun’s energy reaching Earth’s surface. But these particles have also affected the phases of the PDO, the new study says. This impact stems from recent increases in aerosol emissions from China, and decreases in the US and Europe. In the map below, you can see how the concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere changed over the period of the slowdown. The red and orange areas show the upturn in aerosols, predominantly over China. In contrast, the blue shading show the reduction over Europe and eastern US. The changing concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere caused local cooling over China and warming over Europe, North America, and, hence, the North Atlantic, Smith says. This had the knock-on effect of strengthening the Pacific trade winds, prompting an extended negative phase of the PDO, and the slowdown in surface temperature rise. Using climate models, the researchers found they could recreate the negative PDO – and the surface warming slowdown – by simulating these changes in human aerosol emissions. Natural emissions of aerosols also had a small role in the slowdown, the paper notes, as the Earth was still feeling a residual cooling effect from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. Predictions Being able to recreate the impact of aerosol emissions on the PDO in climate models suggests that scientists could, in theory, have foreseen the warming slowdown, says Smith: “Our results suggests that the warming slowdown could have been predicted – assuming changes in aerosol emissions could have been anticipated.” The findings also suggest that changing emissions of human-caused aerosols will continue to have an impact on surface warming over the coming years, says Smith: “Future reductions in aerosol emissions from China – to improve air quality – could promote a positive phase of the PDO and a period of increased trends in global surface temperatures. There are some signs that this could be happening.” Bridging the gap The paper is a real advance in scientists’ understanding of how the climate varies from one decade to the next, says Prof Piers Forster, a professor of physical climate change at the University of Leeds, who wasn’t involved in the study. He tells Carbon Brief: “Researchers have typically split climate response into two parts – the ‘forced’ response due to greenhouse gases, aerosols or volcanic eruptions, and ‘internal variability’ – patterns of change, such as the El Niño, caused by the more or less random swilling around of the ocean and atmosphere.” “The really nice thing about the paper is that it makes the first steps in bridging the gap, examining how aerosol and volcanic forcing drive patterns of variability.” However, these are the findings of just one scientific paper, so further work will be needed to confirm the connection between aerosols and the negative PDO, says Prof Jerry Meehl, from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAR) in Colorado, who also wasn’t involved in the research. Large changes in aerosol emissions have happened in the past without affecting Pacific Ocean fluctuations, notes Meehl. So it may be that aerosol emissions strengthened a naturally-occurring negative phase of the PDO, rather than causing it, he says. In addition, recent research by Meehl suggests that different phases of the PDO could be triggered by El Niño events – such as the switch to a positive PDO that coincided with the recent strong El Niño event. Meehl’s study also suggests that global surface warming may accelerate over the next few years. Human-caused aerosols are, therefore, at least another factor to add to the list of those that have contributed to the global surface warming slowdown, Meehl tells Carbon Brief: “My takeaway from this paper is we may add another possible factor to the list of processes that have been identified as contributing to the early-2000s slowdown, and all likely played a role: internal [Pacific Ocean] variability, a succession of moderate-sized volcanic eruptions, an extended solar minimum around 2012, stratospheric water vapor, and now anthropogenic aerosols.”
I, though, come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. As I explain in the post that follows, Senator Paul’s focus on the substantive validity and wisdom of the phone records program has obscured two larger problems with the USA FREEDOM Act: (1) that it says nothing at all about the government’s other controversial surveillance authorities, especially those carried out pursuant to Executive Order 12,333 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008; and (2) that its procedural reforms, especially with respect to judicial review by the FISA Court, are laughably modest. These shortcomings could easily be dismissed if it was clear that Congress means to address them in subsequent legislation. But by all accounts, section 215 is–and has been–the ballgame. Thus, Senator Paul’s grandstanding on the call records program may well come to epitomize what I’ve elsewhere described as “libertarian hijacking,” “wherein libertarians form a short-term coalition with progressive Democrats on national security issues, only to pack up and basically go home once they have extracted concessions that don’t actually resolve the real issues.” Even worse, as I’ve explained, “such efforts . . . consume most (if not all) of the available oxygen and political capital, obfuscating, if not downright suppressing, the far more problematic elements of the relevant national security policy.” So too, here.
In this respect, a mature society might be compared to a long-term contractual agreement. n10 The parties to such contracts often do not rely solely, or even substantially, on the text of the contract to govern their day-to-day relationship; they have developed extratextual understandings. Similarly, in a mature society, people accept the acts of legislatures, courts, and executive agencies - and the political and nonpolitical acts of their fellow citizens - even when those acts augment or arguably conflict with the foundational text. In a newly formed political society, any apparent deviation from the words of a constitution might be seen as revolutionary and might cause the society to break apart; in a mature society, relationships and patterns of trust are so well developed that that does not happen. As a result, by the time an Article V supermajority is galvanized into action, chances are good that much of society has already changed by one of these other means. And if a formal amendment process were unavailable, society would find another way to enforce the change it has determined to make - by legislation and judicial interpretation, or by alterations in social understandings and private sector behavior. The change might not be accomplished as neatly or as decisively; outliers might not be brought into line as quickly, for example. But relatively speaking, that is a detail. Those other institutions - not supermajoritarian constitutional amendments - will be the truly important means of constitutional change. This explains why, when [*1463] society has changed enough to produce a supermajority in favor of a formal amendment, the amendment is probably unnecessary. One cannot, however, just say simplistically that any set of political forces strong enough to bring about a constitutional amendment is strong enough to change society in some other way, because that is not always true. A supermajority might act, and adopt an amendment, even if society has not fundamentally changed. An amendment might represent a momentary high-water mark of popular sentiment on a question, or an effective effort by an interest group at the height of its power to secure its position. n11 At a later time, many people, even a majority, might decide that the amendment was a mistake - but there it is, entrenched in the Constitution. On these occasions the formal amendment will be relatively insignificant for a different reason. When there is no lasting social consensus behind a textual amendment, the change in the text of the Constitution is unlikely to make a lasting difference - at least if it seeks to affect society in an important way - unless society changes in the way that the amendment envisions. Until that happens, the amendment is likely to be evaded, or interpreted in a way that blunts its effectiveness. This is, in a sense, the other side of the fact that a mature society has a variety of institutions, in addition to the text of the Constitution, that can affect how the society operates. Those institutions can change society without changing the Constitution; but they can also keep society basically the same - perhaps with some struggle, but still basically the same - even if the text of the Constitution changes. This was, most notoriously, the story of the Fourteenth and, especially, the Fifteenth Amendment. The Fifteenth Amendment was somewhat effective in the short run, but within a generation it had been reduced to a nullity in the South. n12
Caillois states that one of the prerequisites for something to be defined as a game or the act of playing is that the player voluntary participates in it. Play is necessarily an act and expression of the player’s free will and he must not be forced into the act of playing. If that happens, it is no longer play but becomes something else.¶ It is also no doubt that play must be defined as a free and voluntary activity. A game which one would be forced to play, would at once cease being play. It would become constraint, drudgery from which one would strive to be freed. As an obligation or simply an order, it would lose one of its basic characteristics: the fact that player devotes himself spontaneously to the game, of his free will and for its pleasure, each time completely free to choose retreat, silence, meditation, idle solitude or creative activity. [ ...] One plays only if and when one wishes to. (Caillois, [1958] 2001, pp. 6–7)¶ We argue that this rests on Marxist dialectics and should be seen as play versus work. For Jesper Juul (2005, pp. 31–33), on the other hand, Caillois’ idea of voluntary play/ game does not make sense. When he addresses that games according to Caillois shall be voluntary to participate in, he states that:¶ Roger Caillois claims that games are voluntary. The problem is that it is quite unclear what this means. Is it not a game if social pressure forces the player to play? Because human motivation is too complex to be simply explained in terms of its being voluntary/involuntary, I believe that it is not possible to meaningfully describe whether games are voluntary or not. However, it could be said that games are primarily autotelic; that is, they are mostly used for their own sake rather than for an external purpose. (Juul, 2005, pp. 31–32)¶ From a dialectical perspective, the idea that games are voluntary is very clear. According to Marx, capitalism is based on the illusion that a worker voluntary enters an employment in an enterprise owned by a capitalist to earn her living. The illusory part of this is the fact that the worker really has no choice but to do this. Either she works or she starves. In an oft-cited quote by Marx, he says, ‘‘in the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production’’ ([1859] 2011, p. 107). Furthermore,¶ the division of labour offers us the first example of how, as long as man remains in natural society, that is, as long as a cleavage exists between the particular and the common interest, as long, therefore as activity is not voluntarily, but naturally, divided, man’s own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him. (Marx & Engels, [1972] 2004, p. 53)¶ To work is therefore not a voluntary act but a forced necessity imposed by the capitalist structure as such, since the capitalist own the production facilities, the raw materials, and the distribution channels. Division of labor forces workers into specializing their skill so that ‘‘each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity,’’ but a sphere that is forced upon rather than controlled by him (Marx & Engels, [1972] 2004, p. 53). When Caillois says that participating in a game is voluntary, we interpret this as the relation between player and game is similar to that between a capitalist forcing a worker to work. The illusion of voluntariness from the perspective of the worker is crucial for how we should interpret Caillois’ meaning of voluntary. Our interpretation of the aspect of voluntary found in Caillois’ taxonomy of games is based on this Marxist context. He explicitly criticized Wundt’s statement that play is the child at work saying that such views are ‘‘decidedly and emphatically in error’’ (Caillois, [1958] 2001, p. 163), because they neatly conflate the two concepts. One major reason for Caillois’ attempts to keep ‘‘forced’’ gaming at bay is the productivity of play/game.¶ In Caillois’ writings, the unproductiveness of games also needs to be understood from the perspective of Marxist dialectics. On the one hand, it is obvious to us that unproductiveness of games, as Caillois explains it, is the opposite of the forced labor of the working class producing goods for the capitalist. It is also quite clear that games of chance are particularly unproductive from this perspective. Games may serve as a redistribution of resources, but, as Caillois points out, they do not in themselves produce anything material in contrast to work.¶ This dividing line between play and work is essential to understand games from a Marxist point of view. The idea of forced labor is put in contrast to the free and separate activity of play. Caillois goes as far as to quote Friedrich von Schiller when he discusses psychological approaches to understand the role of play/game in society: ‘‘For, to speak out once and for all, man only plays when in the full meaning of the word he is a man, and he is only completely a man when he plays’’ (Schiller, in Caillois, [1958] 2001, p. 163). What Schiller observed was that in industrialized societies, enjoyment becomes separated from labor, and it is upon this that Marx based his analysis of capitalist production. Caillois, thus, inherits a German tradition of critical social thought where human creativity is outside industrial production. The Frankfurt School, and in particular Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, argued that the cultural industry substituted industrial leisure time with repetitious ‘‘amusement’’ controlling its consumer by promising meaningful entertainment (Horkheimer and Adorno, [1944] 2002, p. 108).¶ In its extreme, Caillois’ voluntary definition would mean that all except play is depriving man from being man and the free will to play lies at the essence of man as a social being, making man completely a man. Work will alienate man from himself, and since the worker does not work out of free will for the employing capitalist, play is the sole remaining escape from the suppressing bourgeoisie. At the same time as Caillois embraces Marx’s dielectics on labor, he is dubious of the Soviet Union and Stalinism despite suppressing games of chance and making them illegal:¶ The Communist ideal for governing society carries this principle [gambling] to an extreme. It may be debated whether it is proper, in dividing the revenues of the state, to pay each according to his merit or according to his need, but it is certain that payment would not be according to birth or chance. [ ... ] The whole problem is to know therefore whether the complete elimination of the grand chance, unexpected, irregular, and fantastic is economically productive, or whether the state, in suppressing this instinct is not depriving itself of a generous and irreplaceable source of revenue, which may be turned into energy. (Caillois, [1958] 2001, pp. 158–159)¶ While a strong influence of surrealism is apparent in the way chance is described as bringing about ‘‘new energy’’ and ‘‘the unknown,’’ as we have elaborated on above, Caillois is also aware of the economic interest that play can have:¶ In certain of its manifestations, play is designed to be extremely lucrative or ruinous. This does not preclude the fact playing for money remains completely unproductive. The sum of the winnings at best would only equal the losses of the other players. Nearly always the winnings are less, because of large overhead, taxes, and the profit of the entrepreneur. He alone does not play, or if he plays, he is protected by the law of averages. In effect, he is the only one who cannot take pleasure in gambling. Property is exchanged, but no goods are produced. (Caillois, [1958] 2001, p. 5)¶ This assertion is, in our view, based on a Marxist analysis of capitalist production, since money gambling is a mere form of redistribution of wealth. Play/game produces no wealth or goods, ‘‘thus differing from work and art’’ (Caillois, [1958] 2001, p. 5).¶ The reading of Caillois within this Marxist context makes it fully understandable that the activity of play is for the player’s own pleasure. It is the player alone that out of her own free will enters the separate space and time of play. Separate from everyday work, separate from the production tools owned not by the worker but by the employer, the capitalist. It is not on the direct order of the employer, the capitalist, that the player plays the game. The act of playing is in essence a means for the worker to cease being a worker, for a limited time, and to become, in a surrealist sense, ‘‘something else’’ than a slave in the bounds of the capitalist. The player still needs to adhere and acquiesce to the rules of play that lie within the act of playing, but the worker who becomes a player can freely choose which game to play and hence is free to choose the rules to which she needs to succumb. Playing games is therefore to be understood as a voluntary activity in which the worker who becomes a player can throw off the bounds of capitalism and be her own master by mastering the game she engages with. Playing games voluntarily could be viewed as the antidote needed in order for the worker to develop freely her physical and mental energy and not to mortify her body and the ruination of her mind.
WHILE the United States forges ahead with its shale-led energy revolution, Russia is steadily building up its stake in the oil industry of Venezuela, where anti-American rhetoric has been the hallmark of now-ailing leader Hugo Chavezs 14-year rule.¶ Igor Sechin, president of Russia’s state-owned oil giant Rosneft, declared last month the oil-rich South American country would be the main focus of Rosneft’s overseas investments.¶ Under a series of accords signed during Sechin’s visit to Venezuela on January 29-30, Russia will commit to invest up to $US40 billion in jointly exploiting the Orinoco extra-heavy oil belt -- regarded as one of the world’s largest hydrocarbon reserves -- with Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA).¶ The US Geological Survey estimated in 2010 that the Orinoco belt, a 600-km strip straddling the Orinoco River in the central-eastern part of Venezuela, held 513 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. According to OPEC statistics, Venezuela’s proven reserves stand at 296 billion barrels, the largest in the world.¶ It also has 5.5 trillion cubic metres of gas reserves, ranking it No. 8 in gas behind Russia, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, UAE and the US.¶ Venezuela relies heavily on its oil exports, which supply 95 per cent of its foreign earnings. Output, which was above 3 million barrels a day in the 1990s and early 2000s, has since fallen below that figure, although Venezuela’s stated goal is to reach 5 million barrels a day by 2015 and 6.5 million by 2020, through development of the Orinoco belt. Venezuela’s heavy sour crude remains in demand with some refiners because it is cheaper than light sweet crude.
The beginning of the 21st century marked a shift towards a shaping and attempts at cultivating an aesthetic and critical apparatus to respond to an emerging artistic movement within literature, music, and visual art called Afrofuturism. Afrofuturism opens possibilities of developing responses to ideas about where and how people of African descent could position themselves as intricate parts of human collectives and unknown futures, especially as we move towards realizing virtual and digitalized forms of cultural expression. Further, subjectivity and taking personal agency to create imagined worlds where Black people are leaders is a strong challenge to the weakened but still existing stereotypes of Black women and men as non-intellectual or limited in technological knowledge. Development of Afrofuturism as an aesthetic, theory, or as a process is fraught with the many of same critical debates and discursive tensions that continue to permeate through Black Feminism with regard to essentialism, identity politics, performativity, and aesthetic concerns. Parallel commentary regarding bodies, gender, and race have continued to impact critical responses to speculative and science fiction coming from Afro-Diasporic writers in the 20th and 21st century. “Ironically, African-American critical theory provides very sophisticated tools for the analysis of cyberculture, since African-American critics have been discussing the problem of multiple identities, fragmented personae, and liminality for more than 100 years” Tal (1996). Making connections between two flourishing movements is not so much the issue as it is negotiating the discursive tensions with regard to political and aesthetic concerns. In order to understand these discursive tensions permeating critical reception of gender and race in Afrofuturist culture, this essay will discuss the role of critical debates and critical tensions in Black Feminist theory, as well as its role in the development of Afrofuturism as critical theory. Stereotypes regarding Black women and intellectual abilities continue to be extremely difficult to unravel in the 21st century by Black feminists who seek to build a counter-text to them. However, as noted earlier, some Black feminist theorists have attempted to take on this difficult task in order to recover Black womanhood from degradation. “Women develop theories, characters, art, and beauty free of the pressures of meeting male approval, societal standards, color-based taxonomies, or run-of-the-mill female expectations. The results are works that some critics call uncategorizable” Womack (2013). Black feminists have persisted in creating fissures in these “bodies” of “knowledge” in order to question and unravel these stereotypes, while opening possibilities for critical inquiry that would traverse new terrain in Africana women’s speculative/science fiction. Black Feminist Theory Early Approaches Over the course of well over forty years, Black women intellectuals have engaged in theoretical debate and discussion as a means towards building a critical apparatus that would address both aesthetic and political concerns regarding the “place” and “position” of Black women writers, artists, in addition to our presence as academics in higher education. Barbara Smith’s “call to action” for a Black feminist theory during the 1970s, argued for a breaking of racial and gendered silence in understanding Black women writers’ work: “Black women’s existence, experience, and culture and the brutally complex systems of oppression which shape these in the in `real world’ of white and/or male consciousness beneath consideration, invisible, unknown” Smith (1978). For Smith, Black women struggled to be heard and acknowledged as contributors to literary traditions, and as “outsiders,” were subject to marginalization in academic discourse. During the 70s, 80s and 90s, Black Feminism as a form of literary inquiry, or what became known as “Black Feminist Theory,” came into the academic community through the work of Barbara Smith, the Combahee River Collective, Mary Helen Washington, Toni Cade Bambara, Audre Lorde, Michelle Wallace, Beverly Guy-Sheftall, Angela Davis, bell hooks, Alice Walker, Evelynn Hammond, Barbara Christian, Deborah McDowell, Mae Gwendolyn Henderson, Valerie Smith, Patricia Hill Collins, June Jordan, and Hortense Spillers. Approaches to Black feminist theory during the 1980s were fraught with debates regarding politics of language, which in turn unfolded tensions between what some Black feminists saw as essentialism and what other Black feminists saw as articulation of what had been deemed by the hegemony as unspeakable and unacceptable in an overwhelming White, male, heteronormative academy: the Black female body. Barbara Christian warned of the dangers of becoming entangled in “academic language” that that could not only alienate and exclude, but miss engaging in crucial inquiries: “Academic language has become the new metaphysic through which we turn leaden idiom into golden discourse. But by writing more important thinking exclusively in this language, we not only speak but to ourselves, we also are in danger of not asking those critical questions which our native tongues insist we ask” Christian (1989). Christian’s concerns were in part a response to Hazel Carby, who debated and disagreed with Christian and McDowell’s critique regarding the direction of Black feminism towards a discursive body infused with dense, Eurocentric language designed to exclude: “For I feel that the new emphasis on literary critical theory is as hegemonic as the world which it attacks” (Christian, 1987). Hazel Carby, paraphrasing Elaine Showalter in her introduction to Reconstructing Womanhood, suggested a model of black feminist theory, which would occur in three phases: “(1) the concentration on the misogyny (and racism) of literary practice; (2) the discovery that (black) women writers had a literature of their own (previously hidden by patriarchal [and racist] values) and the development of a (black) female aesthetic; and (3) a challenge to and rethinking of the conceptual grounds of literary study and an increased concern with theory” Carby (1987). Carby rejected the notion of shared experience between black women critics and black women writers as ahistorical and essentialist. She did “not assume the existence of a tradition or traditions of black women writings and, indeed, is critical of traditions of Afro-American intellectual thought that have been constructed as paradigmatic of Afro-American history” (Carby, 1987). Carby saw “black feminist” and ‘black woman” as being signs; black feminist theory, in her view, must interrogate the sign as “an arena of struggle and a construct between socially organized persons in the process of their interaction [and] as conditioned by the social organization of the participants involved and also by the immediate conditions of their interactions” (Carby, 1987). Language in black women’s literature, in Carby’s view, was not some universal code of communication or an essentialist vision of communion between black women (Carby, 1987). Carby intersected critical and political aspects of reading which serve to modify poststructuralist models of criticism with the intention of moving black feminist criticism directly in the midst of “the race for theory.” Deborah McDowell noted the importance of the work completed and progress made by critics coming out of Black Arts Movement and the Black Feminist Movement to bring Black female writers into the larger academic discourse McDowell (1990). “ In isolating and affirming the particulars of black female experience they inspired and authorized writers from those cultures to sing in their different voices and to imagine an audience that could hear the song” (McDowell, 1990). Elizabeth Alexander views the 80-90s struggle for theoretical ground as counterproductive to transformation of academic inquiry and academic space: “As “race” became a “category,” and much intellectual energy was put into critiquing “essentialism,” the focus was lost on actual people of color, their voices and contributions, as well as, more practically, the importance of increasing their—out—empowered presence on campuses and in other workplaces. The extreme reaches are not unimaginable: a gender studies without women, “race” studies without black people and other people of color” (McDowell, 1990). Black Feminism and Marginality Politics Other Black feminists furthered the call for theory through series of reshaping and reimagining European theoretical apparatuses, borrowing discursive strategies introduced by Bahktin, Derrida, Freud/Lacan in order to do what Audre Lorde warned could not be done: use the Master’s Tools to dismantle the Master’s “House,” which could be considered as signified through imposition of “theoretical discourse.” For example, Wallace borrowed Houston Baker’s trope of the black hole, in which “black holes may give access to other dimensions…and object …enters the black hole and is infinitely compressed to zero volume…it passes through to another dimension, whereupon the object…reassumes…all of the properties of visibility and concreteness, but in another dimension” Wallace (1990). The dialectic of black women’s art is forced into the position of “other” by white women and black men, who are themselves other to white men (Wallace, 1990). The trope of the black hole described the dimensions of negation, and described the repressed accumulation of black feminist creativity as compressed mass, negated from existence in the race and production of theory (Wallace, 1990). “The outsider sees black feminist creativity as a hole from which nothing worthwhile can emerge and in which everything is forced to assume the zero volume of nothingness, the invisibility, that results from the intense pressure of race, class and sex” (Wallace, 1990). Here, Wallace attempted to address what Mary O’Connor considered to be “nothingness….as a place of origin for …much of black feminist writing…imposed from without, entity defined by the patriarchal and white world of power and wealth.” Mary Helen Washington declared that black women “have been hidden artists–creative geniuses…whose creative impulses have been denied and thwarted in a society in which they have been valued only as a source of cheap labor” Washington (1974). Through the margin of resistance black women writers encourage others to write, to create works of art, and to break through the “black hole”. During the early 1990s bell hooks theorized that art created in the margin as radical, saying that “[i]n this space of collective despair resistance to colonization becomes a vital component to the creativity at risk. Space is interrupted, appropriated and transformed through artistic and literary intervention” hooks (1990). Black women’s creative works reached back into the broken and silenced past and re-cover and re-claim the repressed words of their ancestors, while speaking of their experiences and beauty. bell hooks saw aesthetics as a means of inhabiting space or location, a way of looking and becoming (hooks, 1990). “African American discourse on aesthetics is not prescriptive…the location of white western culture is only one location of discourse on aesthetics.” (hooks, 1990). Aesthetics were also formed through encouragement of other black women to write and to express themselves artistically. “The realities of choice and location are confronted in the gesture of “re-vision,” shaping and determining the response to existing cultural practices and in the capacity to envision new alternative, oppositional aesthetic acts” (hooks, 1990). hooks also saw subjectivity in black women as a process towards political radicalness, and that black women writers should resist Western notions of subjectivity, which limit the ability to commit to political upheaval the structures which oppress black women (hooks, 1990). For hooks, although black women’s writing contained radical resistance to racist oppression, many black female writers limited black women characters’ progress after breaking away from oppression instead of becoming radical subjects of resistance (hooks, 1990). Contemporary black women writers linked subjectivity with emotional and spiritual health, ignoring the possibility of commitment to radical politics and the possibility of resisting unity concepts and accepting difference in female experience and in subjectivity itself, reinforcing dominant feminist thought and essentialist notions of black identity (hooks, 1990). Further, hooks viewed marginality as being more than a site of deprivation; for her the margin was a position of political possibility and a space of resistance, and a location of counter-hegemonic discourse which also came from lived experience (hooks, 1990). Black women writers have possibilities of multiple locations of expression. When black women as “other” speaks and writes in resistance, she is no longer a silent object of derision or object of degradation; she is a radical subject of resistance. As a speaking “other” she is not the muted other, but a subject of power, power which is used to deconstruct the structures of oppression. However, like Barbara Christian, hooks warned black feminists regarding slippage between the voice of the oppressed and the voice of oppressor, especially with regard to power relations and domination of the oppressed. (hooks, 1990). Language was “a politicization of memory” which explained the present while articulating the past (hooks, 1990). Mae Gwendolyn Henderson referred to this articulation as a sort of “speaking in tongues, ” an ability of black women through their location as marginalized to see and speak more than one language as reader Henderson (1989). Henderson proposed a discursive strategy that “seeks to account for racial difference within gender identity and gender difference within racial identity. This approach represents [her] effort to avoid ….the presumed `absolute and self-sufficient’ otherness of the critical stance in order to allow the complex representations of black women writers to steer use away from `a simple and reductive paradigm of otherness.’” (Henderson, 1989). To Henderson, critical theory in the dominant hegemony negated the multiplicity of voices of subjectivity within black women’s writing, which was in “dialogue with the plural aspects of self that constitute the matrix of black female subjectivity”, and was in “dialogue with the aspects of “otherness” within the self” (Henderson, 1989). Henderson’s critical model proposed the existence of heteroglossia in black women’s writing, borrowing from Mikhail Bakhtin’s “notion of dialogism”, in which “voices of the other(s) `encounter one another and coexist in the consciousness of real people”…that speaks to the situation of black women writers in particular, `privileged’ by a social positionality that enables them to speak in dialogically racial and gendered voices to the other(s) both within and without” (Henderson, 1989). Henderson saw black female creative writers as “enter[ing] simultaneously into familial, or testimonial and public or competitive discourses….that….enter into testimonial discourse with black men as blacks, with white women as women and with black women as black women…..[and]…enter into a competitive discourse with black men as women, with white women as blacks, and with white men as black women” (Henderson, 1989). Henderson suggested the development of “an enabling critical fiction–that it is black women writers who are the modern-day apostles, empowered by experience to speak as poets and prophets in many tongues….signify[ing] a deliberate intervention by black women writers into the canonic tradition of sacred/literary texts” (Henderson, 1989). She argued that Black women were in a unique position of possibilities as prophets, as with the Hebrew prophets of old, who were in a unique position of being the mouthpiece of God. Conversely, Michelle Wallace offered the caveat that romanticizing or privileging marginality as a primary theoretical/political strategy would lead to a reaffirmation of the white hegemony through reinforcement of the image of the silent “strong matriarch” who is “already liberated” from her oppression (Wallace, 1990). These and other images could be used by the hegemony to silence the process of resistance (Wallace, 1990). “It seemed to me the evidence was everywhere in American culture that precisely because of their political and economic disadvantages, black women were considered to have a peculiar advantage” (Wallace, 1990). For hooks, a strategy of building a critical apparatus that would resist a fixed position or singularity of identity that could be co-opted; rather, it would open possibilities of opening inquiry on multiple experiences and voices. “A radical aesthetic acknowledges that because of changing positions and locations, there can never be one critical paradigm for evaluating African American art” (hooks, 1990). Still, other critics like Deborah Chay, whose essay “Rereading Barbara Christian: Black Feminist Criticism and the Category of Experience” constructed a strong theoretical rebuttal of the notion of “experience” or “representation” as theorized by Barbara Smith, Barbara Christian, and other early Black feminists, offered a blunt observation that the dilemma faced by Black feminist critics was one that was brought on their dependency on a paradigm that was itself self-evident of a need for them to transcend its limits and traps: “I would like to suggest that it is precisely to the extent that the grounds for their differentiation cannot be maintained that black feminists may make their strongest case for both the continuity and the importance of their critical project. That is, the conditions which continue to make an appeal to experience as a logical, appealing, and invisible foundation themselves constitute the most powerful argument for the continued need for “black feminist critics” to organize and inventively challenge the apparatus and terms of their representation Chay (1993).” In other words, the strategy of relying on “experience” or “representation” as a theoretical foundation exposed a theoretical flaw that would and did, in time, prove to become intellectual traps for Black feminists. In addition to critiques on the limits of identity-based theory that focused on race and gender, significant contributions were published by Black feminists who felt the need to address what Hortense J. Spillers and Evelynn Hammonds referred to as “silences” in mainstream feminism with regard to Black female bodies and sexualities. For instance, Spillers argued that mainstream feminism’s silence towards Black female tended to perpetuate dominant ideological paradigms that continued to perpetuate oppressive impressions of Black female sexuality. “I wish to suggest that the lexical gaps I am describing here are manifest along a range of symbolic behavior in reference to black women and that the absence of sexuality as a structure of distinguishing terms is solidly grounded in the negative aspects of symbol-making. The latter, in turn are wed to the abuses and uses of history, and how it is perceived.” Spillers (2003). Spillers asserted a need for Black feminists to pursue a discursive strategy to correct “official” histories of Black female sexuality that would reposition us as a disruptive force to counter hegemonic influence: The aim, though obvious, might be restated: to restore to women’s historical movement its complexity of issues and supply the right verb to the subject searching for it,  feminists are called upon to initiate a corrected and revised view of women of color on the frontiers of symbolic action” (Spillers, 2003). In addition to Spillers’ call to Black feminists, Hammonds also proposed a much more decisive and unequivocal discursive strategy for Black feminists. She saw Black feminists’ reluctance to pursue a theoretical direction that included discussions on lesbian eros as an exclusionary tactic that exposed a privileging of heterosexual desire, as well as the presence of the excluded lesbian text: “Since silence about sexuality is being produced by black women and black feminist theorists, that silence itself suggests that black women do have some degree of agency. A focus on black lesbian sexualities, I suggest, implies that another discourse—other than silence—can be produced Hammonds (1994).” Hammonds believed such discourse to be crucial to the development of Black feminist criticism that would contend with Black women artists and writers articulating from a previously missed context that needed to be explored in order to address sexual difference and multiplicity. For Hammonds, breaking this silence was a decisive move that could not be ignored by Black feminists. “Disavowing the designation of black female sexualities as inherently abnormal, while acknowledging the material and symbolic effects of the appellation, we could begin the project of understanding how differently located black women engage in reclaiming the body and expressing desire (Hammonds, 1994). Black Feminism and Intersectionality In the 21st century Black feminism has continued to engage in a series of complex struggles to engage a rapidly changing academic and theoretical landscape challenged by instabilities and uncertainties with regard to political and cultural alliances. For some Black women, disengaging themselves from the limits of a feminism aligned with a singularity of racial identity while remaining committed to dismantling oppressive ideological frameworks entailed developing and encouraging a critical strategy that promised a much more complex engagement: intersectionality. Jennifer C. Nash defined intersectionality as “the notion that subjectivity is constituted by mutually reinforcing vectors of race, gender, class, and sexuality, has emerged as the primary theoretical tool designed to combat feminist hierarchy, hegemony, and exclusivity” Nash (2011). Nash’s essay “rethinking intersectionality” criticized intersectionality’s tendency to persist in Black feminism’s theoretical problem of “continuously and strategically jamming the workings of binary thinking” by “continu[ing] in the tradition of black feminism with the addition of a new name for conceptualizing the workings of identity” (Nash, 2011). For Nash, intersectionality as a truly useful and progressive theoretical apparatus needed to undergo a critical overhaul that would correct its ambiguity as to how it distinguishes itself from previous versions of Black feminism, whether it remained a part of Black feminist theory as a revised or emergent version, or whether it served as a critical strategy that completely “departs” from it (Nash, 2011). Nash asserted that “[i]n conceiving of privilege and oppression as complex, multi-valent, and simultaneous, intersectionality could offer a more robust conception of both identity and oppression” (Nash, 2011). She suggested an intersectionality strategy that would study “race and gender as co-constitutive processes and as distinctive and historically specific technologies of categorization,” which would in turn allow a much more robust intellectual engagement that would result in “insights that far exceed imagining race and gender as inextricably bound up” (Nash, 2011). By 2011, Nash takes her call to reconsider intersectional analysis in a critical and political direction that seems to anticipate and invite what I would refer to as a theoretical “bridge” for those who would seek to engage in Black feminism beyond identity traps, especially for those who seek to connect Black feminism with Afrofuturism. Her essay “Practicing Love: ‘Black Feminism, Love-Politics, and Post-Intersectionality’” takes on Audre Lorde’s theory of the erotic in her (1983) essay “Uses of the Erotic” and remixes it with affective theory, proposing a Black feminist love politics that would expose “the existence—indeed, vibrancy—of multiple black feminist political traditions” through “a radical conception of the public sphere” and through “a new relationship to temporality generally, and to futurity” (Nash, 2011). Nash asserts what I would consider a theoretical bridge that invites an Afrofuturist vision of Black feminism when she theorizes that “love-politics practitioners dream of a yet unwritten future; they imagine a world ordered by love, by a radical embrace of difference, by a set of subjects who work on/against themselves to work for each other” (Nash, 2011). Bridge Towards Afrofuturism The rise of Afrofuturism in the 21st century, a name first articulated by Greg Tate in the mid 1990s, can be considered as an aesthetic and critical process existing at the side of and through the development of Black feminism and its critical companion intersectionality. It is inclusive of science fiction, fantasy, and speculative fiction, as well as visual art, music, and technological infusion into Afro-Diasporic cultures. Jewelle Gomez refers to “speculative fiction,” as new landscapes and life experience are imagined beyond the limits of the so-called real: “[s]peculative fiction is a way of expanding our ideas of what human nature really is, allowing us to consider all aspects of ourselves; it is important that a diverse range of writers, Black lesbian writers included, participate in this expansion” Gomez (1991). D. Denenge Akpem, discussing the 2011 Afrofuturism Conference in Chicago Art Magazine, describes Afrofuturism as “an exploration and methodology of liberation, simultaneously both a location and a journey…[w]e are alchemists in this city of steel, akin to the Yoruba god Ogun, fusing metal to metal.” As “alchemists,” Afrofuturists invoke the past as a means towards imagining a future that is not only inclusive of us as participants but as shapers of worlds that embrace new permutations of existence, as well as new permutations of expression, artistically. “Afrofuturism as a movement itself may be the first in which black women creators are credited for the power of their imaginations and are equally represented as the face of the future and the shapers of the future” (Womack, 2012). Like Black Feminists, Afrofuturists engage in a recovery and retelling of the presence of people of African descent as contributors to cultural production and articulation. “Afrofuturism has evolved into a coherent mode not only aesthetically but also in terms of its political mission. In its broadest dimensions Afrofuturism is an extension of the historical recovery projects that black Atlantic intellectuals have engaged in for well over two hundred years” (Sdonline). Rather than following dominant cultural assumptions of Africana culture as being in opposition to a digitalized future or present, Akpem invokes an Orisha who symbolizes humanity’s changing relationship with those elements that provide us with the tools for innovation, invention, and advancement. Ogun, the God of iron, shapes not just spears and guns, but railroads, locomotives, cars, and ships. His “children” are not just warriors, but also inventors and drivers. Afrofuturism is also a reclaiming of space previously assumed to be alien to us; it is not so much about being included in someone else’s cultural and technological conversation, as it is a reclaiming of authority to speak as creators and inventors. For Black feminists, such a process surpasses socio-cultural codes demanding containment. “While Afrofuturist women are obviously shaped by modern gender issues, their creations and theories themselves emerge from a space that renders such limitations moot” (Womack, 2012). This process intervenes and interrupts what Alondra Nelson refers to as “the racialized digital divide narrative” in a collection of essays on Afrofuturism called “Future Texts,” a special edition of Social Text (2002): The racialized digital divide narrative that circulates in the public sphere and the bodiless, color-blind mythotopias of cybertheory and commercial advertising have become the unacknowledged frames of reference for understanding race in the digital age. In these frameworks, the technologically enabled future is by its very nature unmoored from the past and from people of color. Neocritical narratives suggest that it is primitiveness or outmodedness, the obsolescence of something or someone else, that confirms the novel status of the virtual self, the cutting-edge product, or the high-tech society Nelson (2002). Racialized tropes that dominate the “public sphere” have been flooded with the notion that a digitalized or highly technological space cannot exist or flourish in a future populated with people of color because they/we are outdated, or of a past existence. Cultural expressions coming from such ideological paradigms assume a future free of those populations that signify a racialized limitation, as well as a past with a very limited or dim view of racial others. Nelson sees writers like Ishmael Reed as an example of a futurist vision that counters the hegemony’s script: “Like [Ishmael Reed’s] critique of the dominant mythos of “Western civ,” his anachronistic use of technology in Mumbo Jumbo begs the question of what tools are valued by whom, and to what ends. With his innovative novel as an exemplar, Ishmael Reed has supplied a paradigm for an African diasporic technoculture (Nelson, 2002).” Reed’s depiction of “technology” serves as a subversion of the dominant tropes by revising and reimagining stories of both our past and our future from a vantage point of one who is able to see our presence as both inventors and users of technology. As Nalo Hopkinson notes with a certain joy, speculation in fiction offers Afrofuturist writers a means towards “shaking up” the hegemony: “Science fiction and fantasy are already about subverting paradigms. It’s something I love about them” Hopkinson (2010). Teresa Goddu asserts that African American writers who have ventured into speculative fiction featuring horror or the fantastic engage in a counter-text or counter-theoretical mode of writing about the past, where the “horror” of the slave institution, Jim Crow, and the aftermath provide rich, fertile ground upon which to imagine supernatural or preternatural figures who exist in a world already rife with evils of racism, subjugation, and dehumanization. She asserts that “[f]rom Morrison’s vampiric Beloved, who sucks the past out of Sethe, to Eddie Murphy’s Vampire in Brooklyn (1995), which replays Dracula’s landing in England as the entrance into New York harbor of a crumbling Caribbean slave ship populated with corpses, the African-American vampire reminds us that the American gothic travels from elsewhere and is burdened by the horror of racial history” Goddu (1999). Kodwo Eshun’s theorization moves in a direction similar to that of Nelson’s trajectory, in that he also sees Afrofuturism as interrupting the old version of the story of the future Eshun (2003). Further, Eshun views Afrofuturism as an emergence of “temporal complications and episodes that disturb the linear time of progress” which “adjust the temporal logics that condemned the black subjects to prehistory” (Eshun, 2003). Put another way,  Afrofuturism is a process or performative that disrupts and erupts commonly understood sequential order of things, or what we have understood to be history, or even fact. For novelist Nalo Hopkinson,  the speculative possesses a political vehicle that allows writers to explore racial and social class performativity: “So one might say that, at a very deep level, one of the things that fantasy and science fiction do is to use myth-making to examine and explore socioeconomically configured ethnoracial power imbalances” (Hopkinson, 2010). According to Herman Gray, Afrofuturist writers like Octavia Butler, Samuel Delaney, and others inspire this movement in such a way that encourages an imagined existence in the African Diaspora beyond colonized borders and the legacy and terror of slavery and its aftermath. Gray asserts that “Afrofuturists claim that blacks scattered across the Atlantic world are aliens in an alien land, ever on the lookout for clues and resources that point the way out of alien nations and conditions of bondage” (Gray, 2005). Linking Afrofuturist fiction to Afrofuturist music as similar movements away from these limits, Gray contends this movement as a significant step towards liberation, where the liminal could produce innovative modes of fashioning the African diasporic self: “It is possible to rebuild old and make anew different diasporic connections, as well as to imagine possibilities for inhabiting the spaces and identities about which Sun Ra wrote” Gray (2005). Afrofuturism positions the master narrative about the past, present, and future into one of instability and uncertainty, which is, without a doubt, a critical and political strategy that can align and inform with that of a Black feminist process that seeks to develop a discursive strategy that complicates and disrupts those narratives and myths that depend on a singularity of timelines or more importantly, identity politics. Afrofuturism and Black feminism are both vital critical apparatus vehicles for Afro-Diasporic women and men who seek to enter and disrupt an otherwise homogenous ideological framework.
Gun control advocates are hyperventilating over President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Michael Bloomberg’s anti-gun rights group, Everytown for Gun Safety, warned: “Judge Kavanaugh has applied an extreme and dangerous interpretation of the Second Amendment when determining whether a law is constitutional, one that does not take into account a law’s impact on public safety.” Since the Supreme Court’s last gun control case in 2010, the court has turned away at least 15 gun-rights cases, including several challenges to prohibitions on semi-automatic assault rifles and on public carry of firearms. Gun control advocates hoped that the Supreme Court would overturn unfavorable lower court decisions. Some believe that Justice Anthony Kennedy stopped the court from taking these cases, but it could just as easily have been Chief Justice John Roberts, who places considerable weight on building consensus and is willing to put off dealing with contentious issues. Rarely is any information released on who voted to hear these appeals. Gun control advocates are most upset by a 2011 dissent in which Kavanaugh voted to strike down Washington, D.C.’s ban on most semi-automatic rifles. Two other judges voted to uphold the ban, so Kavanaugh lost the vote. But it's easy to read too much into any one case, especially when a judge is simply following precedent set by the Supreme Court — in this case, precedent from the 2008 Heller decision that struck down D.C.’s handgun ban. "As a lower court, however, it is not our role to re-litigate Heller or to bend it in any particular direction,” Kavanaugh wrote. "Our sole job is to faithfully apply Heller and the approach it set forth for analyzing gun bans and regulations.” Lower court judges are supposed to follow Supreme Court precedent, whether or not they personally agree with the decision. When a judge ignores precedent, it is easy to infer that he is acting on his own political biases. But Kavanaugh has been a consistent follower of precedent while he has been on the D.C. Circuit Court, widely acknowledged to be the nation’s second highest court, just below the Supreme Court. While the Supreme Court can overrule its own precedent, Kavanaugh has co-authored a hefty 942 page book on the topic titled “Law of Judicial Precedent.” The book seeks to describe rules governing when courts should follow precedent, and it makes clear that jettisoning precedent is not something that he takes lightly. It's not as though Kavanaugh took a particularly strong self-defense rights view of Supreme Court precedent: “Heller largely preserved the status quo of gun regulation in the United States. Heller established that traditional and common gun laws in the United States remain constitutionally permissible.” Kavanaugh showed consistent respect for precedent, but the left insists that he is dangerous because he supposedly won’t follow precedent when it comes to Roe v. Wade. But during his confirmation hearing to the D.C. Circuit Court in 2006, Kavanaugh promised, “I would follow Roe v Wade faithfully and fully.” In language very similar to what he said to justify his decision on D.C.’s rifle ban, Kavanaugh explained that Roe v Wade would be, “Binding precedent of the court. It’s been decided by the Supreme Court.” Bloomberg’s Everytown is also simply wrong when it says that Kavanaugh “does not take into account a law’s impact on public safety.” For example, on page 33 of his dissent, Kavanaugh compares the safety issues for semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles. On pages 42 and 43 he compares the relatively safety aspects of licensing versus registration laws. Maybe gun control advocates don't like that Kavanaugh actually knows something about guns. While other judges seemed to think that military-style assault weapons are somehow different from other types of semi-automatic rifles, Kavanaugh understood the word“style.” These guns may look like military weapons, but they fire one bullet per trigger-pull, just like any other semi-automatic. Kavanaugh notes of the D.C. law: "It bans certain semi-automatic rifles but not others — with no particular explanation or rationale for why some made the list and some did not. The list appears to be haphazard." Liberals don’t seem to understand that there are judges who actually follow the rules, not their personal views. In addition, Kavanaugh is hardly the wide-eyed radical gun control advocates paint him to be. He believes that “regulations on the sale, possession, or use of guns are permissible” and that the Heller decision “largely preserved the status quo of gun regulation in the United States.”
Although modern investment clauses and investor-state dispute resolution have been with us since the 1950s, resort to them was limited during their first 50 years when only fifty investor-state claims were filed.12 Investors reserved their claims for those exceptional cases where hard investments were nationalized or transferred to others without compensation by regimes either committed to state ownership or captured by crony capitalism. In contrast, since 2001, four hundred investor-state disputes have been filed. Investors have won nearly $3 billion from taxpayers in arbitral awards and another $15 billion in claims is pending under U.S. FTAs and BITs alone.13 Moreover, the average cost of arbitral proceedings is nearly $8 million, although the Philippines’ tribunal costs and legal costs in a single case exceeded $50 million.14 This sea change in investor-state claims occurred because investors belatedly realized that not only could they bring claims against banana-republic confiscations but against emerging economies and even advanced democracies whenever their unrequited expectations of profits were thwarted by government regulations, adverse adjudicative decisions, and other state practices. Accordingly, foreign corporations have used investor-state dispute resolution to challenge a broad array of environmental and land use laws, government procurement decisions, regulatory permitting, financial regulations, consumer protection, public health, and public safety laws, and a range of other public interest policies.15 Claims in extractive industries are common. For example, Churchill Mining has filed a $2 billion claim against Indonesia relating to its mining regulations.16 ICSID recently ordered Ecuador to pay Occidental Petroleum $1.77 billion in a disagreement over an oil concession contract in the largest investor-state award to date. Claims relating to environmental and public health hazards are also common. One prominent public health example is the pending arbitral claim against Australia under a 1993 Australia-Hong Kong bilateral investment treaty brought by an affiliate of Phillips Morris challenging plain packaging restrictions on tobacco products.17 Phillips Morris is pursuing its 2011 arbitral claim despite the Australian High Court having confirmed the constitutionality of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act of 2011.18 In the infamous Metalclad v. Mexico case, a U.S. toxic waste disposal firm challenged a Mexican city’s refusal to grant a construction permit for a toxic waste facility until and unless the firm cleaned up pre-existing toxic waste problems that it knew about when it purchased the property from a previous polluter. In an earlier instance, Canada reversed an environmental ban on a gasoline additive MMT, a probable carcinogen, after U.S. Ethyl Corporation filed a NAFTA investor-state claim against it.
Life in the world's oceans faces far greater change and risk of large-scale extinctions than at any previous time in human history, a team of the world's leading marine scientists has warned.The researchers from Australia, the US, Canada, Germany, Panama, Norway and the UK have compared events which drove massive extinctions of sea life in the past with what is observed to be taking place in the seas and oceans globally today.¶ Three of the five largest extinctions of the past 500 million years were associated with global warming and acidification of the oceans -- trends which also apply today, the scientists say in a new article in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution.¶ Other extinctions were driven by loss of oxygen from seawaters, pollution, habitat loss and pressure from human hunting and fishing -- or a combination of these factors."Currently, the Earth is again in a period of increased extinctions and extinction risks, this time mainly caused by human factors," the scientists stated. While the data is harder to collect at sea than on land, the evidence points strongly to similar pressures now being felt by sea life as for land animals and plants. The researchers conducted an extensive search of the historical and fossil records to establish the main causes of previous marine extinctions -- and the risk of their recurring today.¶ "We wanted to understand what had driven past extinctions of sea life and see how much of those conditions prevailed today," says co-author Professor John Pandolfi, of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and The University of Queensland, an authority on the fate of coral reefs in previous mass extinction events.¶ "It is very useful to look back in time -- because if you forget your history, you're liable to repeat it."¶ Marine extinction events vary greatly. In the 'Great Death' of the Permian 250 million years ago, for example, an estimated 95 per cent of marine species died out due to a combination of warming, acidification, loss of oxygen and habitat. Scientists have traced the tragedy in the chemistry of ocean sediments laid down at the time, and abrupt loss of many sea animals from the fossil record.¶ "We are seeing the signature of all those drivers today -- plus the added drivers of human overexploitation and pollution from chemicals, plastics and nutrients," Prof. Pandolfi says.¶ "The fossil record tells us that sea life is very resilient -- that it recovers after one of these huge setbacks. But also that it can take millions of years to do so."¶ The researchers wrote the paper out of their concern that the oceans appear to be on the brink of another major extinction event.¶ "There may be still time to act," Prof. Pandolfi says. "If we understand what drives ocean extinction, we can also understand what we need to do to prevent or minimize it.¶ "We need to understand that the oceans aren't just a big dumping ground for human waste, contaminants and CO2 -- a place we can afford to ignore or overexploit. They are closely linked to our own survival, wellbeing and prosperity as well as that of life on Earth in general.¶ "Even though we cannot easily see what is going on underwater, we need to recognise that the influence of 7 billion humans is now so great it governs the fate of life in the oceans. And we need to start taking responsibility for that."¶ He adds "The situation is not hopeless. If fact we have seen clear evidence both from the past and the present that sea life can bounce back, given a chance to do so.¶ "For example, in Australia we have clear evidence of that good management of coral reefs can lead to recovery of both corals and fish numbers.¶ "So, rather, our paper is an appeal to humanity to give the oceans a chance.¶ "In effect, it says we need to stop releasing the CO2 that drives these massive extinction events, curb the polluted and nutrient-rich runoff from the land that is causing ocean 'dead zones' manage our fisheries more sustainably and protect their habitat better.¶ "All these things are possible, but people need to understand why they are essential. That is the first step in taking effective action to prevent extinctions."
WASHINGTON, D.C. - President Obama announced a new executive order to expand protected marine waters Tuesday, making it the second executive order this week. Following Monday's announcement that the White House is making it illegal for government contractors to discriminate based on sexual preference, Obama introduced Tuesday a proposal that could create the largest sanctuary for marine life in the world and double the area of ocean that is protected globally. Under the proposal, a large expanse of the central Pacific Ocean will become a protected national monument and off limits to fishing. According to two analyses obtained by the Washington Post, The Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument would be expanded from 87,000 square miles to about 782,000 square miles. If all goes according to plan, the proposal will go into effect later this year. This most recent order, filed without the help or advice of Congress, is further proof that the President is following through on the promises he made in this year’s State of the Union Address. Obama vowed that he would step-up his use of executive authority in his remaining two years as president and that he would no longer wait for Congress to move ahead on his agenda. Tuesday's announcement is Obama’s first executive order that places protections on marine waters. It will be added to the list of 11 other executive orders he enacted since his presidency began that protect areas of land.
The best approach is to eliminate the region system from the diversity lottery entirely. As Professor Stephen Legomsky has stated, "Countries don't immigrate. People do."140 A Mexican individual without family or business ties in the United States has exactly the same immigration prospects as an Irish individual without family or business ties in the United States.141 The only way to truly level the playing field for all would-be "independent" immigrants is to abandon the region system entirely. This approach may not compensate those countries that had previously benefited from racial and ethnic discrimination under the national origins quota system; but perpetuating the effects of such a discriminatory system should not be an objective of U.S. immigration policy. Only by creating a truly equal playing field, without respect to borders, can the United States send the clear message that its immigration policy truly values individuals (and diversity) without regard to race or national origin.142 Of course, there are several ways to administer a diversity system that disregards country (or region) of origin. The Senate already presented one such approach—a points-based system that selects immigrants based on their possession of characteristics considered favorable to the national interest, such as education level. The difficulty with this approach, however, is its inherent potential to mask discrimination. For example, the Senate excised an English language quotient to alleviate concerns about discrimination, only to have the same English language criterion find its way into one of the House bills considered in subcommittee hearings."3 Furthermore, the Senate approved a provision allocating points based on a potential immigrant's age. But if age preference is acceptable national policy, might not gender or skin color also be acceptable considerations? As illustrated by the current diversity lottery, cultural discrimination may already be an accepted national policy. Put simply, there is too much potential for discrimination in any system of independent immigration that allows legislators to determine which characteristics are desirable and which are not, especially since the Supreme Court has made clear that Congress has unfettered dominion over the immigration selection process." The only acceptable approach to independent immigration is one that does not discriminate at any level. At this point, the suggestion (and foresight) of the Organization of Chinese Americans is worth reconsideration: "If after enactment, the program is determined to not enhance diversity, then a random lottery first-come, first-serve system should be immediately implemented.""5 The February 1989 American Bar Association resolution made a similar recommendation: "a separate additional quota allotment for independent or unsponsored immigrants based on a nondiscriminatory selection ( 4 system or lottery, or both . . . ."146 The best system for admitting independent immigrants and increasing true diversity (cultural, geographic, economic, and racial) is a random lottery where the only qualification is a desire to live in "The Land of the Free." A random world-wide lottery would allocate visas to the geographic areas with the greatest demand. As stated by Professor—Frederick Whelan, "formal equality of treatment for countries obviously does not mean equality of opportunity for individuals, sin —a person's chance of being issued a visa, or the length of time he must wait for one, varies greatly depending on the demand in his country.r147 Although Whelan's statement was a criticism of the uniform country ceilings, it is equally applicable to the current lottery system, whose highly formalized treatment of countries and regions clearly "does not mean equality of opportunity for individuals..14149 Furthermore, it is at least theoretically possible that a random lottery would do a better job of distributing visas to currently underserved regions than the current lottery. If Africa, Europe, and South America, for example, all have a similar number of individuals desiring to immigrate to the United States, a random lottery will ensure that, on average, each of these regions will receive an equal allotment of lottery visas. But if it turns out that more individuals want to immigrate to the United States from one particular region, a random lottery will not artificially inflate or deflate the actual demand for visas frobm each region.149 In addition, a random lottery eliminates any discrepancies in the region definitions—for example, by assigning Middle Eastern countries to three different regions.I50 Most importantly, however, a random lottery focuses on the individual. By considering each applicant without regard to race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, age, primary language, or any other artificial criterion, only a random world-wide lottery can provide a truly equitable system of independent immigration.
The attempt to provide a genuinely non-anthropocentric set of values, or preferences seems to be a hopeless quest. Once we eschew all human values, interests and preferences we are confronted with just too many altematives, as we can see when we consider biological history over a billion year time scale. The problem with the various non-anthropocentric bases for value which have been proposed is that they permit too many different possibilities, not all of which are at all congenial to us. And that matters. We should be concerned to promote a rich, diverse and vibrant biosphere. Human flourishing may certainly be included as a legitimate part of such a flourishing. The preoccupations of deep ecology arise as a result of human activities which impoverish and degrade the quality of the planet's living systems. But these judgments are possible only if we assume a set of values (that is, preference rankings), based on human preferences. We need to reject not anthropocentrism, but a particularly short term and narrow conception of human interests and concerns. What's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. We need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception. Our sort of world, with our sort of fellow occupants is an interesting and engaging place. There is every reason for us to try to keep it, and ourselves, going for a few more cosmic seconds.
Fenner says homo sapiens will not be able to survive the population explosion and “unbridled consumption,” and will become extinct, perhaps within a century, along with many other species. United Nations official figures from last year estimate the human population is seven billion, and is predicted to pass seven billion next year.
Against any superficial reduction of the thought of the author of Difference and Repetition (1994) to an avatar of multicultural doxa, the relevance of Deleuzian thought to such an event must be located elsewhere. A critical reading of the Haitian Revolution, as of any other moment in the critique of racism, colonisation or global capital, must take into account the a priori, transcendental determinants that allow for the taking place of such processes of subjection and exploitation, as well as the flight from those situations by novel subjects of emancipation (collective or individual), the becoming-minoritarian and becoming other, the subtractive politics of constituting other worlds. As Christian Kerslake (2009) has argued, Deleuze must be understood as a fundamentally post-Kantian philosopher, one whose ‘transcendental empiricism’ offers theoretical tools for escape from the various prison-houses of modern subjectivity of which race and colonialism are to be counted among the most vicious and dehumanising. A fully Deleuzian illumination of the Haitian Revolution would necessarily offer new modes of understanding the collective subjectivity of the half-million former slaves who, after 1791, accomplished the impossible, creating a ‘war machine’ in the precise sense Deleuze and Guattari (1987) give to the term in A Thousand Plateaus through the violent destruction of the striated, regimented space of domination that was the slave plantation system, and the creation of novel lines of maroon fight through a suddenly smooth space, across the plains of Northern Saint Domingue. Led by Toussaint Louverture, they then created a guerrilla, improvisatory form of warfare that, by 1804, defeated, for the first time, the most powerful army in the Atlantic world (see Louverture 2008). A critical Deleuzian reading of these events might go on to analyse the subsequent failure, after 1804, to sustain this becoming-minoritarian and dis-identifi cation from the representational apparatuses of racial stratification. It would elucidate the failures and unheralded successes in the struggle to avoid recapture by these dissident subjects (the moun en deyo or excluded Haitian peasant majority), as well as ‘microfascist’ tendencies within the new subjectification to power, both that of Toussaint Louverture’s dictatorial authoritarianism (1797–1802) and that of the Haitian state itself after 1804. A Deleuzian critique of Haitian decolonisation and racial dis-identification (the 1805 Haitian constitution, for example, identified all citizens of the new state as ‘black’, exploding through general banalisation the contemporary Atlantic racial regime) might go on to develop Deleuze’s concept of Masochian ‘dissidence’ (1991), underscoring the extent to which Toussaint, as much as Deleuze’s Masoch or Deleuze and Guattari’s Kafka, is the destroyer of Laws, of the Law of the Father, for Toussaint quite literally the Law of the Master that structures the world of plantation slavery. Masochism is for Deleuze an operation, a methodical political procedure. It is the enactment of a systematic subversion. Louverture put into practice with utter perfection the peculiar form of contractual sabotage of the rule of constituted law that Deleuze identifies as masochism. In other words, Toussaint destroyed the constituted laws of the post-1789 plantation by following through the logic of that world point by point, exploding it as the French Revolution had already done to the Ancien Régime, through faithful adherence to the formal stipulations of its ontological determination under the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (Louverture 2008). In these few years of 1791–1802, Toussaint moved from what Deleuze (1991) calls a ‘Socratic’ relation to the law, in which the law is an external, received model of the Good, the law of the plantation, Bréda, where Louverture manœuvred himself into relative freedom in an unfree world, to a Kantian one, collapsing some three thousand years of development into the flash of a moment. Toussaint instituted, above all in his 1801 constitution, what might be described as a destructive Kantian practice of dissidence, one in which, Deleuze says, law no longer has its foundation in some higher principle from which it would derive its authority, but that is self-grounded and valid solely by virtue of its own form. For the first time we can now speak of THE LAW, regarded as an absolute, without further specification or reference to an object. (1991: 82) Above all, perhaps, a Deleuzian critique of race and colonial exploitation would work to escape from the logic of identity and identification with one’s political and existential subjection at the heart of the Hobbesian narrative of political modernity. Deleuze’s critique of identity, above all in the first chapter of Difference and Repetition, ‘Difference in Itself’, addresses the common(-sensical) distribution of beings according to (Aristotelian, Leibnizian and Hegelian) categories and hierarchies, and the cognitive judgment of the propriety of any distribution or attribution of identity. In this conservative, sedentary distribution of roles and identities, ‘difference is in effect fully subject to the identity of the concept, the opposition of predicates, the analogy of judgment and the resemblance of perception’ (1994: 52). Instead, Deleuze compels us to think identity not as illusory attribution (including racial categorisation), but rather as the repetition of pure difference, to think the singularity of any entity in terms of its protean powers of transformation. Here, Deleuze envisages not only or even principally the transformation of any determinate being as a subtraction from actualised identities, but as the event he calls differentiation, the transformation of the virtual itself. Disidentification, in other words, is for Deleuze always and necessarily a critical process, in the Spinozian, Kantian and even Marxian sense (I am thinking here of the Marx of the ‘Theses on Feuerbach’), aiming at no less than the radical reformulation of the transcendental operators governing any world. The world-historical importance of the Haitian Revolution lies in its transcendence of any identity-based politics to politicise instead the Idea of the universal human right to be free from enslavement. This Idea of 1804 must be emphatically distinguished from any conscious articulation of a political doctrine by individual participants in the various revolts from 1791 on. Instead, universal emancipation, the idea of the Haitian Revolution, like any true Idea in Deleuze’s precise use of the concept, is preconscious, independent of its representation under the aegis of a reflexive cogito (1994: 214–79). The Idea of the Haitian Revolution as the pure multiplicity of a swarming war machine was arguably first actualised as a disembodied claim of absolute equality in the Bois Caïman ceremony and in Boukman’s famous call to the slaves to ‘Koute libete li pale nan kè nou tous’ (Listen to the voice of liberty that speaks in all our hearts’). The call for libete sparked a non-localisable chain of connections within an anonymous, enslaved multitude that enjoyed no place in their post-1789 world. Libete’s multiplicity linked up to a series of adjunct fields that further informed this pure Idea (including the unfulfilled promise of the incomplete and partial French and American Revolutions and the political implications of voodoo), and moved to operate a specific condensation or actualisation of the singular nature of their claim. This claim, as ideal, finding no identity or place in the world of Saint Domingue, focused around signifiers such as the creole libete. At the same time, it evinced an unsuspected power to enact, to unfold, and to dramatise on the world stage the implications of this Idea. This Idea was, in 1791, preconscious in Deleuze’s sense, literally a dream, in the way that we recall Martin Luther King’s celebrated phrase ‘I have a dream.’ This proto-Haitian multiplicity was self-defining. On the night of 29 August 1791, a massive uprising of some half-million slaves first began to actualise this pre-individual idea as a complex, unfolding differenctiation of relationships and elements. In fact, it would doubtless be more accurate to contrast in Deleuzian terms the formalised concept of 1804 (as the independent state of Haiti and its constitution) to the properly virtual Idea of the initial uprising of 1791, and, moreover, to conclude that 1804 represented, inevitably, an impoverishment of the Idea of 1791. The idea of universal emancipation was at first only a pure problem (inherent to that of actual slavery prior to the 1791 uprising), but quickly became the struggle to instantiate a real solution to that problem. This subtractive politics, one that violently withdrew from the Atlantic world-system of plantation slavery in a manner analogous to the Brazilian quilombos, culminated in the 1804 declaration of Haitian independence and the universal right of all humans to freedom from enslavement and racial subjection. To think with Deleuze the destruction of racial identity, of law, of subjection, and to trace and follow through the immanent lines of flight from those various regimes is in this sense to unfold the extraordinary potentiality of any pure differenctiation and becoming beyond the actual state of our human, all-too human, racialised being.
These findings underline the point that sexual health promotion in schools must include the teachers who will deliver programs. Many programs have tried to do this. For example, in Scotland the SHARE program collaborated with a respected sex education expert known to teachers in Scotland who became the first author on the finished program (Abraham et al., 2002). In addition, all teachers who delivered SHARE were provided with a 5-day course on how to deliver the program. During this course part-time teachers—paid for as part of the cost of program implementation—covered their other duties. Teachers’ evaluation of this training was overwhelmingly positive and the course was particularly successful at boosting the confidence of teachers who felt uncertain about their abilities at the outset (Buston, Wight, Hart, & Scott, 2002). Nevertheless, despite apparently successful training, some teachers remained reluctant to deliver key aspects of the program. For example, although the importance of student participation and the development of student self-efficacy had been emphasized, some teachers substituted a demonstration of how to use a condom for the student practice prescribed by the program. Many teachers also remained uncertain about managing role-play exercises in the classroom (Buston et al., 2002). This mirrors observations in The Netherlands (Paulussen et al., 1994) suggesting that key activities, such as condom demonstrations and roleplay exercises on sexual issues, are especially challenging for classroom teachers, probably because of a fear of losing control over their students.
We are taught since first grade that competition is good, greed is good. Competition most efficiently allocates resources and enables the best and brightest to rise to the top. Without competition we would not have a man on the moon or this computer. You know, I can live without this computer. I would probably be better off and the time will come for it to go. At some point I will have written enough and will just be a permaculture farmer teacher. Darwin’s theory of natural selection and survival of the fittest has contributed to a misunderstanding of how the world really works. Ecosystems survive through mutually beneficial cooperation not competition. If nature was based solely on competition, there would only be one survivor at the top of each food chain niche instead of the 30 million species alive today. It is physically impossible to have concentration of resources, material or financial, without war. Competition implies by definition that there will always be a winner and loser, someone at the top and many at the bottom. For the U.S. to consume more in total and per capita than any other national in the world, we must have the largest military in the world. McDonald’s goes where McDonald-Douglas goes, now Boeing. Put our lifestyle in the context of current local sunlight. If you cannot make it from local sunlight, you have to exploit and concentrate or take from somewhere else. If you cannot make a modern stick-frame home and everything that goes in it just from local sunlight, you need to get it’s components and the energy that it takes to build and maintain it from someplace else. It is simple laws of physics. Globalization is War War also comes in the form of colonization, occupation and corporations. For instance, building a railroad to send the Chinese people in and TIbetan natural resources out or as U.S. has recently done in Iraq. Tibetans will soon be a minority in their own country. Globalization is now a common form of low-level warfare. When the IMF and World Bank make loans, it forces the small third world countries to open their markets and sell their natural resources in order to pay the loans. Local farmers who had saved seeds for centuries are forced to go deeply into debt and buy seed and other inputs from Monsanto. Diversity in the food varieties we eat has disappeared. Free trade agreements enable large producers to leverage their size to put local farmers, manufacturers and merchants, out of business. Civilization has also waged a 10,000 year war on nature. In short, our one species is responsible for the single largest mass extinction since the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.
“Five-nine” doesn’t have quite the cadence as “nine-eleven,” but when we look back on the early 21st century, I believe that May 9, 2013 — the day the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million for the first time in recorded history — may in the future be understood as a far more important date than September 11, 2001. It may even be that 5/9 will be seen as the long-anticipated tipping point at which human impacts caused irrevocable harm to our planet. Or perhaps not. Perhaps there’s still time to take the concrete, immediate actions experts suggest — along the minimum efforts laid out in the 2015 Paris accord that amplified suggestions made by President Barack Obama in his June 25, 2013 speech at Georgetown University — that would ensure a sustainable, high-quality future. Tipping points are the cusp between one set of conditions and another; when a tipping point is passed, change is rapid, uncontrolled and often irreversible. Passing a tipping point is like crossing a threshold from one room to another and having the door triple-locked behind you; the state of the world after the tipping point is very different from the state of the world before the tipping point, and it is very difficult to go back. It’s important to make this distinction, because Malcolm Gladwell erroneously redefined tipping points more than a decade ago in his book, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference. In doing so, he changed the way we think about rapidly emerging social phenomena, such as the Dutch tulip frenzy, the housing bubble, or the re-emergence of a market for Hush Puppies. Although many have argued that the publication of The Tipping Point itself was a tipping point in how we think and talk about tipping points, Gladwell weakly equated tipping points with viral epidemics. This misleading analogy obscured the true meaning of “tipping point,” leading to confusion in how we think about responding to rapid environmental change. Epidemics, you see, require an initial infection in a particular individual, a pool of nearby people susceptible to the same infection, and a way for the disease to be transmitted to the susceptible individuals. Gladwell similarly invoked mavens, connectors and salesmen who collect and transmit new ideas to the wider world to explain the rapid emergence of new social phenomena. But this analogy doesn’t necessarily work; resistance evolves to new diseases, epidemics peak and burn out, and most new social phenomena are simply fads. In fact all of the examples in The Tipping Point — the sudden emergence of fax machines and Airwalk sneakers, the resurgence of sales of Hush Puppies suede shoes, the rise and fall of crime rate in many cities (that is rising once again in some), and sudden epidemics of suicides — are of explosions of interest in new phenomena followed by a return to the status quo ante and a search for the next new fad. But they are not tipping points. In contrast, economists, sociologists, historians, ecologists, climatologists, oceanographers and most others who for decades have given serious study to tipping points focus on rapid, seemingly permanent changes. In modern parlance, a tipping point presages a change in regime. And the prime example of a tipping point in the natural world is, many feel, climate change. Bill McKibben and the thousands of followers of 350.org working to solve the climate crisis assert that we passed a tipping point in the 1980s, when human industry caused the concentration of atmospheric CO2 to exceed 350 ppm: the so-called “safe” level of CO2 in the atmosphere. President Obama noted at Georgetown that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been measuring CO2 since the 1950s because of that agency’s even earlier concern that the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would disrupt the fragile balance of nature that makes our planet so hospitable to life and push us over the tipping point that leads to a planet beyond repair. So on 5/9 — when NOAA’s observatory atop Mauna Loa, Hawaii, recorded a concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that exceeded 400 parts per million (0.04 percent) for the first time in recorded history — a tipping point finally may have been passed. Although the deciduous forests of the northern hemisphere that provide New England with spectacular colors every fall will inhale some of that CO2 as they leaf out every spring, those great “lungs of the planet” cannot keep the CO2 in the atmosphere below 400 ppm. And even if an all-powerful deity were to manage to convince us to stop burning of all fossil fuels today, the “inertia” in the climate system would ensure that the Earth’s temperature would keep increasing and sea levels would continue to rise another meter or two over the next 2,000 years.  The inexorable warming of the planet caused by an ever-denser blanket of CO2 above us is not a fad — on 5/9, we passed a tipping point and entered a new world. This new reality is a consequence of our lifestyles intersecting with fundamental and unbreakable laws of physics. We simply need to own up to the fact that we are in a new climatic regime; global warming indeed is happening now. It’s not a short-term trend, and it’s not going away
The prime victim of the economic blockade has unquestionably been the Cuban people. The blockade affects the Cuban population without regard to sex, age, race, religion, political creed, or social position, not only because it attacks basic means of living but also because it undermines the possibility of intellectual development and the spiritual well-being of the Cuban family.¶ In this essay we shall focus on three important and sensitive aspects of the harm caused to Cuban families by the blockade: the food supply, health, and the negative consequences felt by women in Cuba. We shall stress the impact that economic sanctions have had in heightening the crisis during the nineties. For the moment we do not delve into other dimensions of the problem, which may be less visible but are no less relevant, such as the effect on education, culture, scientific activity, and quality of life, as well as a more personal impact felt by sectors of the population such as children and the elderly.¶ In our effort to present an objective analysis we have often relied on quantifying the most tangible effects from an economic perspective, yet even so it has not been possible to evoke the full effect of the havoc wrought by each of the factors described in the preceding section as a function of ensuring adequate food supplies and levels of health among the population. Moreover, the toll in terms of human suffering cannot be quantified nor estimated, and consequently we shall allow the historic events themselves to bear witness to what has transpired, running the risk perhaps that the anecdotal nature of the events reported may seem to render our analysis simplistic.
Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) confirmed what many advocates and experts feared—the American Health Care Act (AHCA) is bad news for Americans. The CBO’s latest estimate on the real-world effect of the AHCA finds that 23 million Americans would lose their health coverage by 2026. This estimate is due in large part because this bill decimates Medicaid, which helps children, seniors, and the disabled access health coverage. These cuts total an almost incomprehensible $834 billion and would force states to cut Medicaid benefits, cut enrollment in the program, or both. No state’s Medicaid program would be spared, and access to health care would be jeopardized for millions of people. Since 1965, Medicaid has essentially guaranteed that our most vulnerable have access to health coverage, and that need hasn’t changed today. Today, 74 million Americans, including 18 million Latinos, are enrolled in Medicaid, making the program the nation’s largest single source of health coverage. This program is a literal lifeline for the Latino community, as one in three Latinos rely on the program for access to health care, including 9.8 million Latino children. Several studies have shown Medicaid’s importance to children’s health and well-being. However, the AHCA willingly ensures a future where our children are less healthy today, and less able to pursue their dreams tomorrow. The AHCA’s effect would be felt beyond individual Medicaid enrollees. The sheer size of these cuts would have a tremendous impact on state budgets and the overall economy, as Medicaid is both a spending item and a major source of federal revenue for states. Nearly half of all federal funds spent by states go to their Medicaid programs, and states have no way to recoup billions of dollars in lost federal funds. If enacted, this bill would force states to significantly cut spending on health care as well as spending on other programs that we all count on, like education, transportation, and emergency services. The AHCA repeals every cent of federal funding for Medicaid expansion, ensuring that everyone who gained Medicaid through this pathway will lose coverage, and states that expanded the program will be left holding the bag. Medicaid expansion programs have provided access to health coverage for three million low-income Latino adults in the 31 states, plus DC, that have chosen to expand their programs. This has not only enabled millions of previously uninsured adults to access coverage, but has transformed state economies in the process. States that have enacted Medicaid expansion have realized budget savings, revenue gains, and overall economic growth. The AHCA would single-handedly cause millions of Latinos to lose their health coverage, and would completely reverse the painstaking progress we have made to reduce health inequities in our country. The AHCA’s Medicaid cuts harm our health, our economy, and our children’s future. This bill cuts access to health care for millions and decimates state budgets just to fund tax cuts for the wealthy.
As the prospects for passing comprehensive immigration reform dwindle in the House, Arizona Rep. Raúl Grijalva won’t hesitate to tell you exactly who he thinks deserves the blame.¶ ¶ “The House and its leadership is showing a tremendous lack of leadership,” said Grijalva on NewsNation Monday, taking a swipe at House Speaker John Boehner. “Boehner is not talking about a bipartisan bill that’s comprehensive, Boehner is not talking about bringing something to the floor so that the House can work its will,” he said. “We have a tough path ahead of us in the House.”¶ ¶ Following a closed-door meeting last week, participants told reporters that Republican leaders hoped to move forward with a variety of small bills dealing with certain aspects of immigration, but not a comprehensive package like the one the Senate passed last month. The House GOP has yet to figure out its position on the legal status of the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S.
What difference would any of this make? Why should Americans care if their country is no longer recognized as the most powerful and influential player in a region that is, after all, half a world away! Since the early part of the twentieth century an axiomatic goal of U.S. foreign policy under both Republican and Democratic administrations has been to prevent the domination of either end of the Eurasian landmass by one or more potentially hostile powers. The reasons for this have always involved a combination of economic, strategic, and ideological considerations. If Western Europe or East Asia were to fall under the sway of by unfriendly forces, the United States could find itself denied access to markets, technology, and vital resources. A hostile power or coalition might be able to draw on the wealth and military capabilities of the region under its control, using it as a secure base from which to challenge American interests and perhaps even to attack the United States itself. Last but by no means least, American statesmen have long been concerned about the implications for their vision of a freer world if Europe or Asia were to be "lost" to antidemocratic forces. These concerns are as valid today as they were one hundred years ago. If through inadvertence, error, or deliberate decision we permit China as presently constituted to dominate Asia, our prosperity, security, and hopes of promoting the further spread of freedom will be seriously impaired. Our businesses could find their access to the markets, high-technology products, and natural resources of some of the world's most dynamic economies constricted by trade arrangements designed to favor their Chinese counterparts. While it is unlikely to engage in outright military conquest, an unchecked China would be well situated to enforce claims over resources and territory that are currently disputed by its weaker neighbors. Control over the vast oil and gas reserves believed to lie beneath the South and East China Seas, plus assured access on favorable terms to energy imports from Central Asia and Russia, could greatly reduce Beijing's dependence on seaborne imports from the Persian Gulf and hence its vulnerability to a possible American (or Indian) naval blockade. With the United States gone from East Asia, China would be able to bring Taiwan to terms, and it would most likely be able to block, neutralize, or preempt the emergence of serious military challenges from Japan or South Korea. Freed of the necessity of defending against possible threats from its maritime periphery, Beijing would be able to devote more resources to setting terms with its continental neighbors and it would be able to more easily project military power to defend or advance its interests in other parts of the world. including the Middle East. Africa, and Latin America. Before it can hope to compete with the United States on a global scale, China must first establish itself as the foremost power in its own region. If Asia comes to be dominated by an authoritarian China, the prospects for liberal reform in any of its non-democratic neighbors will be greatly diminished. Even the region's established democracies could find themselves inhibited from pursuing policies, foreign and perhaps domestic as well, that might incur Beijing's wrath. With its enhanced global reach and influence, China would also be able to more effectively support nondemocratic regimes in other parts of the world and to present some variant of its own internal arrangements as a viable alternative to the liberal democratic capitalism of the West. Former prime minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew has observed that "the 21st century will be a contest for supremacy in the Pacific because that's where the growth will be .... If you do not hold your ground in the Pacific you cannot be a world leader."2 Lee is right: if we permit an illiberal China to displace us as the preponderant player in this most vital region, we will face grave dangers to our interests and our values throughout the world. My purpose in writing this book is to warn of a serious and fastgrowing challenge, to explain its sources, describe its manifestations, and outline the policies by which it can best be met.
Critics of sweatshops frequently ground their protests in appeals to human dignity and human rights. Arguably, Kantian ethics provides a philosophical basis for such moral pronouncements. The key principle here is Kant's second formulation of the categorical imperative: "Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only."^ The popular expression of this principle is that morality requires that we respect people. One significant feature of the idea of respect for persons is that its derivation and application can be assessed independently of other elements of Kantian moral philosophy. Sympathetic readers need not embrace all aspects of Kant's system of ethics in order to grant the merit of Kant's arguments for the second formulation of the categorical imperative.'^ This is because Kant's defense of respect for persons is grounded in the uncontroversial claim that humans are capable of rational, self-governing activity. We believe that individuals with a wide range of theoretical commitments can and should recognize the force of Kant's arguments concerning respect for persons. Kant did not simply assert that persons are entitled to respect, he provided an elaborate argument for that conclusion. Persons ought to be respected because persons have dignity. For Kant, an object that has dignity is beyond price. Employees have a dignity that machines and capital do not have. They have dignity because they are capable of moral activity. As free beings capable of self governance they are responsible beings, since freedom and self-governance are the conditions for responsibility. Autonomous responsible beings are capable of making and following their own laws; they are not simply subject to   the causal laws of nature. Anyone who recognizes that he or she is free should recognize that he or she is responsible (that he or she is a moral being). As Kant argues, the fact that one is a moral being entails that one possesses dignity.
North Korea’s provocations have prompted critical changes in alliance priorities, activities, and investments, particularly in the area of BMD, and have played a forceful role in driving Japan’s security policy, usually pushing Japanese leaders to pursue, and the public to accept, a more forward-leaning defense posture. After the Cold War threat from the Soviet Union receded, many analysts questioned whether the pacifist-leaning Japanese public would support a sustained military alliance with the United States. The shared threat from North Korea—particularly acute to geographically proximate Japan—appeared to shore up the alliance in the late 1990s and into the next century. North Korea’s 1998 test of its first multistage rocket over Japan consolidated support for BMD cooperation with the United States. In 2001, the Japan Coast Guard’s sinking of a North Korean spy ship that had entered Japan’s exclusive economic zone again publicly raised the specter of the threat from Pyongyang. Perhaps most importantly, the admission by Kim Jong- il in 2002 that North Korea had abducted several Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s shocked the Japanese public and led to popular support for a hardline stance on North Korea.55 This in turn helped give rise to hawkish political figures, including Abe when he served as Chief Cabinet Secretary to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi from 2005 to 2006. In 2003, Japan launched its first spy satellite in order to track North Korean threats without relying on other countries’ intelligence collection. From 2006 to 2017, North Korea’s behavior—repeated missile launches, six tests of nuclear devices, and its sinking of a South Korean warship and artillery attack on South Korea’s Yeonpyeong Island in 2010—spurred Japanese leaders to pursue more robust missile defense cooperation with the United States. Japanese territory is well within the range of North Korean Nodong ballistic missiles, which are potentially capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.56 Given that U.S. military bases in Japan would play an important supporting role in a conflict on the Korean peninsula, many experts expect that Japan would be a target of North Korean missile attacks in a major crisis situation. Pyongyang’s provocations also drove Seoul, Tokyo, and Washington to closer defense cooperation, including combined military exercises and high-level trilateral dialogues. Japan was a strong supporter of the 2016-2017 U.S.-led “maximum pressure” campaign that aimed to squeeze the Pyongyang regime through robust international sanctions. Abe also supported Trump’s “all options on the table” approach, suggesting that Japan would support the use of military force against North Korea. As the crisis defused in 2018 and the Trump Administration pursued a diplomatic path, diplomatic strains emerged as the United States, South Korea, and Japan approached the situation differently. The cancellation of large-scale bilateral military exercises between the United States and South Korea led Japanese officials to signal concerns about U.S. military readiness.57
The world is changing in ways that dictate that U.S. nuclear policy and posture also change.¶ The renewal of competition among the major states, the shifts of power in the international¶ system away from traditional U.S. allies and toward some potential U.S. adversaries, and¶ the narrowing of U.S. nonnuclear military advantages all mean that the United States needs¶ to reexamine and revise its nuclear policy and posture. The NPR likely to be mandated by¶ Congress for the next administration offers an excellent opportunity to do just this, and to do¶ so while many of the trends demanding this reexamination are evident but still inchoate and¶ susceptible to more effective counteraction by the United States. The United States should¶ therefore grasp this opportunity to adapt its nuclear policy and posture, maintaining U.S.¶ strategic advantages and mitigating vulnerabilities and weaknesses where possible.¶ It is worth explaining why this is not only important but also justified to do so, for nuclear¶ weapons are terrible weapons capable of killing large numbers of people in short¶ order. Any substantial modernization of such arms requires a rationale beyond the desire¶ of a nation to maintain primacy, bureaucratic inertia, or pride. The modernization program¶ laid out in this document does have such a rationale. And that is that U.S. nuclear¶ weapons continue to offer the prospect of deterring major aggression against not only the¶ United States but also a wide range of like-minded states, and doing so with unique efficacy.¶ The modernization program here is offered in the hopes of making this most formidable¶ of deterrents as effective in the future as it has been since its inception, a 75-year¶ period correlated with an unprecedented abeyance of major power war and the protection,¶ maturation, and expansion of free systems of sociopolitical organization. If the United¶ States continues to use its nuclear forces as the cornerstone of its own security and the¶ security of its like-minded allies and partners, and thinks about how to use those forces¶ sternly but responsibly, then a modernization program that will make that deterrent more¶ effective in a new era is not just defensible. It is actually incumbent upon the country to¶ support it.
As explained in the Introduction, in a 2013 article I analyzed how a preference for local control and a limited federal role in education have functioned as one of several critical roadblocks to three of the primary reforms that promote equal educational opportunity: school desegregation, school finance litigation in federal court, and NCLB.' For instance, key Supreme Court decisions, from the 1974 decision in Milliken v. Bradley to the 1995 decision in Missouri v. Jenkins, relied on the structure of federalism and the American tradition of local control of education as one of the reasons for severely curtailing the authority of courts to ensure effective school desegregation.1 0 2 In so doing, these opinions clung to a form of dual federalism that required separate spheres for certain government functions, and thus insisted that education was solely a state and local function. 03 However, dual federalism had already been eschewed in prior Court decisions that prohibited segregated educational systems, and in federal legislation and enforcement that provided additional federal funding for low-income students and that required equal educational opportunity for girls, women, disabled students, and English language students.104 Similarly, the Supreme Court relied upon education federalism as one of several justifications for rejecting a federal right to education in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez.05 The Court noted that it lacked the expertise to interfere with state and local education judgments (an objection that did not stop the Court from deciding Brown) regarding the most effective education reforms and the connection between funding and educational quality.' 06 The Court's rationale also highlighted the importance of local control of schools and the values it brings, such as tailoring programs to students' needs and experimentation.' 07 The Court insisted that it did not want to disturb the existing balance of power between the federal and state governments by reaching a decision that essentially would result in striking down school finance systems throughout the United States. 08 Thus, the Court's decision privileged federalism interests over the nation's interest in equal educational opportunity and insulated school finance disparities from federal judicial review.'09
Venezuela has taken positions on proliferation issues that run directly against the mainstream of international public opinion, pursuing a highly publicized rapprochement with Iran, a potential nuclear supplier, and supporting both Iran‟s right to pursue nuclear technology without constraints and North Korea‟s periodic missile tests. It has also opposed international sanctions over nuclear issues on both powers.11 Venezuela‟s stated concern of a U.S. invasion has led it to officially orient its Armed Forces towards a policy of prolonged popular war and asymmetric warfare. This has translated into changes in doctrine and educational programs, and the creation of a militia.12 Certainly, nuclear forces would be the ultimate deterrent against outside intervention. Taken together, these factors have led some outside observers to claim that Venezuela is a potential nuclear proliferation risk. If we evaluate the contemporary domestic and international political context, it seems unlikely. At the international level, Argentina and Brazil have reacted very cautiously to the Venezuelan nuclear proposal. On the one hand, they would like the business for economic reasons, but on the other they are concerned about Chávez‟s ambitions. As members of the NPT and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSP), Argentina and Brazil are likely to insist on strong international safeguards on any nuclear technology sold to Caracas.13 However, neither the Argentine nor the Brazilian governments have opposed Venezuela‟s nuclear ambitions publicly, both because they are vulnerable domestically on their left flank, where Hugo Chávez has numerous sympathizers, and because internationally they still have common economic interests with Venezuela.
Amidst the flurry of bilateral visits and announcements, it is also easy to overstate what Russia is offering to Egypt. Russia's loans, which Egypt must repay, are not substitutes for U.S. grant assistance, and Russia is not in the same position as the United States to facilitate Egypt’s entrée into European capitals and international financial institutions. What Egypt needs is private investment and lots of it—not what Putin can provide. Additionally, it is not easy to switch military operating systems on a dime, especially after four decades of Egypt relying on American equipment and training in all areas except for missile defense. Also, Putin has not been as unconditionally supportive of Sisi as some would suggest, nor has Sisi welcomed all of Putin’s overtures. Putin is holding out on restoring all Russian commercial flights to Egypt, cut off since the disastrous October 2015 terrorist bombing of a Russian jet that departed from Sharm al-Shaykh. Putin recently agreed to allow flights to Cairo, but not yet to the Red Sea beach airports, which were the principal attraction for Russian tourists who used to travel to Egypt in droves. For his part, Sisi seems to be holding out on a Russian request for access to Egypt’s military airfields—perhaps because it would jeopardize his relations with the U.S. military. But what if the U.S.-Egyptian military relationship did fall apart for whatever reason, and Sisi sought to compensate by openly allying with Russia? On the surface, this would look like another retreat of the United States from its once-dominant position in the region. But on a practical level, the impact on U.S. interests would be much less than it once would have been. Due to years of internal erosion of the Egyptian state, it is a less capable regional actor than it was several decades ago and its military is a poor reflection of the force that acquitted itself well in 1973. The Jordanian and Emirati militaries, for example, are now far more capable of projecting power within the region and are more interoperable with U.S. forces than are the Egyptians. Excepting Libya, which is more important to European than U.S. interests, Egypt has been unwilling to deploy its forces abroad. Power in the region has shifted to the Gulf, as economic influence has become increasingly important, while other Arab and North African countries have come to eclipse Egypt in areas such as human development. And, while the Trump administration seems to believe Egypt is key to Israeli-Palestinian peace, neither Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is likely to move off of avowed redlines at Sisi’s request. The Israeli-Egyptian Treaty of Peace is on firm footing and the bilateral relationship, warm at the official level and cool at the popular level, is no longer dependent on U.S. encouragement or management. Egypt would most likely continue to allow U.S. ships access to the Suez Canal, for which the U.S. Navy pays handsomely. Egypt might deny overflight and landing rights to U.S. military aircraft, but those are much less valuable than they once were as the United States continues to entrench its position in Qatar. Arab states’ more relaxed attitude towards Israel also could open up new routes for civilian and military aircraft alike. Finally, it is hard to assess the net value of Egyptian counterterrorism (CT) cooperation with Washington, but we know that Egyptian policies are in some ways making the terrorism problem worse and it is in Cairo’s interest to maintain its own CT operations, whatever the state of relations with the United States. The real danger for the United States is not that it might lose Egypt, but that this nation of nearly one hundred million could sink into obscurity or even state failure due to poor governance, rapid population growth, and economic fragility. That would be unfortunate because a strong Egypt could serve as an important source of stability in the Middle East. But competing with Moscow for Egypt’s fealty is not going to reverse the country’s decline. Indeed, by pandering to Sisi and his misguided policies out of fear that he might turn to Russia, the United States would only be increasing the likelihood of such dark outcomes. Egypt is no longer a strategic prize for the United States or Russia to win. It is a challenge to be managed through careful, and where necessary coercive, diplomacy.
The 911 emergency response system, a specialized communications network that relies on local telephone service, is also a favorite target for theorists of cyber-terrorism, but like other infrastructures, it is a robust target. The U.S. for example, does not use a single 911 system in but instead has several thousand local systems using different technologies and procedures. No 911 system in a major city has been hacked. It might be possible to send a flood of email messages instructing people to call 911 for important information and thus overload the system (this was the technique used in the 1997 U.S. cyber exercise “Eligible Receiver”). This sort of technique usually works only once - but made in conjunction with a bombing or other physical attack they could act as a ‘force multiplier’ for a terrorist event.
In this chapter I argue that information technologies are profoundly political instruments implicated in the fortification of external borders of the Western world. Moreover, coupled with biometric technologies, the various systems in use for regulating border traffic, border patrol, immigration, and asylum policy establish forms of identity politics that transform geographical borders into lived and embodied identities. The next section describes some of the changing practices and policies regarding the United States–Mexico border and one of the EU’s external borders, the Germany–Poland border, until the accession of ten new member states on May 1, 2004. The third section describes how, specifically in Europe, one traditional way to enter the first world legally, the application for political asylum, is gradually blocked, leaving many refugees little option but to join the ranks of the criminalized “illegal aliens,” or les sans-papiers. The central role of two biometric databases in this process, IDENT and Eurodac, is also described. The fourth section is concerned with the contrasting type of system, the one that allows specific groups of people to pass the border more easily. Here, it is argued, the use of information technologies and biometrics, such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service Passenger Accelerated Service System (INSPASS), dedicated commuter lane (DCL), and secure electronic network for travelers rapid inspection (SENTRI) in the United States, are inscribing identities on bodies as well, but with somewhat different results. The final section discusses the way information technologies, and biometrics in particular, constitute increased levels of surveillance for both Western citizens and non-Western immigrants, refugees, and visitors in ways that more often than not are practically immune to democratic controls. In that sense, the informatization of the border is generally problematic. However, the different identities produced in this generalized surveillance require a careful differential assessment of the politics of technological identification rather than a treatment of it in general terms as one phenomenon.
Racial oppression works on multiple axes, I would argue, with color being the most dominant and currently most pernicious. But color is not exhaustive of all the forms racial oppression can take. The most pejorative terms used against Asian Americans often have a racial connotation but without a color connotation – “Chinks,” “slant-eyes,” and for the Vietnamese, “gooks.” These terms denigrate a whole people, not a particular set of customs or a specific history, and thus parallel the essentializing move of racist discourse that universalizes negative value across a group that is demarcated on the basis of visible features. The two most pejorative terms widely used against Latino/as in this country have been the terms “spic” – whose genealogy references people who were heard by Anglos as saying “no spic English” – and “wetback.” The first invokes the denigration of language, the second denigrates both where people came from and how they got here: from Mexico across the Rio Grande. Mexican Americans were also called “greasers” which connoted the condition of their hair, not their skin color. Thus, these terms demonstrate the possibility of a racialization and racism that works through constructing and then denigrating other racialized features and characteristics besides color. We might think of these as two independent axes of racialization that operate through physical features other than color, and through genealogies of cultural origin. There is, then, the color axis, the physical characteristics other than color axis, and the cultural origin axis. The discrimination against Asian Americans and Latino/as has also operated very strongly on a fourth axis of “nativism.” Nativism is a prejudice against immigrants; thus it is distinct, though often related to, xenophobia or the rejection of foreigners. Rodolfo Acuña explains that historical nativism is also distinct from anthropological nativism, which refers to a “revival of indigenous culture,” because historical nativism refers to the belief of some Anglo-Americans that they are “the true Americans, excluding even the Indian” because they represent in their cultural heritage the “idea” of “America.”31 On this view, the problem with Asian Americans and Latino/as is not just that they are seen as foreign; they are seen as ineluctably foreign, from inferior cultures (morally and politically if not intellectually), incapable of and unmotivated toward assimilation to the superior mainstream white Anglo culture. They want to keep their languages, demand instruction in public schools in their primary languages, and they often maintain their own holidays, cuisines, religions, and living areas (the latter sometimes by choice). Despite the fact that Mexican Americans have been living within the current U.S. borders for longer than most Anglo-Americans, they are all too often seen as squatters on U.S. soil, interlopers who “belong” elsewhere. This “xenophobia directed within” has been especially virulent at specific times in U.S. history, during and after both world wars for example, and is enjoying a resurgence now with the war fever and hysteria against Arabs or anyone wearing a turban, the serious erosion of civil liberties for racially profiled groups, the political rhetoric of Pat Buchanan, the right wing disc-jockeys who make jokes about beating up illegal immigrants, and the “scholarly” best-selling books like Alien Nation that warn “Americans” that their loose immigration laws will forever alter the racial make-up of the U.S. if left unchecked, and that altering our racial identity will have the dire consequences of undermining the basic cultural and democratic values that make the U.S. what it is. Another feature of nativism is its use to justify claims of differential rights for various minority groups. In my view, there is no question that African Americans together with American Indians have a moral claim on this country larger than any group, and that the redress made thus far is completely inadequate toward repairing the present inequities that persist as a legacy of past state-organized mass atrocities. Some may believe that a kind of nativist argument would provide further justification for these legitimate claims to redress, on the grounds that these groups’ forbears were here longer and/or their labor and ingenuity contributed a great deal to the wealth of this country. More recent immigrants, it may be thought, “deserve” less by way of protected opportunities or government assistance. The issue of nativism is thus important to address in relation to the differences and potential conflicts among communities of color, since many Asian Americans and Latino/as are post-1965 immigrants (when the restrictions on immigration based on geography were lifted). One might well ask, what is wrong with nativist arguments, and is the critique of nativism based ultimately on group self-interest? There are both consequentialist and non-consequentialist arguments one can make against nativism. The principle consequentialist argument against using nativism to justify differential rights is that it will produce (or in reality, merely maintain) a hierarchy of first and second class citizens. This is both undemocratic and undesirable as the kind of community many would want to live in. Nativist rhetoric has already justified state orchestrated murders and other horrors at the U.S.–Mexican border, a border that the current U.S. President announced he would arm even further (using the Texas Rangers, who were disarmed in the 1920s after it came to light that they had lynched hundreds and perhaps thousands of Mexican Americans without trial).32 Nativist arguments might well tend to encourage people to turn a blind eye to what happens at the border. And moreover, such enforced hierarchies of status within a society must surely share responsibility for creating the problems of crime and social insecurity that adversely affect everyone. These provide consequentialist arguments against nativism based on its subsequent effects on the U.S., but one might also make nonconsequentialist arguments against nativism. The logic of nativism is based on the idea that those native to this country “deserve” more, not just because they have been here longer (in which case all land claims by Native American groups would have to be immediately settled in their favor), but because they or their relatives contributed the labor and ingenuity that made the U.S. wealthy. There are several arguments one could make against this view. One might first want to point out that there are numerous groups within the U.S. that contributed labor and ingenuity toward the country’s wealth and that have not received any approximation of fair compensation. But one could also argue that the wealth of the U.S. has been the product in no small part of neo-colonial and imperial global relations that ensured the extraction of natural resources at a price U.S. companies determined, as well as super-exploitation of labor (i.e., a much larger extraction of surplus value) that produced the capital brought back here. The building of the Panama Canal gives just one small but clear example. The U.S. contributed capital and some of the engineers for the project, helped to plan a coup to separate the country off from Colombia, who would have been a much more powerful negotiating adversary, and manufactured a treaty which no Panamanian signed that guaranteed that the entire profits from the canal would go to the U.S. “in perpetuity.” Not only did the treaty guarantee capital flight, it gave the U.S. complete political autonomy over the canal zone, cutting right through the heart of Panama and thus splitting it in half. The U.S. was also given the right to intervene with military force whenever it unilaterally determined that canal security was at stake, a proviso that had major negative effects on the political developments in the country and in particular in the development of social justice movements. The people who actually labored to build the canal, enticed from the West Indies and Asia as well as local people, were paid 10 cents a day and died from yellow fever in tens of thousands.33 Nonetheless, anti-treaty rhetoric in the U.S. persist in calling it “our canal.”
Engagement is a process of strategic interaction.  It is the use of non-coercive diplomatic tools and initiatives to elicit cooperative behavior from the target state and to develop norms of diffuse reciprocity.  Engagement generally aims to ameliorate the dissatisfied or revisionist inclinations of the problem state in a manner that is consistent with peaceful change in the existing order.  Unlike containment, this can be done through: (1) accommodation of the target state’s interests (regardless of normative consideration); (2) an “enmeshing” of the state in international institutions upon which its well-being becomes based; and (3) the growth of a variety of transitional linkages that transform the preferences of the state.  In the end, the engagement
And what if the technology had already gotten positive reviews from the American Nuclear Society, the World Nuclear Association and, in particular, from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the world's nuclear watchdog, which, in a 2005 report titled Thorium Fuel Cycle -- Potential Benefits and Challenges, called it "an attractive way to produce long-term nuclear energy with low radiotoxicity waste?" You'd have the nuclear equivalent of unleaded gas, in Grae's analogy. Glancing around the room with a small smile, Grae is more than ready for skepticism. He's heard it many times over the years while explaining the new nuclear fuel that his company, the Northern Virginia-based Thorium Power Ltd., has been testing in Russia for several years and that he says will be ready to license for commercial use within a decade. One banker says flatly that many investors believe nuclear power, any nuclear power, is an "outdated technology." Grae, 46, who holds both law and business degrees, answers smoothly, occasionally deferring to Thomas Graham Jr., a courtly Kentuckian who is the company's executive chairman of the board and a retired ambassador. During his long State Department career, Graham participated in the negotiation of every major arms control and nonproliferation agreement drawn up over about three decades. (Hans Blix, who was director general of the IAEA and the United Nations' chief weapons inspector for Iraq from 2000 to 2003, is a senior adviser to the company.) By the time Graham excuses himself to attend another meeting, almost every question has been put to rest, it seems, but one: How come no one's heard of this technology?
There are three key points I want to make concerning the “opt out” movement: In regards to standardized testing being “too frustrating” for our students and thus we should avoid at all cost, I know countless teachers who see the frustration on their students’ faces as not just defeat but rather persistence and resilience. Yes, tests are difficult, but with time, patience, practice and yes teaching (both from parents and educators) it gets better. Are there better ways to demonstrate academic competency, yes. We should do everything within our power to ensure that our students excel on the current incarnation of test, even as we strive to change the system. What message are we sending to children of this generation if we insist that if something is “too hard,” they can “opt out?” It is already bad enough that there is a false sense of accomplishment with this generation receiving awards for simply showing up and participating on the soccer field and expecting that if they do the same in the classroom, their simple attendance equals positive academic achievement. We are doing a disservice to students in public education when we blindly aim towards the unattainable goal of 100% proficiency (which, according to NCLB was supposed to have been met by 2014). In instances such as this, we are fraught with an environment in which cheating and gaming the system overtake actual student learning and achievement. A more pragmatic approach would be to prepare students through rigorous coursework and less emphasis on test preparation to aim for high achievement and excellence, even if they never achieve 100% proficiency. Critics of high-stakes testing, of which, ironically, I count myself as one, usually deride that; ‘high-stakes testing culture has eliminated all the fun out of teaching. I don’t know why anyone would get into the profession.’ In my current position as an instructor in a Teachers College, I am constantly reminding pre-service teachers, as well as those already in their own classrooms, of the frequently articulated refrain that teaching is considered by many to be both as much an “art as it is a science.” With that said, we cannot always reside in the art part of our lessons, sometimes there are hard science lessons we need to instill in our students. Unfortunately, testing is one of those science parts of our job. We must work diligently to improve the metrics we give our students. We must cease to depend on independent testing companies who want to “data mine” our students. We must continue to make these tests measure what students actually know rather than try to play gotcha. We must continue to decouple these test scores with exclusively determining a teacher’s “worth” or worse, employment status. We must continue to make these exams less culturally biased. Can these diagnostics be improved? Absolutely. But we are fooling ourselves if we think that students should not have any quantitative measures of identifying academic growth – even flawed ones such as the current iterations of high-stakes testing. As such, we must continue to have high expectations of our students and their academic achievement, while also working to dismantle the current toxic high-stakes testing environment. The articulation of the science component stems from the process of failing, learning from ones mistakes, retrying from the beginning, and ultimately succeeding – in other words the implementation of scientific inquiry. Students are not supposed to be proficient on their first try, or maybe their second. However, if we encourage them to simply “opt out” they are never going to learn. Critics contend that that this process takes the joy out of teaching and learning. I’m sorry, from my perspective that is exactly where the joy is. What is unfortunate is that we are so deep in a contaminated era of mistrust and fear that many are afraid to even think of how to better prepare students for these exams. Rather, many feel that the oppressive and ineffective test preparation (e.g. “drill and kill”) is the only way. What is interesting is when we examine any high performing, high socio-economic public school across the country, we will see that they rarely if ever focus on test preparation to the extent that underperforming, lower socio-economic public schools do.
I have worked in various political venues on welfare issues forty years-for about as long as I have been researching and writing about women and U.S. social policy.' Most recently, I worked as a Steering Committee member and co-chair of the Women's Committee of 100, a feminist mobilization against punitive welfare reform. I signed up with the Women's Committee of 100 in March or April of 1995-roughly a year after completing a book on welfare policy history and around the same time as the book's publication. I have always done both politics and scholarship, so directing my activism toward my field of professional expertise at first did not seem especially odd or problematic. However, I had just published a book critical of experts like me-a book which, among other things, faulted solipsistic women welfare innovators of the early twentieth century for building a welfare state harmful to women and to gender equality. The book was barely between covers, and I had already embarked on a path of policy advocacy that veered disturbingly close to the reformers I had criticized. There I was, consorting with a group of supereducated, do-good feminists, most of whom would never need a welfare check. And there we were, using our social and professional positions to gain entry into congressional offices, where we spoke against reforms that would affect not us but poor women. It seemed to me that maybe I hadn't really internalized the lessons I had drawn from early-twentieth-century welfare history. I struggled a bit with my own contradictions-between whatI felt compelled to do as a feminist activist confronted by the political crisis of welfare reform and what I had cautioned against as a student of elite women reformers. But I didn't have to struggle long. It quickly became apparent that any historical analogies I feared were the product of academic overinterpretation. An awesome collection of women makes up the Committee of 100-none of whom, to my knowledge, has any interest in mothering the poor as our forebears did earlier in the century and all of whom reject the morally and culturally prescriptive politics of early-twentieth-century welfare innovation and of late-twentieth-century welfare reform. We mobilized not to speak for poor mothers but with them to speak for ourselves as feminists frustrated by the absence of women's voices and by the lack of gender equality concerns in the welfare debate. Although members of Congress paid scant attention, in our lobbying, letter writing, and media efforts, we repeatedly explained how welfare reform risks many of the rights and protections upon which women's security and equality depends. Often speaking of "welfare as a women's issue," we argued that "a war against poor women is a war against all women." This was a strategically clever rallying cry, but it failed to rally many women-even feminists. In fact, the war against poor women was just that: a war against poor women. And it was a war in which many middle-class women participated on the antiwelfare side. All but one woman in the U.S. Senate supported the Personal Responsibility Act when it first was aken up in the summer of 1995. In 1996, twenty-six of thirty one Democratic women in the House of Representatives voted for their party's substitute bill, which, like the Personal Responsibility Act, stripped poor single mothers of their entitlement to welfare. Meanwhile, across the country, a National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund appeal for contributions to support an economic justice litigator aroused so much hate mail that NOW LDEF stopped doing direct mail on the welfare issue. Although the feminist Women's Committee of 100 campaigned ardently against the welfare bill, Republicans won their war against poor single mothers with the complicity of millions of other feminists. Feminist members of Congress did not write the Personal Responsibility Act, of course. Nor did NOW members or contributors to Emily's List comprise the driving force behind the most brutal provisions of the new welfare law. My point is not that feminists were uniquely responsible for how Congress reformed welfare. It is that they were uniquely positioned to make a difference. We have made a difference in many arenas across the years, even during inauspicious Republican presidencies-reforming rape laws, winning recognition of sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination, and securing passage of a federal law against domestic violence. Feminists certainly could have made a difference when a friendly Democratic president began casting about for ways to reform welfare in 1993; and although we could not have changed Republican intentions in the 104th Congress, we surely could have pressured the Democrat we helped elect to the White House to veto the Republican bill. In the absence of widespread feminist opposition to the welfare reform principles of the Personal Responsibility Act, the legislative record is devoid of a counternarrative that might temper administrative and judicial enforcement of the new law. Moreover, it is devoid of any discursive precedent for women friendly, equality-enhancing amendments to the new law. Because most feminists did not contest or disturb the Republican welfare paradigm, about all they can do now to fix the new welfare mess is urge that more money be spent on job training and childcare and that broader exceptions for battered women be adopted. These are important goals, but they do not repair the damage wrought by the new welfare law on the lives and rights of poor single mothers. Why were so many feminists unconcerned that welfare reform not only repealed poor single mothers' entitlement to cash assistance but encroached on their basic civil rights as well? Given the degree of harm inflicted on poor single mothers by the new welfare law, why were there no candlelight vigils like there were against O.J. Simpson? Why were there no marches like there have been to defend Roe v. Wade? Why were no boycotts waged like there were against the film The People vs. Larry Flynt? These questions are the fruit of my frustration as a welfare activist. They have renewed my scholarly attention to the relationship between welfare and equality, on the one hand, and etween welfare and feminism, on the other. Out of these concerns has emerged a new scholarly project... a new book. The book is a broadside against the Personal Responsibility Act, culminating in defense of welfare. It is also a call to middle class feminists to practice true "sisterhood": by upholding poor mothers' rights as we do our own. Although the Personal Responsibility Act deserves boundless criticism for its seismic practical consequences-for driving a million more children into poverty, for example-my book is concerned less with the economic than with the political impact of welfare reform. The new welfare law distinguishes poor single mothers as a separate caste, subject to a separate system of law. Poor single mothers are the only people in America forced by law to work outside the home. They are the only people in America whose decisions to bear children are punished by government. They are the only people in America of whom government may demand the details of intimate relationships. And they are the only mothers in America compelled by law to make room for biological fathers in their families. Based on lessons drawn from eighteen months of struggle against the Personal Responsibility Act, one of my goals in the book is to defend welfare as an affirmative right of poor single mothers, a right backed up by the reproductive, associational, family, and vocational rights assured to all persons under the Constitution. Toward this end, I argue that welfare (by which I mean income support for caregivers) is a condition of women's equality (by which I mean full and independent citizenship). Without welfare, mothers who work inside the home are deprived of equal citizenship, for they alone are not paid for their labor. Moreover, lacking earnings for their economic and social contributions, women who work full- or part-time as caregivers for their children are ideologically unequal in a political culture that prizes income-producing work as the currency of virtue. Further, unwaged mothers do not have marital freedom: lacking the financial means to exit marriages, they lack the freedom to choose to stay in them. When they do dare to exit or avoid marriage, mothers do not enjoy vocational liberty: unpaid for their work in the home, they are forced either by law or by economic circumstance to choose wages over children. We should not think of welfare as a subsidy for dependence but as insurance for the rights that comprise independence. Nor should we think of welfare as an income substitute for the wage earned by breadwinners-fathers-in the labor market. Rather, we should reconceive welfare as the income owed to persons who work inside the home caring for, nurturing, and protecting children-mothering. The idea that welfare should support mothers in their caregiving roles should not be terribly controversial. This was a core premise of mothers' pension programs early in the century and a justification for including Aid to Dependent Children in the New Deal's Social Security Act. The problem is that the caregiving work performed by poor mothers has lost its luster over the past thirty years; who welfare mothers are explains why. In the popular imagination, welfare participants are reckless breeders who bear children to avoid work. Such vintage stereotypes have bipartisan roots and were popularized beginning in the 1960s by Republican Richard Nixon, southern Democrat Russell Long, and sometime Democrat George Wallace. Even Lyndon Johnson, often credited for expanding welfare as part of his War on Poverty, shared these views: he called for limits on payments to nonmarital children and complained that their mothers "sit around and breed instead of going out to work."' Into the 1990s, the racial mythology of welfare cast the welfare mother as Black, pinned the need for reform on her character, and at least implicitly defined Black women as other peoples' workers rather than their own families' mothers. Racially charged images of lazy, promiscuous, and matriarchal women have dominated welfare discourse for quite some time, inflaming demands that mothers who need welfare-although perhaps not their children-must pay for their improvident behavior through work, marriage, or destitution. If racism has permitted policymakers to negate poor single mothers as mothers, middle-class feminism has provided them an excuse. New attitudes about wage earning by mothers amplified by successful feminist challenges to employment discrimination have turned work outside the home into a rhetorical resource for critics of welfare. Middle-class feminists' emphasis on women's right to work outside the home also has inflected welfare politics among women, diminishing the scale of coalitions for welfare justice-especially by comparison to coalitions for abortion rights or against rape or domestic violence. This created something of a vacuum in the defense of poor mothers' political and economic rights. Part of the problem, I think, is that white and middle-class feminists-who are the mainstream of the women's movement view mothers who need welfare as mothers who need feminism. They see welfare mothers as victims-of patriarchy, maybe of racism, possibly of false consciousness. They don't see welfare mothers as feminist agents of their own lives-as women who are entitled to and capable of making independent and honorable choices about what kind of work they will do and how many children they will have and whether they will marry. As a result, when many white, middle-class feminists weighed into the welfare debate, it was to prescribe reforms to assimilate welfare mothers to white feminists' own goals-principally, independence through paid employment. Most of the policy claims made by Second-Wave feminists have emphasized women's right to participate in men's world and have made work outside the home a defining element for women's full and equal citizenship. Middle-class feminists responded to their particular historical experiences, experiences drawn by an ethos of domesticity which confined middle-class women to the home. From this perspective, the home is the site of oppression for women, while the labor market is potentially liberating. But when middle-class women moved into the labor market, they did not trade in their caregiving obligations. Now doubly taxed by the dual responsibilities of earning and caring, many feminists have demanded labor market policies to address the family needs that fall disproportionately on women-parental leave and childcare, for example." However, they have been less interested in winning social policies to support women where we meet our family responsibilities: in the home. In the absence of widespread feminist attention to the social value of the childraising and home management work mothers do, poor mothers' right to do motherwork has been only faintly defended. The popular feminist claim that women earn independence, autonomy, and equality through wages historically has divided feminists along class and race lines, as women of color and poor white women have not usually earned equality from sweated labor. To the contrary. Especially for women of color, wage work has been a mark of inequality: expected by the white society for whom they work; necessary because their male kin cannot find jobs or cannot earn family-supporting wages; and exploitative because their earnings keep them poor. Thus, the right to care for their own children-to work inside the home-has been a touchstone goal of their struggles for equality. The fact that women are positioned divergently in the nexus among caregiving, wage earning, and inequality separated fem- inists one from another on the welfare issue and separated em- ployed middle-class feminists from mothers who need welfare. Out of the middle-class feminist emphasis on winning rights in the workplace has emerged, sotto voce, an expectation that women ought to work outside the home and an assumption that any job outside the home-including caring for other peo- ple's children-is more socially productive than caring for one's own. Feminists in Congress betrayed this bias, voting unfazed to require poor single mothers to work outside the home both as a condition of welfare and as a consequence of time limits. Although feminism is fundamentally about winning women choices, our labor market bias has put much of feminism not on the side of vocational choice-the choice to work inside or out- side the home-but on the side of wage earning for all women. Thus, most congressional feminists, along with many feminists across the country, have conflated their right to work outside the home with poor single mothers' obligation to do so. This is an obligation of no small significance for poor single mothers, who are conscripted into wagework under the new welfare law. Most single mothers work outside the home, and most single mothers who receive welfare want to. The question is whether social policy should dictate that they must. Poor single mothers already shoulder a double burden in parenting: should social policy require them to perform yet another job? Except for a few young men in my classes who insist that mothering is love, not work, I think most people understand that the caregiving mostly provided by mothers is work. Dis- agreements arise over whether that work is worth anything if it is performed for one's own family. Or, more accurately, dis- agreements arise over when that work is worth something and in what kinds of families. When Republicans and Democrats have wanted to, they have acknowledged mothers' caregiving work in public policy: they've even remunerated it. The very week it negated the motherwork of poor single women by giving final approval to the Personal Responsibility Act, Congress affirmed the mother- work of middle-class homemakers by granting them rights to their own IRAs. 12 Representative Nancy Johnson hailed the measure as forwarding equality for homemakers. Others hailed it for honoring them. Viewed alongside welfare reform, IRAs for homemakers deepened existing differentiations in law between married and unmarried mothers, between white women and women of color, and between rich women and poor. It also cre- ated a distinction between poor single mothers' activities in the home and married, middle-class mothers' work there. IRAs, after all, are an untaxed portion of earned income. Clearly, legislators do understand that what (some) domes- tic mothers do is not pass the time but work. The challenge, then, is to lead policymakers to give poor mothers' caregiving work the dignity it is due by providing it an income. Payments for mothers' caregiving work ought not to be too difficult to calculate, for much of the work done by caregiving mothers al- ready has a market price if performed for someone else's fami- ly. We pay teachers, for example, as well as psychologists, nurses, accountants, chauffeurs, launderers, housecleaners, cooks, waitresses, even personal shoppers.'3 To some extent we can derive a right to a caregiver's income through constitutional reasoning: a socially provided income guarantee ought to be a condition of reproductive, marital, fam- ily, and vocational freedoms-as well as a matter of equal protec- tion. Although the Constitution does not oblige us to provide for one another's economic security, it does permit us to imagine different ways to enforce its meaning legislatively: the Four- teenth Amendment gives Congress the responsibility to enact laws that enforce its provisions, including its clause promising "equal protection of the law." Moreover, the Constitution per- mits us to defend rights with remedies, including remedial so- cial supports-legal assistance for poor criminal defendants, for example-without which the rights of some citizens would dis- appear. Welfare remedies poor single mothers' inequality, specifically This content downloaded from 128.83.206.210 on Wed, 29 Jul 2015 01:35:52 UTC All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Gwendolyn Mink 63 the inequality of economic disfranchisement. Mothers' economic disfranchisement comes from our failure to impute economic value to the work that they do. In marriages, mothers who work inside the home surrender their economic personhood to husbands and occupy the legal status of dependent. Such mar- ried mothers' lack of their own economic resources-earnings- skew power relations in the family; some mothers may feel tethered to husbands because they could not survive the eco- nomic consequences of leaving them. Single mothers, mean- while, must accept destitution as a condition of caring for their children. Unpaid and disdained, they are expected to forswear childraising for full-time wage earning. Full-time caregiving mothers, then, are disproportionately dependent on men if mar- ried and disproportionately poor, if not. These private inequali- ties have public effects, foreclosing mother-workers' indepen- dent citizenship. We would begin to redress these inequalities by providing caregivers who are parenting alone an income in recognition of their family work. A socially provided income for solo parents who bear the dual responsibilities of providing care for their children and financing it, welfare is a condition of equality in the family, in the labor market, and in the state. As such, wel- fare should be a right, not an entitlement-a claim backed by law and courts that should be irresistible, or at least impossi- ble for a rogue Congress to deny. Unless we can establish a right to welfare, we cannot cure inequality where it is most gendered-in sexual, reproductive, and family relations. A right to income support in return for poor single mothers' caregiving work tackles the neglected side of the gender divide, the side that has defined women as the legal and economic de- pendents of men. But although a caregiver's income would ad- dress the gender divide, it need not reproduce that divide. Rights that accommodate mothers' caregiving work need not ascribe motherwork to all women, nor only to women: men can mother, too. Nor need rights that accommodate mothers' care- giving work disparage women's choices and equality claims in the labor market. Such rights should widen options for solo caregivers of either gender by backing up the choice to work outside the home with the means not to. Ending welfare by re- defining it in this way will enable equality-in the safety net, be- tween the genders, among women, and under the Constitution.
Written between her staff on the topic of paid speeches given to HWA amidst the 2016 United States’ presidential election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton earned scrutiny from those across the political spectrum with a leaked electronic message (Carrk, 2016). In this message, her staff had discussed over specifically on the topics of financial reform, national security, and finally, one topic that firmly secured the opposition of many Republican voters: “open borders”. Amongst the more conspiratorial right-wing crowd, Clinton’s dream of a “hemispheric common market, with open borders and open trade”, had further cemented a perception of a vast elitist network that reaches up as high as Hungarian-American business magnate George Soros, seeking to undermine American values and institutions. Humorous commentary aside, while everyone who supports the “open borders” ideal is not a Marxist internationalist nor a market fundamentalist entirely unsympathetic to national sovereignty, not everyone who opposes it is a militant nativist nor supports the vaguely anti-Semitic accusation that “international bankers” are the leaders of this grand conspiracy to doom the States into a third-world nation. Back to the subject, be it by de juro or de facto, “open borders” position is not exactly an elimination of borders as the geographic boundaries of a nation-state but the substantive reduction of movement-related barriers such as entry status, entry duration, entry qualifications, or entry quotes. For example, while the borders between Ireland and the United Kingdom may be considered conditionally open borders based on the sole requirement of nationality identification, the borders between the United States and the United Mexican States would immediately fall under the classification of controlled borders with restrictions on foreign-born migrants’ use of private and public resources, an extensive visa and quota system, and their subsequent enforcement. But given the parameters of literature, there’s to discuss more about open borders between neighboring countries rather than a general open borders and such will be this article. Fiscal and economic costs & benefits There is inadequate amount of literature on the subject of open borders with the exception of a few studies on migration economics, pitching for less restrictive immigration policy. In the Journal of Economic Perspectives, Michael A. Clemens postulates that based on estimates and his subsequent assumptions such as the shape of labor demand, looser immigration policies appear to create “trillion-dollar bills on the sidewalk” where the gains of barriers elimination would produce “large fractions of world GDP”. Simply put, there should be a greater research priority to the confirmation of these barriers as “one of the fattest of all wedges between humankind’s current welfare and its potential welfare” (Clemens, 2011). The reasons could be easily summed up: not only would this benefit the host nation with lower cost of labor, both unskilled and skilled, but the parent country would receive remittances as a second-order effect or later receive better skilled, trained workers that would beneficial for its human capital development. However, as one of many metrics for the monetary value of a country’s output, GDP is not a sole indicator of economic or societal health. Concerns of natives’ wage suppression — that immigration labor may present itself as substitute and thus lower the value of labor — are valid. The commonly remarked study of David Card on the Impact of the Mariel Boatlift on the Miami Labor Market, analyzes the matters of the depression in the labor market opportunities of low-skilled workers. His study demonstrated that the “influx of Mariel immigrants had virtually no effect on the wage rates of less-skilled non-Cuban workers” in Miami, alleviating some concerns about whether immigration could place a burden on society as a whole (David, 1990). However, commentators immediately made their case against the study by noting that it did not suggest a genuine comparison. In fact, Marielitos’ education was generally below high school equivalency whereas the unskilled natives in the study included but were not limited to similar demographics, as argued by George J. Borjas of Harvard University. Moreover, the Marie1 immigration can be ascribed to a distinct “long-run pattern” with subsequent positive impact on the survivability of the observed wage structure in the article (ibid). The unpleasant reality is that immigration presents economic winners and losers, with considerable losses for substitutable native labor in competition with immigration labor and taxpayers who pay taxes to “support means-tested benefit programs” (Wolla, 2014). That being said, labor is heterogeneous; immigration labor is not limited to substitution but may provide complementary labor; that labor may “increase job opportunities and wages for native-born workers” by decreasing production costs, increasing production output, and subsequently increasing the demand of native-born laborers in joint industries (ibid). However, fiscal drain has been a raised point by traditional and libertarian conservatives alike where the United States’ generous welfare system may attract low-skilled laborer at masse; a problematic situation as the welfare state may be forced to accommodate a now larger pool of individuals who are likelier to use benefits and contribute less (or perhaps collapse under this tonnage). Unsurprisingly, under the Clinton administration, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act had effectively targeted concerns of non-citizens’ access to welfare benefits by stalling a non-citizen’s eligibility for federal welfare funds for five years but expanding their access into the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TNAF). However, without this mention, there are still other welfare benefits such as a non-citizen’s possible use of public resources in medical emergencies and their children’s subsequent entrance into education. This presents an immediate concern for those who still consider the present welfare state necessary, if not inadequate. Social capital and cultural lines Economic successes and losses may be left to the economists and to their future research. Nevertheless, concerned moralists and philosophers may consider, “What is to be of the society? Our nation-state? Our cultures?” Generally speaking, the “open borders” platform better spawns economic cosmopolitanism as opposed to cultural cosmopolitanism because of the manner it reduces nation-states into “an aggregate of individuals pursuing their material benefit” (Kleingeld, 1999); that instead of an emphasis on “global cultural pluralism”, the endorsement of “perpetual mobility” brought by this immigration policy “would uproot communities and destroy their traditional ways”, creating a “global potpourri of cultural forms” (ibid). This present-day neoliberalism alongside 21st century globalization presents unstability to the manner national identity may be manufactured such as the redefinition of the American identity as to “exclude the groups who are deemed to be illegitimate competitors and usurpers” (Momen, 2017). One may observe these symbolic boundaries in the recent rise of nationalistic jargon; that in a sense, Americans feel as if they’re “strangers in their own land”, as observed by Berkeley anthropologist Arlie Russell Hochschild in her ethnographic study of American Tea Party members. It is no surprise that an open borders policy may further challenge notions of citizenship, national identity, and culture, these moralists may say. Unsurprisingly, polls have routinely found that “Americans display the highest degree of national pride among Western nation” but does American civil nationalism and volunteerism solely embodies the spirit of the American identity as Minxin Pei writes (Pei, 2003)? One could claim that while American has always championed openness to foreigners as a whole, it has flirted with nativism as early as the late 1790’s Alien and Sedition Acts and as recently as President Donald Trump’s “America First” rhetoric. However, whereas Italians would not be disparaged as an illegitimate competitor and usurper today, Italian immigrants had faced a claustrophobic indoor existence amidst unhealthy working conditions in late 19th century and early 20th century, not uncommon to the American immigrant experience. Notably, the anti-immigration discourse has adapted based on this trend of globalization; that in addition to the unassailability being due to cultural grounds, there is an additional fear that immigrants are of “multiple national affiliations” rather than confined to one American identity (Momen, 2017). Regrettably, American Robert Putman and his work on diversity paints a bleak image; that on the short-term, there’s a “tradeoff between diversity and community” where the former may “challenge social solidarity and inhibit social capital” (Putnam, 2007). However, these social arrangements are not terminal. Puterman himself emphasizes the short-term nature of this relationship between diversity and social capital; that shortening of social distance is the long-term solution to mitigating an identity crisis. Rather than forsaking diversity as a whole, communal solidarity, English-language training, and national aid to affected localities may be the appropriate instruments as to social engineer a new shared sense of citizenship — one that may better accommodate economic successes and social capital (ibid). Of which, the matters are still in question but it is still rather unwise to underestimate the ethnic boundaries and their attributed meanings in the construction of national identity. Furthermore, this may be an American problem rather than an issue integral to the human condition; the negative impact of social trust may have more in relation with “stronger ethnic residential segregation” than diversity itself (Bloemraad, 2010) or that perhaps, a less equitable government may be responsible for the offset of multiculturalism when factors are accounted (You, 2005). There may be nuance to this subject rather than this pessimistic dismissal of a multicultural society and all of its possibilities; that the direction and strength of the relationship between diversity and social trusts may depend on institutional and policy context rather than universally (Kesler et al, 2010). Conclusions While open borders may not be possible in terms of realpolitik or an appropriate policy out of national security concerns, the policy does reconsider ethical and moral frameworks present in contemporary United States and other Western nations, packaging a seductive idea with many arguments and keyhole solutions to popular criticism. It thus warrants mainstream discussion beyond empty platitudes about nation-state and sovereignty. I draw back to Michael A. Clemens’s claim; that greater research priority to the position may be “one of the fattest of all wedges between humankind’s current welfare and its potential welfare” (Clemens, 2011). I cannot claim that open borders is a universal ideal for all countries, that the policy is a panacea for all ills, or that it would consequently do no wrong but that discussions — as any other sensitive issue — may be treated as if its merits means the entire well-being and ethical backbone of our nations.
ISIS may already be thinking of using Ebola as a low-tech weapon of bio-terror, says a national security expert, who notes that the “Islamic State of Iraq and Syria” and terror groups like it wouldn’t even have to weaponize the virus to attempt to wreak strategic global infection. Such groups could simply use human carriers to intentionally infect themselves in West Africa, then disseminate the deadly virus via the world’s air transportation system. Or so says Capt. Al Shimkus, Ret., a Professor of National Security Affairs at the U.S. Naval War College. “The individual exposed to the Ebola Virus would be the carrier,” Shimkus told Forbes. “In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn’t take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.” And with a significant portion of West Africa now in an open epidemic, it arguably wouldn’t be difficult for a terrorist group to simply waltz in and make off with some infected bodily fluids for use elsewhere at another time. They wouldn’t even have to “isolate” it, says Shimkus, who teaches a course in chemical and biological warfare. He says that if ISIS wanted to send half a dozen of its operatives into an Ebola outbreak region and intentionally expose themselves to the virus, they very well could. The idea is then once they had intentionally infected themselves, they would try to interact with as many people in their target city or country of choice. The average fatality rate from Ebola, classified as a hemorrhagic fever, is 50 percent; but without medical treatment, that figure can range as high as 90 percent, reports the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO also notes that although there are two potential vaccines undergoing “evaluation,” at present none are licensed. The virus was first documented in humans in 1976 during two simultaneous outbreaks, one in Sudan and the other in the Congo, in a village near the Ebola River. The WHO reports that a type of fruit bat is thought to act as the virus’ natural host. The virus apparently spreads into the human population via direct contact with infected animals — ranging from chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines; as well as the fruit bat itself — be they found ill or dead in the rain forest. According to the WHO, Ebola can then be spread via contact with the infected’s bodily fluids; even bedding and clothing “contaminated” with such fluids. The idea of using human carriers to intentionally spread deadly pathogens has been around for centuries. As Shimkus points out, in the Middle Ages, adversaries threw infected corpses over their enemy’s city walls in order to spread the deadly Bubonic Plague.
The world has achieved unprecedented peace, prosperity, and inter-dependence, but past achievements — and further progress — are threatened by a host of looming challenges. Global institutions that served us well and transformed the world are becoming victims of their own success and must be reformed or replaced to deal with new challenges and take advantage of new opportunities. Governments everywhere face rising expectations and increasing demands but find themselves less able to manage the challenges they face. The next round of challenges can only be managed successfully if nations, especially major powers, cooperate. Moreover, the most difficult and most consequential challenges cannot be managed effectively without sustained cooperation between the largest developing country, China, and the largest developed country, the United States. Stated another way, the ability of China and the United States to work together on critical global challenges will determine whether the world is able to sustain and enhance mutually beneficial developments or fails to cope with the issues critical to the global future and to the security and prosperity of the United States and China. This shared conviction persuades us that we must do more than just hope that our countries will find ways to cooperate. This report represents a joint effort to develop both the rationale and concrete mechanisms for sustained, proactive collaboration to address challenges resulting from long-term global trends and consequential uncertainties. It builds on the findings of independent efforts to identify megatrends and potential game-changers with the goal of developing a framework for the US-China relationship that will better enable us to meet the challenges facing the global community and the strategic needs of both countries. The Joint Working Group recognizes that China and the United States hold different views on many bilateral and international issues, and that our relationship is constrained by mutual suspicion and strategic mistrust. Nevertheless, our common strategic interests and responsibility as major powers are more important than the specific issues that divide us; we must not make cooperation on critical global issues contingent on prior resolution of bilateral disputes. Our disagreements on bilateral issues are important, but they are not as important to our long-term security and prosperity as is our ability to cooperate on key challenges to global security and our increasingly intertwined futures. We must cooperate on global challenges not as a favor to one another or because other nations expect us to exercise leadership in the international system. We must do it because failure to cooperate on key global challenges will have profoundly negative consequences for the citizens of our own countries. The Joint Working Group has no illusions about how difficult the task ahead will be. Leaders in both countries face relentless domestic pressures to focus on near-term issues, often to the detriment of long-term interests, as well as on looming US-China bilateral differences and mutual suspicions. This report seeks to illustrate why it is imperative and how it is possible to pursue long- and short-term interests at the same time. How We Reached Key Assessments and Recommendations Generous support from the China-United States Exchange Foundation enabled the Atlantic Council and the China Institute of International Studies (CIIS) to establish a Joint Working Group of experts from both countries. The members of the group met in Beijing and Washington in the spring and summer of 2012 to compare and integrate the findings of separate Chinese and US draft reports on global trends. The Chinese projection of trends, entitled Global Trends to 2030 and the Prospects for China-US Relations, was prepared by CIIS with contributions from the School of International Studies at Peking University. The US report, Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds, was prepared by the US National Intelligence Council (NIC).[1] The Atlantic Council contributed to the NIC report and members of the NIC team attended (as observers) the joint assessment meetings. This review confirmed that the independently developed reports were generally consistent in their assessments of global trends and provided a solid basis for development of scenarios to illustrate what might happen under different assumptions about cooperation between China and the United States. The scenarios in both analyses depict markedly different outcomes for China, the United States, and the world. When China and the United States cooperate to meet looming challenges, both countries benefit. When they fail to cooperate and pursue narrow interests or win-lose or zero-sum outcomes, both countries lose. Continuing down the path of drift and episodic cooperation that we are on now also leads to lose-lose outcomes. The obvious advantages of win-win outcomes and dangerous implications of behaviors that eschew or minimize cooperation create strong incentives to focus on megatrends, critical challenges, and enhancing the likelihood of success and mutual benefit through close and continuous collaboration. This report outlines the case for collaboration and makes several specific recommendations to make cooperation both possible and fruitful. It was drafted and circulated among group members for revisions and to ensure consensus. China and the United States have different interests, objectives, and perspectives on many matters, and the number of issues in dispute may well grow as we broaden our bilateral relationship and at times disagree with one another on the world stage. Resolving some of these issues will be difficult and require much time and effort. The resolution of these contentious issues in the US-China relationship, however, must not be made a prerequisite for cooperation on a limited but arguably more important set of issues with the clear potential to harm both of our interests. Continued drift toward strategic competition and failure to find a balance of interests on core issues will undermine support in both countries for cooperation on major global issues of mutual interest and benefit. Cooperation on shared global challenges may build trust and make it easier to resolve nettlesome bilateral issues. But that would be an ancillary benefit and should not be the primary reason for collaboration on the global challenges identified in the independently prepared studies and summarized elsewhere in this report. The primary reasons we need to work together on the global challenges are that they cannot be addressed successfully unless we do, and that failure to deal effectively with consequential megatrends will have deleterious consequences for China, the United States, and the world. It is difficult to envision a stable, prosperous global system absent a US-China relationship that is largely a cooperative one. Forces and megatrends that are visible but not well understood today will shape the futures of people everywhere. The list include(s) consequences of globalization that increase prosperity but also increase demand for water, food, and energy. It also includes demographic change and effects of climate change that will intensify the consequences of other megatrends and make them more difficult to manage. Some of the megatrends and the way they interact will threaten social and political stability unless managed effectively. All have profound implications for governance and global stability. How effectively governments meet and manage these challenges in the next ten to twenty years will determine how beneficial or detrimental they will be for our countries and our children. Successfully navigating the turbulent waters ahead will require understanding the challenges we face and foresight about the implications of alternative paths. Our common goal must be to avert or ameliorate negative outcomes, and to maximize the chances of achieving desirable outcomes. To accomplish this goal, China and the United States must establish and draw on a continuing dialogue on the evolution, implications, and possible policy responses to the most consequential megatrends, key uncertainties, and disruptive change. The framework and policy recommendations of this report seek to jumpstart that process by suggesting mechanisms for collaboration that begin bilaterally but eventually include other nations critical to finding paths to a better future for all. I. Critical Importance of China-US Cooperation The global future is likely to be increasingly volatile and uncertain. The rate of change is increasing, driven by the accelerating pace of technological development, unprecedented urbanization and growth of the global middle class, and a wide range of challenges beyond the control of any one country but potentially affecting the prosperity and security of all countries. Disruptive change in one geographic or functional area will spread quickly.. No country, and certainly not those with the largest populations and largest economies, will be immune. Global challenges like climate change, food and water shortages, and resource scarcities will shape the strategic context for all nations and require reconsideration of traditional national concerns such as sovereignty and maximizing the ability of national leaders to control their country’s destiny. What China and the United States do, individually and together, will have a major impact on the future of the global system. As importantly, our individual fates will be inextricably linked to how that future plays out. The three illustrative scenarios sketched out below underscore how critical the future of the US-China relationship is to each country and to the world. • Global Drift and Erosion (the present world trajectory): In a world in which nations fail to resolve global problems and strengthen mechanisms of global cooperation, governments gradually turn inward. Each nation seeks to protect and advance its own narrow national interests or to preserve an unsustainable status quo that is rapidly changing in ways that erode the international order. The international community’s lack of ability to cooperate to meet global challenges leads to international crises and instability. • Zero-Sum World: Unsustainable drift leads to a world of predominantly zero-sum competition and conflict in the face of severe resource constraints. The result is economic crises and internal instability as well as interstate confrontation. There is risk of military conflict between major powers, which increases global mistrust and uncertainty and fosters an “each nation for itself” mentality that further undermines the ability of states to cooperate in the face of growing common challenges. • Global Revitalization and Cooperation: To escape the perils of drift or zero-sum competition, leaders in countries with the most to lose work together to manage and take advantage of global challenges and megatrends. Cooperation makes it possible to achieve win-win outcomes that avoid or mitigate negative consequences of increased demand for resources and the impact of climate change as well as to harness new technologies to improve living conditions through sustainable development. Cooperation creates and utilizes new transnational institutions to prevent conflict and enhance security for all. China and the United States become more prosperous as we work together. The possible futures sketched out above (and developed at greater length below) are intended to stimulate thinking about how current trends and uncertainties could lead to very different global and national outcomes. For many reasons, the United States and China will have greater ability and incentives than other countries to cooperate in determining and shaping developments over the next two decades. Indeed, it is very difficult to imagine a pathway to “global revitalization and cooperation” in which China and the United States do not cooperate and provide critical international leadership. Many factors will shape the future, some of which are beyond the control of any nation state, but China and the United States — and the character of the US-China relationship — will be critical. The mutual dependence on each other’s economic performance and the success of the global economy as a whole was demonstrated during the 2008 financial crisis that began in the United States but quickly spread around the world. US and Chinese leaders recognized that they were in the “same boat” strategically and engaged in a closely coordinated response to the crisis, which played a key—if not decisive—role in preventing the situation from becoming much worse. The need for joint and coordinated responses to economic crises and to mounting economic challenges and threats is certain to increase as globalization continues and interdependence deepens. II. Critical Megatrends There are many global trends that are positive, including greater prosperity; global economic reconvergence after two centuries of Western economic preponderance; profound social changes driven by rapid scientific and technological changes; a growing global middle class; widespread improvement in global health and life expectancy; and overall reduction in war and violent deaths. The great advances in human prosperity over the last several decades and the potential for greater gains in the future are to be celebrated, but they also create new challenges shaped by megatrends in the “global operating environment”. These megatrends include: • Individual empowerment is an increasingly important factor both within states and internationally. The empowerment of individuals is fueled by education, rising prosperity, and a host of technologies. Empowered individuals, the growing middle class, and domestic NGOs are more willing to engage in political activities as well as to make more demands on government. The sense of national identity is becoming stronger in many places but so too are social identities based on ethnicity, religion, culture, political concerns, and shared causes such as the environment and public health. This trend sometimes also fuels extremism and separatism. • Power will be increasingly diffused as the number of players with actual or nascent capacity to influence international deve-lopments is increasing. The international system evinces increasing signs of fragmentation and stratification. In addition to the rise of China, India, and Brazil, middle powers such as Turkey, Indonesia, South Africa, and Mexico are playing an ever more important role in the international arena. Further, the growing numbers and types of non-state actors such as international NGOs, multinational enterprises, and regional organizations mean states themselves no longer control the system. • Aging and urbanizing populations, accompanied by waves of domestic and international migration, will transform societies and strain capabilities. More than one billion people will be added to the global population by 2030 and an equal or greater number will move to cities. Rising incomes will enable as many as two billion more people to join the global middle class. Nearly all of the growth in the global population, urban dwellers, and the middle class will occur in developing countries. Critical demographic shifts will age populations and shrink the percentage of working-age cohorts in most of the developed and, increasingly, in parts of the developing world as well. China will be one of the developing countries with an aging population. Waves of immigration will create or exacerbate significant social problems, but there also will be a huge international marketplace for skilled and talented workers. • There will be increasing stresses and strains on the global commons. Many challenges to the environment and human security will be intensified by rapidly increased food, water, and natural resource consumption due to growing population, urbanization, and rapid expansion of the middle class. If not managed well, these challenges could have a significant and long-term adverse impact on all nations and the global system. • There is increasing concern that global climate change poses an existential threat to humanity. Climate change exacerbates water shortages and food production challenges; sparks greater migration and social conflict; acidifies the oceans; and leads to more extreme weather events, including sea-level rises magnifying the impact of storm surges threatening coastal cities and infrastructure. There is likely to be more focus by the international community on climate change consequence management, adaptation, and mitigation. III. Key Uncertainties The megatrends summarized above constitute a relatively predictable set of challenges facing individuals and nations, especially China and the United States. But they are not the only factors that will influence developments in the next two decades. The relatively predictable megatrends will interact with a number of critical uncertainties. Examples include: • The future of the global economy is volatile. The developed countries, especially in the Eurozone, may face a prolonged period of recovery. The developing countries, including China and India, face a “middle income trap”. The world could experience growing economic nationalism and trade protectionism as well as an accelerating adjustment of international industrial division of labor as China refocuses on domestic consumption-led growth, other nations increasingly displace China as the low-cost provider, and new manufacturing technologies and lower energy costs encourage the return of manufacturing to the United States and other developed countries. In addition, major economic crises could result from the increasing pressure on resource availability discussed previously. • The accelerating pace of technological development is likely to change the global operating environment for foreign policy and national security over the next two decades with uncertain consequences. A wide range of emerging technologies will affect the political, social, economic and security trajectories of states, international relations, and the international system, as have the Internet, mobile communications technology, and social media. These technologies range from new energy systems and manufacturing technologies such as 3D printing to bio- and nanotechnology breakthroughs affecting agricultural productivity, human enhancement, robotics, and information availability. On the negative side of the ledger, cyber hacking, cyber warfare, and genomics-enabled bioterrorism have the potential to be highly disruptive. • Nationalistic responses to increasing mutual vulnerability are likely as growing global interconnectedness and interdependence ensure that developments anywhere in the world, from slowly-developing threats like climate change to short-term crises like the 2008 financial crisis, can affect most nations and citizens yet be largely, if not completely, outside the control of individual states. National responses to common challenges and threats could be “each nation for itself” actions to achieve narrow national interests at the expense of other states and the common good. • Unpredictable events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemics, or nuclear weapon use by terrorists could be game-changers. An H5N1 or similar pandemic could shut down global transportation and kill tens of millions or more with a huge impact on the global economy, politics, and security. A series of extreme weather events, foreshadowed by Hurricane Sandy’s impact on the United States, could change the trajectories of global political efforts to deal with the consequences of climate change. • The future of both China and the United States is uncertain. China has many internal challenges that could limit its willingness to be a “joint responsible stakeholder” with the United States to meet global challenges and resolve regional conflicts. Similarly, the United States faces major economic challenges that could lead to long-term slow growth, a more inward focus, and a less active and influential role in catalyzing cooperation on global challenges. Conversely, one or both countries could achieve considerable success in its/their domestic arena(s) and feel emboldened to lead the transformation of the global system. • Conflicts could become more common and more intense as a result of social unrest, religious extremism, reduced provision of public goods, power shifts, and individual empowerment. The world’s security and stability may become increasingly fragile as a result of state failure, nuclear proliferation, or dramatic acts of terrorism, especially in unstable regions like the Middle East and South Asia. • Regional instability may have global impact. A major conflict in the Middle East, including over Iran’s nuclear weapons, could draw in outside powers, disrupt oil supplies, and send the global economy into recession. Failure to resolve or indefinitely shelve territorial disputes in East and Southeast Asia could limit the ability of regional states to cooperate in global as well as regional efforts to cope with global challenges. Military conflict over these disputes also could destabilize the Asia-Pacific region with grave consequences for the global economy and international stability. An existential crisis of the European Union could disrupt the cohesiveness of what is now the world’s largest economy. IV. Governance and Cooperation Challenges of Megatrends and Uncertainties Although no one can predict with confidence exactly how events will play out in the years ahead, we can be confident that the challenges and choices facing decision-makers at all levels and in all countries will be shaped by the interplay of megatrends, known uncertainties, unexpected “black swan” events, and the decisions of governments and nongovernmental actors. Waiting to see how events unfold is a possible but undesirable choice because waiting is, in effect, a decision to do nothing and hope for the best. We can and must do better than that by working to shape events in ways that reduce uncertainty, avoid or ameliorate undesirable trajectories, and increase the likelihood of win-win outcomes. Some of the challenges posed include: • Volatile global economy: Slower economic growth and potential crises such as a Eurozone meltdown, another global financial crisis, or a sustained spike in food prices could slow or reverse progress toward greater prosperity and better lives for more people. Growing inequality (worsening GINI coefficients[2]) could further compound the challenges. Although the rich and the poor alike may become richer, the absolute gaps between them likely will widen, both within and among countries and regions. Moreover, the middle class may continue to be squeezed not only in developed countries but also in developing countries despite more rapid economic growth, especially as the gap widens between the middle class and the super rich. • Increasing internal pressures on governments: Demands on governments at all levels likely will increase faster than the availability of resources required to satisfy them. More people with rising expectations and greater awareness of conditions at home and elsewhere will have more tools, especially social media, to organize and put pressure on governments to provide more services and opportunities. The rising middle class in the emerging economies likely will expect and demand more and better quality food and water, more reliable supplies of cleaner energy, improved infrastructure, and healthier environments. Governments could find it difficult to meet rising expectations, however, especially growing demand for increasingly limited resources, which will push prices upward and exacerbate economic and social instability. At the same time, some of the poorest countries with ineffective governments may be pushed into internal conflict and state failure by tribal, ethnic, and religious strife as well as economic and environmental stresses. These internal conflicts could lead to regional instability as environmental and economic migrants spill into neighboring states. Global cooperation gap widening: Increasing globalization and interdependence could make it more difficult for national govern-ments to manage new challenges on their own, but transnational institutions will be increasingly ill-suited or even incapable of meeting twenty-first century challenges. To meet the growing challenges, existing global mechanisms, most of which are legacy institutions from the post-World War II era designed to solve problems from the inter-war period, must be reformed or replaced. That will not be easy. There are 140 more countries today than there were when the global system was last reformed in the 1940s and all feel entitled to a seat at the table when decisions are made that will affect their own destinies. This widely shared ethos of democratic participation of all nations makes it difficult to strike a balance between equity of representation and efficacy of decision-making. • Domestic pressures and weak national governments: Gov-ernments may become less willing or able to cooperate with other nations as a result of domestic pressures on leaders to pursue narrow national interests. This will increase the likelihood of nations engaging in zero-sum behavior that will make it even more difficult to deal with the most challenging megatrends. • Extremism and fracturing of the nation-state: Extremism and separatism are likely to be fueled by individual empowerment and tribal, ethnic, religious, and other identities, strengthened by ubiquitous social media. The power and authority of the nation-state is likely to be increasingly circumscribed by the rising power of non-state actors and the growing importance of transnational challenges beyond the state’s control. The state is being challenged in many cases by separatist and extremist forces, including religious fundamentalists in Waziristan and Dagestan and regional nationalists in Catalonia and Scotland. • “Black swans” and lack of robust international institutions: Failure to establish robust international institutions and habits of cooperation could reduce the international community’s ability to respond to major crises, including black swan events. The latter are high impact but either improbable or simply unpredictable calamities such as pandemics, nuclear weapon or biological warfare attacks, or cyber meltdowns. If China and the United States act as rivals and give priority to parochial interests, it may be impossible for the international community to successfully confront the major challenges of the next twenty years. Owing to their size and importance in the global system, what China and the US do together as well as individually will profoundly affect the international community’s ability to engage in robust international cooperation in science and technology to find solutions to the world’s most pressing problems. V. Scenarios Illustrate Interconnections and Alternative Outcomes As the megatrends and uncertainties evolve over the coming two decades and beyond, China and the United States, along with the rest of the world, will face unprecedented challenges and unpredictable, disruptive change. We offer three global scenarios to illustrate how the complex megatrends, key uncertainties, and disruptive changes could play out, depending in large part on whether the relationship between China and the United States is primarily cooperative or conflictual. • Global Drift and Erosion: This scenario is characterized by the inability of China and the United States to work together effectively, if at all, to address key global challenges and to resolve regional conflicts. Problems created or exacerbated by the megatrends, key uncertainties, and their interactions worsen, creating a world that is less peaceful, less stable, and less prosperous. The debacle of the 2009 Copenhagen UN climate change conference demonstrated the global impact of the failure of the United States and China to agree on far-reaching steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this future, the US and China again fail to respond adequately to continuing problems such as economic imbalances associated with the efforts of many countries to break into and then move from middle income status to that of high income. There is disruptive socio-political change related in part to both economic and demographic transitions, and environmental problems involving inadequate energy, water, and food resources. Washington and Beijing could be too preoccupied with political and military competition and territorial disputes in the Western Pacific, as well as by bilateral differences over intellectual property and other trade issues, to tackle these pressing problems. Among possible developments, US-China tensions could adversely affect global responses to energy challenges. These range from threats to security of supplies resulting from conflict in the Middle East and Persian Gulf to the need for a global energy transition away from fossil fuels to minimize carbon emissions and the impact of energy price volatility on global economic growth. Further, China and the United States also could fail to cooperate in efforts to mitigate the potentially disruptive impact of greatly increased demand for food, water, and other resources created by the addition of more than one billion people to the global population by 2030 as well as possibly two billion or more people to the developing world middle class. Without adequate international cooperation and global governmental mechanisms, this could lead to deeper economic crises, unresolved political conflicts, and worsening environmental conditions. • Zero-Sum World: A second possible trajectory could lead to the emergence of an even more competitive and dangerous zero-sum world, in which nations pursue narrow national interests. For example, the world could experience intense monetary and trade protectionism, with countries seeking geopolitical advantage at the expense of international cooperation for the common good. It could see intensifying rivalries, creating hostilities and rendering cooperation on global challenges nearly impossible as global governmental mechanisms break down or are marginalized.
One problem with fusion centers is that they exist in a no-man’s land between the feder- al government and the states, where policy and oversight is often uncertain and open to manipulation. There appears to be at least some conscious effort to circumvent public oversight by obscuring who is really in charge of these fusion centers and what laws apply to them. In struggling to answer the seemingly simple question of who is in charge of fusion centers at a recent congressional hearing, a Department of Homeland Security official could only offer that “fusion centers are in charge of fusion centers.”16 One ana- lyst reportedly described his fusion center as the “wild west,” where officials were free to “use a variety of technologies before ‘politics’ catches up and limits options.”17 Federal involvement in the centers continues to grow. Most fusion centers developed as an extension of existing law enforcement intelligence units and as a result they have sometimes been described as “state police intelligence units on steroids.”18 But exactly who is providing those steroids is key to determining who will control them in the future. Fusion centers are still primarily staffed and funded by state authorities, but: The federal government is playing an essential role in the development and net- working of fusion centers by providing financial assistance, sponsoring security clearances, and providing personnel, guidance and training.19 The FBI has over 200 agents and analysts assigned to 36 fusion centers and plans to increase this commitment in the future.20 As of December 2006, the DHS alone has provided over $380 million in federal funds to support fusion centers.21 At least one fusion center, the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center (MCAC), was initiated and led by federal authorities and was only recently turned over to the control of state officials. Thirty percent of ostensibly state-controlled fusion centers are physically located within federal agency workspace.22 Federal authorities are happy to reap the benefits of working with the fusion centers without officially taking ownership. Fusion center supporters argue that the federal gov- ernment can use the “800,000 plus law enforcement officers across the country” to “function as the ‘eyes and ears’ of an extended national security community.”23 Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff, while denying that the federal government had any intention of controlling fusion centers, declared that “what we want to do is not create a single [fusion center], but a network of [centers] all across the country.”24
It is therefore appropriate to move beyond explanation and to turn to possibilities for reform—to consider steps that might be taken to prevent the entire structure from falling to earth. The first set of potential remedies aspires to tone up Madisonian muscles one by one with ad hoc legislative and judicial reforms, by, say, narrowing the scope of the state secrets privilege; permitting the recipients of national security letters at least to make their receipt public; broadening standing requirements; improving congressional oversight of covert operations, including drone killings and cyber operations; or strengthening statutory constraints like FISA 545 and the War Powers Resolution.546 Law reviews brim with such proposals. But their stopgap approach has been tried repeatedly since the Trumanite network’s emergence. Its futility is now glaring. Why such efforts would be any more fruitful in the future is hard to understand. The Trumanites are committed to the rule of law and their sincerity is not in doubt, but the rule of law to which they are committed is largely devoid of meaningful constraints.547 Continued focus on legalist band-aids merely buttresses the illusion that the Madisonian institutions are alive and well—and with that illusion, an entire narrative premised on the assumption that it is merely a matter of identifying a solution and looking to the Madisonian institutions to effect it. That frame deflects attention from the underlying malady. What is needed, if Bagehot’s theory is correct, is a fundamental change in the very discourse within which U.S. national security policy is made. For the question is no longer: What should the government do? The questions now are: What should be done about the government? What can be done about the government? What are the responsibilities not of the government but of the people?
Today, the scenario is different. The PLA is not prepared to fight a revolutionary war where giving up one’s life for the communist party was a matter of pride. It has not fought a battle for more than 30 years. Even the PLA’s fight against terrorism against small bands of Uighur separatists in Xinjiang does not show any special expertise. At the same time there is the PLA’s significant advancement in the areas of armaments, information supported warfare, and tri-services coordination. India’s military planners have been assessing these developments. A nuclear warfare in a limited confrontation is not in the calculations of military planning. That is a separate aspect. Despite China’s naval projection in the Indian Ocean and offer from Seychelles to open a naval base (obviously as a repayment to Chinese aid), an India-China confrontation on the high seas is a distant speculation. This, unless China perceives India’s Look East policy is conflicting seriously with China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea.
If any reminders are needed, the destroyed houses, the erosion and a beach that no longer appeals are right there in plain sight.¶ “The sea flooded all this area. It also piled up mountains of sand, so much so that they had to take it away in trucks. They say that the cyclone of 1944 was similar, and that people died in it. This last time no one was killed, because they evacuated the entire population, as usual,” said Mario, a voluble bartender in the small tourist complex, completely empty during this winter season.¶ The emergency plans put in place ahead of the hurricane season, lasting from June to November each year, prevent loss of human life or reduce it to a minimum. However, they are not so effective against economic damage.¶ Hurricanes Gustav, Ike and Paloma which lashed this Caribbean island within a three-month period in 2008, caused damages officially estimated at 10 billion dollars.¶ Related IPS Articles¶ So there is no doubt that, while prevention is a good thing, so is adaptation to the consequences of climate change, of which the rise in sea level is among the most fearsome. Yet it is a risk that families living on the coastline do not always appreciate.¶ “Yes, yes, we know that we are close to the ocean, but the water has not risen much here. Besides, we’re building our new house on higher ground,” said a woman relying on her own resources to put up her new home. “My son receives cash remittances from his father, and he helps me with the building work which we are doing a little at a time, as we are able,” she said.¶ Studies by Cuban scientists on the vulnerability of coastal ecosystems in the Caribbean region warn that the sea level will rise by 27 to 85 centimetres between 2050 and 2100, a prospect with major geographical, demographic and economic implications for island states.¶ Official estimates indicate that 2.32 percent of Cuban territory may be permanently under water by 2050. If the necessary adaptation measures are not taken, as many as 79 coastal settlements will be affected and 15 will completely disappear.¶ Coastal ecosystems occupy five percent of the total area of the island, which has 588 km of beaches. An estimated 250 km of coastline are urbanised, and 1.4 million people live in 244 settlements, 63 of them urban and 181 rural.¶ “Above all, people need to know why and what adaptation is necessary,” Gisela Alonso, head of the government’s Environment Agency, told IPS. “We are undertaking climate studies in Cuba, and we have our own evaluations and our own models to predict the impact levels we have to face.”¶ She said financial resources, knowledge, technology and a national infrastructure of both material and human resources are needed in order to combat problems that are not primarily of developing nations’ making. “How can they take climate adaptation on board, when they lack education, health and nutritional security?” she asked.¶ A study carried out in eight Caribbean island nations, published in 2010 by the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), said these countries could lose up to nine percent of annual GDP due to storms and floods, believed to result from climate change.¶ Cuba is facing “above all, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, particularly related to water circulation in the atmosphere, on land and underground, including not only tropical hurricanes but also drought, serious floods, higher temperatures and – for us as an archipelago, one of the greatest dangers – rising sea level,” Alonso said.¶ However, the expert said Cuba has “a certain advantage” because it has developed its scientific potential, with the result that for many years now it has been able to evaluate and offer alternatives for social measures “within which health issues are essential”, and for economic and environmental problems.¶ According to Alonso, the island nation has a programme on climate change that covers previous studies on hazards, vulnerability and risks, including possible impacts from rising sea levels, as well as action that should be taken by each sector.¶ The plans, as yet unpublished, include land use measures that establish how far from the coast tourism investments and new urban zones should be located; and the replanting and recovery of mangrove forests, which together with coral reefs are important natural barriers protecting the coastline. On the agricultural front there will be close monitoring of water used for irrigation.¶ “The island of Cuba rests on a layer of karst (rock dissolved by groundwater, forming interconnected caves), and sea level elevation will increase saline infiltration. Water tainted with seawater will increase soil salinity, harming agricultural production,” Alonso said.¶ From the educational and social point of view, Alonso said, the community ought to know what it is up against, because climate change added to soil degradation, water pollution, shortage of water for human consumption and other environmental problems are creating a complex global scenario.¶
More than 140 Nobel laureates led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu urged China on Wednesday to release Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, a rights activist jailed for subversion since 2009. In a letter also signed by 400,000 people from more than 130 countries, the laureates called on China’s president-in-waiting Xi Jinping to release Liu and his wife Liu Xia, who has not been charged but is being held under house arrest. The petition was being submitted to Chinese embassies and diplomatic missions in Hong Kong, New York, Paris, Berlin and London. The first step in political reform is to tolerate dissidents and cherish their value and contribution to society “This flagrant violation of the basic right to due process and free expression must be publicly and forcefully confronted by the international community,” archbishop Tutu, a fellow Peace laureate, said in the petition. In Taiwan, Wu’er Kaixi, a former leader of the 1989 Tiananmen protests and one of those who signed the petition, urged Beijing-friendly President Ma Ying-jeou to relay the appeal to Xi. “Hopefully, through the petition President Ma would do something that would help the Chinese government’s release of Liu Xiaobo and his wife,” he told reporters. Another Tiananmen protest leader, Wang Dan, who like Wu’er Kaixi lives in exile in Taiwan, also signed the document. In a previous statement commemorating the Tiananmen protests, Ma called on the Chinese government to release Liu as a step towards political reform while pressing for exchanges with the island. “The first step in political reform is to tolerate dissidents and cherish their value and contribution to society,” Ma said. Liu, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 2010, was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2009 on subversion charges after co-authoring Charter 08, a bold petition calling for political reform in his Communist-ruled homeland.
U.S. education law has developed under both the federal system and the state systems. The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly enumerate a positive fundamental right to education.3 However, it has long been debated whether the U.S. Constitution implicitly enumerates a positive fundamental right to education.4 Therefore, the Supreme Court and federal and state legislatures have been the catalysts through which the right to education has been developed. In federal constitutional law, there exist two types of rights. Here we will look at these types within the framework of education. One is a negative right to education, which was recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923). A negative right to education is the right to have the government not interfere with your attempt to acquire learning.5 The other is called a positive right to education which is something that the Supreme Court has never recognized in the context of education. A positive right would be an affirmative right that the government must provide a certain quantum or quality of education.6 In essence, the government would guarantee the citizenry a certain level of education that it must provide.7 In addition to positive and negative rights, federal constitutional rights can be seen as fundamental or non-fundamental rights. This issue of fundamental and non-fundamental will be addressed in the below subsection.
Technology is ontologically devastating, because it usurps all other modes of revealing. With every thing standing in reserve for our use, “distance” disappears (Heidegger, 1993:331). Here, Heidegger is referring to distance as an existential sense of our proximity to horizons: those between earth and sky, mortals and immortals. This blurring of borders is the main indicator of an unchecked anthropomorphism. This anthropomorphism that objectifies the world in order to exploit it is also one that creates the world in its own image, where everything that human kind comes into contact with becomes an extension of itself. Yet, human being as Dasein necessarily inhabits a “there” and so can never encounter only herself (Heidegger, 1993:332). Since human being is a thinking being-in-the-world, a situated and limited being, Heidegger can claim that the ultimate victory of technological human kind is a delusion. Its sovereignty would, however, not be any less catastrophic, because delusion may be come accepted as reality. Human nature and human freedom, in Heidegger's special sense of the word (1993:330), still lie in the balance. The Danger. The danger, therefore, is for Heidegger not the potential physical self-annihilation of humanity, but rather that intensive technological production will over power human's capacity for diverse modes of disclosure. Philosophic thought would be re placed with utilitarian cognition; artistic creativity would atrophy as a result of endless innovative production, and political action would be obviated by social en engineering. Heidegger's fear is that someday, calculative thinking would be accepted and practised as the only way of thinking. Calculative thinking is the type of thought that deals only with the quantifiable and the measurable. “Calculation refuses to let anything appear except what is count able ... Calculative thinking compels itself into a compulsion to master everything on the basis of the consequential correctness of its proce dure” (Heidegger, 1998:235). Most disturbing is that technological calculation and innovation may satisfy our needs to such an extent that we would not even notice what we had lost.
Although the thesis of the present book is that the Supreme Court functions to perpetuate the subordination of racial minorities in the United States, the argument that I wish to make is a structural argument rather than a conspiratorial one. I do not intend to suggest that Supreme Court justices commence their deliberations by asking themselves how they can best ensure that racial minorities never achieve political, economic or social parity with whites in the United States. Although some justices may on some occasions be consciously racist, it is not in this sort of racism that the subordinating power of the Supreme Court resides. Rather, my argument is that, for structural reasons, the institutional role that the Court is destined to play within our constitutional scheme of government is the role of assuring the continued subordination of racial minority interests. On the contrary, the most potent method of perpetuating minority subordination in the United States has proven to be through the intermittent issuance of highly visible minority victories.
Following its approval by the Parliament and Council, Horizon 2020 continues to advance with last week’s announcement of first calls. The launch of the Work Programme for 2014-2015 heralds the beginning of the funding application process for many businesses and researchers. In detailing the objectives, calls and topics for the first two years of Horizon 2020, the process of application for and allocation of the 15 billion euro budget begins.¶ The challenge-based approach of Horizon 2020 is expected to grant more freedom to applicants, and the inclusion of marine dimensions in every societal challenge that the programme addresses is, as such, a big win for the sector. JPI Oceans’ latest Management Board meeting saw expression of appreciation at the programmes’ inclusion of “Cross-cutting marine and maritime research, which offers great opportunity for cross-cutting calls and pan-European synergies.¶ The Blue Growth economy in the EU is expected to grow to 7 million people employed by 2020. Actions in this area will be in line with the EU Blue Growth Strategy and relevant EU policies, as well as provide international cooperation opportunities in particular for Atlantic Ocean research. The calls in this area invite, for example, proposals on Atlantic observation systems, an integrated response capacity to oil spills and marine pollution, climate change impacts on fisheries and aquaculture and ocean literacy.¶ Horizon 2020 is amongst the globe’s largest publicly funded research funds. Replacing the Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7) and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) the programme brings all EU-level funding for research and innovation under one roof for the first time.
On paper, the PLA stacks up pretty well when compared to the U.S. military, with about a million more active military members and similar scaled land forces. Beijing has also been recently investing heavily in its naval fleet and now has an estimated 200 more vessels than the United States and a new submarine program. Beijing attempted to show the world just how strong the PLA is during last September’s Military Parade, which marked the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and involved more than 12,000 troops, 500 pieces of military hardware, and 200 various aircraft types. But in a competition that historically favors quality over quantity, size doesn’t always matter—particularly in today’s technology driven warfare.
Yet even as we celebrate cooperation at the level of geopolitics and multilateral negotiations, we cannot ignore the more prosaic frictions that inevitably arise in such a broad and dynamic relationship. Recently, these have included spats over chickens and washing machines, while the latest issue revolves around tomatoes. Tomato disputes have a long history. With the advantages of ideal soil and climate conditions and low labor costs, Mexico became a major player in the U.S. market following the embargo placed on Cuba in 1962. After decades of tomato trade wars, the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1992 eliminated tariffs on Mexican tomatoes over a ten-year transition period, despite the opposition of Florida agricultural producers. In 1996, at the behest of Florida’s tomato industry, the U.S. Commerce Department initiated an anti-dumping investigation to determine whether tomato imports from Mexico were being sold at less than fair market value. To suspend the investigation, Mexican producers agreed to a minimum price for imports. This so-called “suspension agreement” has been honored for 16 years, with two renewals as well as adjustments of the reference price. Fast forward to the electoral year of 2012, and Florida tomato growers have requested that the Commerce Department end the suspension agreement so they can initiate a new anti-dumping investigation against Mexican tomatoes. They argue that the agreement is outdated and fails to protect them against the Mexican competition; their critics accuse them of a transparent attempt to use a swing state’s political clout on behalf of protectionist interests. The Mexican government is taking the threat to Mexico’s principal agricultural export very seriously. According to data from the Mexican Embassy in Washington DC, the tomato sector provides more than 350,000 jobs in Mexico, while exporting $2.1 billion worth of tomatoes last year, 93 percent of which were shipped to the U.S.
For many people the idea of anti-capitalism seems ridiculous. After all, look at the fantastic technological innovations in the goods and services produced by capitalist firms in recent years: smart phones and streaming movies; driverless cars and social media; Jumbotron screens at football games and video games connecting thousands of players around the world; every conceivable consumer product available on the internet for rapid home delivery; astounding increases in the productivity of labor through novel automation technologies; and on and on. And while it is true that income is unequally distributed in capitalist economies, it is also true that the array of consumption goods available and affordable for the average person, and even for the poor, has increased dramatically almost everywhere. Just compare the United States in the half century between 1965 and 2015: The percentage of Americans with air conditioners, cars, washing machines, dishwashers, televisions, and indoor plumbing has increased dramatically in those fifty years. Life expectancy is longer; infant mortality lower. The list goes on and on. And now, in the 21st century, this improvement in basic standards of living is happening even in the poorer regions of the world as well: look at the improvement in material standards of living of people in China since China embraced the free market. What’s more, look what happened when Russia and China tried an alternative to capitalism! Even aside from the political oppression and brutality of those regimes, they were economic failures. So, if you care about improving the lives of people, how can you be anticapitalist? That is one story, the standard story. Here is another story: The hallmark of capitalism is poverty in the midst of plenty. This is not the only thing wrong with capitalism, but it is the feature of capitalist economies that is its gravest failing. Especially the poverty of children who clearly bear no responsibility for their plight is morally reprehensible in rich societies where such poverty could be easily eliminated. Yes, there is economic growth, technological innovation, increasing productivity and a downward diffusion of consumer goods, but along with capitalist economic growth comes destitution for many whose livelihoods have been destroyed by the advance of capitalism, precariousness for those at the bottom of the capitalist labor market, and alienating and tedious work for the majority. Capitalism has generated massive increases in productivity and extravagant wealth for some, yet many people still struggle to make ends meet. Capitalism is an inequality enhancing machine as well as a growth machine. What’s more, it is becoming ever-clearer that capitalism, driven by the relentless search for profits, is destroying the environment. And in any case, the pivotal issue is not whether material conditions on average have improved in the long run within capitalist economies, but rather whether, looking forward from this point in history, things would be better for most people in an alternative kind of economy. It is true that the centralized, authoritarian state-run economies of twentieth century Russia and China were in many ways economic failures, but these are not the only possibilities. Both of these accounts are anchored in the realities of capitalism. It is not an illusion that capitalism has transformed the material conditions of life in the world and enormously increased human productivity; many people have benefited from this. But equally, it is not an illusion that capitalism generates great harms and perpetuates eliminable forms of human suffering. Where the real disagreement lies – a disagreement that is fundamental – is over whether it is possible to have the productivity, innovation and dynamism that we see in capitalism without the harms. Margaret Thatcher famously announced in the early 1980s, “There is No Alternative”; two decades later the World Social Forum declared “Another World is Possible”. My central argument is this: First, another world is indeed possible. Second, it would improve the conditions for human flourishing for most people. Third, elements of this new world are already being created in the world as it is. And finally, there are ways to move from here to there. Anti-capitalism is possible not simply as a moral stance towards the harms and injustices in the world in which we live, but as a practical stance towards building an alternative for greater human flourishing.
But given our unquenchable need for community and the unlikelihood of obtaining that community in a network, we are so desperate for any solution that we are driven to deceive ourselves about the nature of these liaisons. Whatever “caring” really means, it means something more than simple companionship or even the comradeship of shared interests. II In the growth of human society, families came first, communities second, and only much later came the institutions set up by the community to serve it. Most institutional rhetoric — the proclaiming of what is important — borrows its values from those of individual families that work well together. Particularly over the past century and a half in the United States, spokesmen for institutional life have demanded a role above and beyond service to families and communities. They have sought to command and prescribe as kings used to do, though there is an important difference. In the case of ancient kings, once beyond the range of their voices and trumpets you could usually do what you pleased; but in the case of modem institutions, the reach of technology is everywhere — there is no escape if the place where you live and the family you live in cannot provide sanctuary. 54 DUMBING US DOWN: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling Anna Kelly (order #3483) 60.241.123.40 Institutions, say their political philosophers, are better at creating marching orders for the human race than families are; therefore they should no longer be expected to follow but should lead. Institutional leaders have come to regard themselves as great synthetic fathers to millions of synthetic children, by which I mean to all of us. This theory sees us bound together in some abstract family relationship in which the state is the true mother and father; hence it insists on our first and best loyalty. “Ask not,” said President Kennedy, “what your country can do for you, but rather ask what you can do for your country.” Since the “you” in question is both real and human and the country you are alleged to possess is one of the most extreme of verbal abstractions, it will readily be seen that the president’s injunction is an expression of a synthetic family philosophy which regards “nation” as possessing a claim superior to the claim of “family”. If you see nothing wrong with this, then it is probable you also believe that, with a little tinkering, our schools will work just fine. But if you have a queer feeling about the image of yourself and your family as appendages of an abstraction, then we are on the same wavelength. In the latter case, we are ready to consider that we may need less school, not more. III I want to examine the destructive effects the false claim of institutional prerogative has on both individual and family life, a destructiveness equally profound whether the claim comes from a government, a corporation, or some other form of network. WE NEED LESS SCHOOL, NOT MORE 55 Anna Kelly (order #3483) 60.241.123.40 If we return to our original discussion of networks, it will be clear that every one of our national institutions is a place where men, women, and children are isolated according to some limited aspect of their total humanity: by age, and a few other considerations in the case of compulsory schooling, as well as by various other sorting mechanisms in the other institutional arenas. If performance within these narrow confines is conceived to be the supreme measure of success, if, for instance, an A average is considered the central purpose of adolescent life — the requirements for which take most of the time and attention of the aspirant — and if the worth of the individual is reckoned by victory or defeat in this abstract pursuit, then a social machine has been constructed which, by attaching purpose and meaning to essentially meaningless and fantastic behavior, will certainly dehumanize students, alienate them from their own human nature, and break the natural connection between them and their parents, to whom they would otherwise look for significant affirmations. Welcome to the world of mass schooling, which sets this goal as its supreme achievement. Are you sure we want more of it? As we approach the twenty-first century it is correct to say that the United States has become a nation of institutions, whereas it used to be a nation of communities. Large cities have great difficulty supporting healthy community life, partly because of the coming and going of strangers, partly because of space constrictions, partly because of poisoned environments, but mostly because of the constant competition of institutions and networks 56 DUMBING US DOWN: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling Anna Kelly (order #3483) 60.241.123.40 for the custody of children and old people, for monopolizing the time of everyone else in between. By isolating young and old from the working life of places and by isolating the working population from the lives of young and old, institutions and networks have brought about a fundamental disconnection of the generations. The griefs that arise from this have no synthetic remedy; no vibrant, satisfying communities can come into being where young and old are locked away. Here and there mutilated versions of community struggle to survive, as in places where cultural homogeneity has been fiercely protected — such as in Bensonhurst in Brooklyn or Polish Hill in Pittsburgh — but in the main, “community” in cities and suburbs is a thin illusion, confined to simulated events like street festivals. If you have moved from one neighborhood to another or from one suburb to another and have quickly forgotten the friends you left behind, then you will have experienced the phenomenon I refer to. Over ninety percent of the United States’ population now lives inside fifty urban aggregations. Having been concentrated there as the end product of fairly well-understood historical processes, they are denied a reciprocal part in any continuous, well-articulated community. They are profoundly alienated from their own human interests. What else could it mean that only half of our eligible citizens are registered to vote? And that of those a barely fifty percent do vote? In two-party jurisdictions a trifle over one-eighth of the citizenry is thus sufficient to elect public officials, assuming the vote splits fairly evenly. We’ve come a long way down the road to redefining as WE NEED LESS SCHOOL, NOT MORE 57 Anna Kelly (order #3483) 60.241.123.40 an option what used to be regarded as a duty, but that is what alienation from community life quickly accomplishes: indifference to almost everything. When one is offered institutional simulations of community, a steady diet of networks — involuntary like schools, or “voluntary” like isolated workplaces divorced from human variety — basic human needs are placed in the gravest jeopardy, a danger magnified many times in the case of children. Institutional goals, however sane and well-intentioned, are unable to harmonize deeply with the uniqueness of individual human goals. No matter how good the individuals who manage an institution are, institutions lack a conscience because they measure by accounting methods. Institutions are not the sum total of their personnel, or even of their leadership, but are independent of both and will exist after management has been completely replaced. They are ideas come to life, ideas in whose service all employees are but servomechanisms. The deepest purposes of these gigantic networks are to regulate and to make uniform. Since the logic of family and community is to give scope to variety around a central theme, whenever institutions intervene significantly in personal affairs they cause much damage. By redirecting the focus of our lives from families and communities to institutions and networks, we, in effect, anoint a machine our king. IV Nearly a century ago a French sociologist wrote that every institution’s unstated first goal is to survive and grow, not to undertake the mission it has nominally staked out for itself. Thus the first goal of a government 58 DUMBING US DOWN: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling Anna Kelly (order #3483) 60.241.123.40 postal service is not to deliver the mail; it is to provide protection for its employees and perhaps a modest status ladder for the more ambitious ones. The first goal of a permanent military organization is not to defend national security but to secure, in perpetuity, a fraction of the national wealth to distribute to its personnel. It was this philistine potential — that teaching the young for pay would inevitably expand into an institution for the protection of teachers, not students — that made Socrates condemn the Sophists so strongly long ago in ancient Greece. If this view of things troubles you, think of the New York City public school system in which I work, one of the largest business organizations on planet Earth. While the education administered by this abstract parent is illregarded by everybody, the institution’s right to compel its clientele to accept such dubious service is still guaranteed by the police. And forces are gathering to expand its reach still further — in the face of every evidence that it has been a disaster throughout its history.
A general right to immigrate also would conflict with American citizens’ right to self-government. Immigration can change the character of a society, for better or worse; large-scale immigration can change a society quickly, radically, and irrevocably (just ask the Tibetans). Since self-government is a fundamental and well-established human right, the citizens of particular nations arguably should retain, through their elected officials, significant control over immigration policies. As Michael Walzer puts it, in an influential discussion of immigration: “Admission and exclusion are at the core of communal independence. They suggest the deepest meaning of self-determination. Without them, there could not be communities of [a specific] character, historically stable, ongoing associations of men and women with some special commitment to one another and some special sense of their common life.”22 The citizens of a nation may work hard to create particular kinds of societies: societies that are sustainable, for example, or that limit inequalities of wealth, or that treat women and men as equals. They typically develop feelings of affiliation and social commitments that have great value in themselves and that enable communal projects that create further value. It seems wrong to suggest that these achievements, which may provide meaning, secure justice, and contribute substantially to people’s quality of life, must be compromised because people in other countries are having too many children, or have failed to create decent societies themselves. Such a situation does not call for the creation of a new right that undermines the self-government of others. Instead it suggests that would-be immigrants need to take up responsibilities for self-government that they and their leaders have neglected in their own countries.23
America has seen a dramatic increase in the number of so-called “deaths of despair”. Caused by opioid addiction, alcohol or drug overdose and suicide, these deaths have hit middle-aged white people without a college education particularly hard. The trend is extensive enough to have driven up the overall mortality rate, with the U.S. in the unusual position of being a rich country where life expectancy is falling rather than going up. Amid all this is a perhaps unexpected reality—the people who are most optimistic about their future are the most disadvantaged: poor black Americans, who are even slightly more optimistic than rich black people. And by poor, we mean a household of four earning less than $24,000 (£16,800) per year, which is effectively the official U.S. poverty line. Very different outlooks are revealed when black and white people are asked about their wellbeing. To measure the differences, we use an 11-point scale, where 0 is desperate and 10 is very optimistic.On this scale, black people are, on average, 1.1 points higher on the optimism scale than white people are. Black people on average score above 8, while the average for white people is 7. The gap across poor black people and poor white people is even larger, at 1.4 points. That is a significant gulf—greater than the difference between rich and poor people, which is 0.6 points. The average score for rich people is 7.5, while for poor people it is 6.9. The starkest disparity is found in the detail that poor black people are almost three times as likely to be a point higher on the optimism scale than poor white people. And poor black people are half as likely to report experiencing stress the previous day than poor white people. Desperation, stress, and worry are closely linked to a greater risk of premature death, regardless of income or race. People with low levels of optimism and high levels of stress and worry are more likely to die from deaths of despair, or to live in areas with high levels of such deaths. The link is strongest for poor white people without a college education, especially those who live in rural areas. Of course, this relationship can run both ways. Desperation can lead to premature death,but living in an area where many such deaths occur can itself be a potential cause of lack of hope, stress, and worry. The link between optimism and longevity is strong. Among Americans born between 1935 and 1945, those who reported higher levels of optimism as young adults were much more likely to be alive in 2015 than less optimistic people. We found that 86 percent of pessimists died by 2015, while only 77 percent of the optimists did. The explanations for these trends are complex, but economics and ambition play a part. For many years, blue-collar white people had some advantages over minorities, but they are now among the most disaffected parts of society and the most vulnerable to deaths of despair. Crucially, they are much more likely to report that their lives are worse than those of their parents and, in terms of stable employment and status, that is often the case. In contrast, black and Hispanic people are more likely to report that their lives are better than their parents’ lives. While disadvantage and discrimination still exist, minorities have been making gradual progress in narrowing gaps with white people in terms of their education, wages, and life expectancy. Some of this is because of concrete gains made by those communities. But much of the improvement is due to the relative decline in the incomes and status of poor white people—a trend associated with the hollowing-out of blue-collar jobs, which are decreasing in both number and stability at the same time as the market for high-skilled labor continues to prosper and grow.
Often economic collapse is accompanied by social chaos, civil unrest and sometimes a breakdown of law and order. Societal collapse usually refers to the fall or disintegration of human societies, often along with their life support systems. It broadly includes both quite abrupt societal failures typified by collapses, and more extended gradual declines of superpowers. Here only the former is included.
DR. CARLOS ENRIQUE ALFARO: First of all, thank you very much for inviting me to be a part of this event. I would also like to thank LexisNexis for their effort to promote the rule of law within every country of the world. I apologize for preparing and giving my presentation in English even though I am a Latin American. I am going to talk about a very special case called the United States--Section 211 Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1998. n14 This case is important because it involves the United States, Cuba, the European Union, the World Trade Organization, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property of 1985, or TRIPS. n15 TRIPS is important because it can trigger retaliatory measures and can be used as an excuse by other governments to violate existing IP regulations. What caught our attention about the Bacardi case was the fact that the United States is charged with violating the very same international trademark protections that were historically created to protect the United States from abuses of other less-developed countries in the 20th century. It has been claimed and disputed (in court cases and under the WTO-DSB) that Section 211 violates the Inter-American Convention of 1929 and the WTO Treaty of 1995 and provides both Cuba and the [*376] European Union with the legal basis for denying protection to U.S. trademarks in their territories. First, it is important to clarify that despite the political hostility between the United States and Cuba, both countries have respected the intellectual property rights they helped establish at the Inter-American Convention. More than 400 American companies have registered close to 5000 trademarks in Cuba, such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and even Starbucks. This number is increasing as restrictions on sales to Cuba are expected to be lifted in the near future. On the other hand, Cuban trademarks have also been registered in the US Trade Office for many years without issue. But this situation can change with the Bacardi n16 case. As I said before, the legislation could set up a precedent that other countries can use to cancel trademarks or to interfere for political reasons with intellectual property rights. Arab countries could cancel trademark rights for companies friendly to Israel. Pakistan could do the same with countries friendly with India. Curiously enough, Brazil is presently studying a congressional bill that authorizes the president to temporarily apply sanctions to companies and citizens of any country against which the WTO has authorized Brazil to take retaliatory measures. Sanctions could remain in place until the offending country abides by the WTO's curative directives and become available to Brazil. Allow me to provide little of history about the Bacardi case. The conflict began when leaders in the Cuban revolution expropriated all company-owned property. The two companies that produced rum in Cuba were the Havana Club owned by the Arechabala family and Bacardi, owned by the Bacardi family. Both lost their companies and they went into exile in the United States. Although the Arechabala family kept its trademark for a while, they allowed it to expire in 1973 (even though renewal would have probably only cost them $ 25). When the Arechabala family lost their company in Cuba, they applied and obtained trademark rights in the United States in 1976. Later, they formed a joint venture with Pernod Ricard from France and founded the Havana Club Holding. They transferred the trademark rights to the holding company, and the joint venture eventually registered its trademark in 183 countries. Meanwhile, Bacardi transferred its distillery operations to Puerto Rico in order to secure tariff benefits on a territory that technically belonged to the United States. This move allowed the firm to maintain its brand name when it left Cuba. The Bacardi headquarters were then registered tax-free in Bermuda and [*377] were later moved to Miami. In Miami, Bacardi became a very important company by establishing strong political connections. In the mid-90's, however, the sale of Havana Club through Cuba Export Pernod Ricard's venture exceeded sales of Bacardi in Europe, and Havana Club sales became a threat to the sales of Bacardi all over the world. Then, Bacardi began to sell Havana Club brand rum, which it produced in the Bahamas through a joint venture called Galleon, Bacardi & Co. Havana Club International sued Bacardi in the Southern District of New York and Bacardi temporarily stopped selling the Havana Club trademark in the United States. Bacardi then found the Arechabala family heirs in Spain and sought to form a joint venture or buy their trademarks or some kind of rights so that Bacardi could sell Havana Club rum in the United States. As a result of Bacardi's efforts, Jose Arechabala International was founded in Liechtenstein in 1997 and this new company sold Bacardi trademarks that the Arechabala family had long since relinquished. Less than one year after, by coincidence, Senator Forforia introduced Section 211 to prohibit Cuban nationals or their known Cuban successors in interest from protecting certain trademarks or trade names in the United States. Under Section 211, unless the original owners have explicitly consented, the US Patent and Trademark Office is prohibited from accepting or renewing registration applications (for trademarks, trade names, or commercial names) presented by Cuban nationals or their successors in interest who acquire the trademark or trade names from the Cuban government where the trademark or trade name had been used in connection with property confiscated without compensation on or after January 1st, 1959. Section 211 also prohibits US corporations from considering any false order or enforcing trademarks or claims of Cuban nationals or their successors in interest. Section 211 was challenged by the European community as being inconsistent with U.S. obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property of 1985, or TRIPS. n17 A World Trade Organization panel rejected most of the EC's claims except in deciding that Section 211(a)(2) was inconsistent with Article 42 of the TRIPS Agreement. Both the European Union and the United States appealed the decision, and the appellate body of the WTO held that Section 211 was not inconsistent with Article 42 but was inconsistent with (1) the national treatment requirements of the TRIPS agreement and the Paris Convention as amended in 1967, and (2) the most favored nation requirements of the TRIPS agreement. Under articles 21 and 22 of the understanding on [*378] the rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes, the WTO member whose measure is found to be inconsistent with WTO obligation must inform the DSB of its intentions with regard to the implementation of the rulings and recommendations of the DSB. The implementation is to take place within a reasonable period. The WTO has since requested that the U.S. alter its legislation in accordance with the appellate ruling. In March 2002, the U.S. agreed to comply with the WTO requirements by January 2003. Since then, however, the U.S. has requested several extensions. The international treaty, international property rights, and international law give states the right of retaliation if violations continue. If the U.S. Congress does not in due time approve a law that modifies Section 211 and comply with the international tribunal decision, Cuba has the right to retaliate against U.S. trademarks in Cuba. Cuba could, for example, sell its version of U.S. trademarked photos in island stores. These photos could filter in other markets and could produce similar situations to the photographs that we saw recently in Brazil. Others feel that the Bacardi case and the U.S. delay in adopting the WTO recommendations could set the precedent for other countries to cancel trademarks or play politics with international law. Fortunately, Section 211 was inactive, and Cuba has not attempted to violate the intellectual property protection of the U.S. trademarks. It is waiting for the enactment of the U.S. law that will modify Section 211. However, if Section 211 is not amended, Cuba will likely retaliate and jeopardize the potentially profitable future trade between the U.S. and Cuba. Thank you.
For the purpose of this Comment, what is important about these programs is not what they contain, but the fact that they represent a much larger role for the federal government in education. A growing body of legal scholarship argues that an increased role for the federal government in education is a normatively desirable development. One scholar, for instance, argues that limited state bureaucratic capabilities, which she asserts have developed compliance functions at the expense of true policy expertise, counsel in favor of an increased federal role.12 Likewise, Professor Kimberly Jenkins Robinson, who served in the General Counsel’s office at the U.S. Department of Education,13 noting the persistence of interstate educational disparities since Brown v. Board of Education, 14 argues that an increased federal role in education is necessary because history teaches that states are incapable, on their own, of addressing disparities in educational opportunity.15 Another scholar argues that the central role education has always held in our society necessitates recognition of education as a judicially-enforceable fundamental right.16 Similarly, Goodwin Liu, recently appointed to the California Supreme Court, argues that the very text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the concept of national citizenship at least authorizes, if not compels, the creation of a “common set of educational expectations for meaningful national citizenship.”17 However, increased federal involvement in education is worrisome for other reasons, explored below. This Comment pushes back on scholarship that supports federal solutions for the nation’s education issues and argues that countervailing considerations militate in favor of less federal involvement in education.
MECCA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s King Salman told an emergency Arab summit on Friday that decisive action was needed to stop Iranian “escalations” following attacks on Gulf oil assets, as U.S. officials said a military deployment had deterred Tehran. The right of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to defend their interests after the attacks on oil pumping stations in the kingdom and tankers off the UAE were supported in a Gulf Arab statement and a separate communique issued after the wider summit. Tehran denies any involvement in the attacks and in a sign of regional tensions, Iraq, which has good ties with neighboring Iran and Washington, said it objected to the Arab communique, which stated that any cooperation with Tehran should be based on “non-interference in other countries”. “The absence of a firm deterrent stance against Iranian behavior is what led to the escalation we see today,” King Salman told the two consecutive meetings late on Thursday. The ruler of the world’s top crude exporter said Shi’ite Iran’s development of nuclear and missile capabilities and its threats on world oil supplies posed a risk to regional and global security. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that attacks on four vessels near a major bunkering hub, just outside the Strait of Hormuz, were “efforts by Iranians to raise the price of crude oil around the world.” Riyadh accused Tehran of ordering the drone strikes. The attacks were claimed by the Iran-aligned Houthi group which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen for four years. U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said on Thursday that evidence of Iran being behind the tanker attacks would be presented to the U.N. Security Council as early as next week. “The kingdom is keen to preserve the stability and security of the region, to spare it the scourge of war and to realize peace and stability,” King Salman said.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (MarketWatch) — Yes, many capitalists are getting rich off the high seas, a vast reservoir of wealth holding 95% of the planet’s water, spanning 70% of the Earth’s surface. Often called the last frontier, a return to America’s 18th century Wild West. it’s virtually unregulated, a new free market where capitalists roam like pirates, plundering wealth and treating our oceans as a freebie gold mine and trash dump. Bad news for seven billion people living on the planet. And by 2050 we’ll be adding three billion more people. We already know we can’t feed 10 billion. Now we’re polluting their water. Won’t be enough clean water for all to drink, triggering wars. Yes, bad news getting worse: As Alan Sielen of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography warns in the Foreign Affairs journal: “Over the last several decades, human activities have so altered the basic chemistry of the seas that they are now experiencing evolution in reverse: a return to the barren primeval waters of hundreds of millions of years ago.” Capitalism is turning back evolutionary clock a billion years Evolution in reverse? Yes, planet Earth is regressing eons to an earlier primitive era. Unregulated free-market competition on the high seas is turning back the evolutionary clock. That doesn’t bother today’s short-term-thinking capitalists. But it should. Because, ironically, shifting evolution into reverse will also self-destruct the very global economy that capitalism needs for future growth. Today’s capitalists see another three billion people as the new customers needed to expand free markets globally. But in the process they are also cutting their own throats, unaware they’re pushing a hidden self-destruct button lodged in their brains. Nature designed all systems with these built-in termination buttons. Deny it all you want, but humans have our entrances and exits, as Shakespeare said. We all do. Same with economic systems: Yale’s Immanuel Wallerstein sees capitalism at the end of its 500-year cycle. Solar systems last for billions of years. Someday, as our sun cools, Earth could go the way of Mars. And the sun will eventually exit in a blazing supernova. Grabbing short-term profits, leaving long-term losses to the public Capitalists deny their role in their endgame, dismiss the long economic cycle. That’s natural. Capitalist brains are designed to focus on the short term, profits, high frequencies, microseconds, day-end closing prices, quarterly earnings, annual bonuses. Rarely longer. Myopia is the built-in self-destruct trigger for capitalists, their society, the human race, our planet’s water. Can’t blame them, the capitalist’s brain isn’t designed to think long-term. Why? Capitalists see a new world like the Wild West. No lawmen, just free-market competitors, free to do whatever they want, whenever, unregulated, uncontrolled, no restraints, skimming, mining, plundering the wealth of the high seas, free to use, misuse and abuse vast oceans of water at no real cost. Here are 10 ways capitalists are pocketing their short-term profits, leaving long-term losses for the public to pay: 1. Pollution creating new oceanic garbage dump Sielen’s imagery is powerful: “The oceans’ problems start with pollution, the most visible forms of which are the catastrophic spills from offshore oil and gas drilling or from tanker accidents.” But that “pollution pales in comparison to the much less spectacular waste that finds its way to the seas through rivers, pipes, runoff, and the air ... trash, plastic bags, bottles, cans” washing into “coastal waters or discarded by ships ... drifts out to sea ... forms epic gyres of floating waste” covering “hundreds of miles.” 2. Destruction of marine life costs jobs and more “The prospect of vanishing whales, polar bears, bluefin tuna, sea turtles, and wild coasts should be worrying enough on its own,” warns Sielen. “But the disruption of entire ecosystems threatens our very survival, since it is the healthy functioning of these diverse systems that sustains life on earth.” Destruction on this level” has massive consequences, and costs “humans dearly in terms of food, jobs, health, and quality of life.” 3. Toxic chemicals polluting our waters It gets far worse: “The most dangerous pollutants are chemicals” poisoning the oceans with toxins, says Sielen. They “travel great distances, accumulate in marine life, and move up the food chain.” Mercury from burning coal “rains down on the oceans, rivers, and lakes.” Each year hundreds of new untested industrial chemicals “build up slowly in the tissues of fish and shellfish,” get passed to larger creatures and humans “causing death, disease, and abnormalities,” adversely affecting “development of the brain, the neurologic system, and the reproductive system in humans.” 4. Deadly fertilizers are polluting oceans Add to this disaster scenario fertilizers, which are now rising at excessive levels causing “havoc on the natural environment,” an explosive growth of algae, decomposition, a loss of “oxygen needed to support complex marine life.” This trend is creating “dead zones devoid of the ocean life” that “have more than quadrupled” in a decade. 5. Humans are eating too many fish World population was less than 3 billion in 1950, 6 billion in 2000. Projected at 10 billion in 2050. Sielen warns: “Humans are simply killing and eating too many fish,” with fish supplies falling “dramatically.” Tuna, swordfish, halibut, flounder populations dropped 90% since 1950. “Human appetite has nearly wiped those populations out.” 6. Fish supplies disappear, demand is increasing And demand keeps growing as supplies “are rapidly dwindling.” Exploding prices add to the demand: This year, a 489-pound bluefin tuna sold for $1.7 million making it “profitable to employ airplanes and helicopters to scan the ocean for the fish that remain; against such technologies, marine animals don’t stand a chance.” Small fish like sardines, anchovy, herring, are also disappearing, meaning less food for bigger fish up the food chain. 7. Destructive, wasteful fishing methods Unfortunately, “modern industrial fishing fleets drag lines with thousands of hooks miles behind a vessel,” with “nets thousands of feet below the sea’s surface.” Untargeted seals, turtles, dolphins, whales, albatross get entangled, killing millions of tons each year. “Some of the most destructive fisheries discard 80% to 90%.” In the Gulf of Mexico, “for every pound of shrimp ... over three pounds of marine life is thrown away.” 8. Destroying marine habitats kills future growth Another factor destroying our oceans: “The destruction of the habitats that have allowed spectacular marine life to thrive for millennia,” says Sielen. And yet capitalism continues the “wholesale destruction of deep-ocean habitats ... submerged mountain chains called seamounts,” some higher than Mt Rainier. They are “homes to a rich variety of marine life.” Yet, industrial trawlers bulldoze their way” destroying “deep cold-water corals, some older than the California redwoods.” 9. Acid buildup in oceans weakens marine life “The buildup of acid in ocean waters,” warns Sielen “reduces the availability of calcium carbonate, a key building block for the skeletons and shells of corals, plankton, shellfish, and many other marine organisms” that need it “to grow and also to guard against predators.” 10. Our planet Earth is in hot water Echoing findings by 2,000 scientists in the recent Fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Sielen says scientists predict “climate change will drive the planet’s temperature up by between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of this century” causing “hotter oceans ... rising sea levels ... stronger storms” as the “life cycles of plants and animals are upended, changing migration patterns, causing other serious disruptions ... surface waters mixing less with cooler, deeper waters,” reducing phytoplankton population, “the foundation of the ocean’s food chain.” The recent Warsaw Agreement on Climate Change, like earlier United Nations accords in Kyoto and Copenhagen, exposes how capitalist power-players control governmental decision-makers, prompting Sielen’s final warning: “So long as pollution, overfishing, and ocean acidification remain concerns only for scientists ... little will change ... Diplomats and national security experts, who understand the potential for conflict in an overheated world, should realize that climate change might soon become a matter of war and peace ... Business leaders should understand better than most the direct links between healthy seas and healthy economies ... And government officials, who are entrusted with the public’s well-being, must surely see the importance of clean air, land, and water.” “The world faces a choice,” warns Sielen: “We do not have to return to an oceanic Stone Age.” But can we “summon the political will and moral courage to restore the seas to health before it is too late?” The consequences are catastrophic ... the risks enormous ... odds very long ... fuse short ... yet the denial may be too overwhelming.
The second way to read “democratic fundamentalism” is in terms of this hegemony, this basic framework so apparently immune to contestation and renegotiation. Democracy today is not the living breathing, activity of politics. The apparent suspension of social hierarchy in elections is the form of its opposite: it’s a disavowal of the antagonisms rupturing the social. In this way, democratic fundamentalism attempts to ensure that nothing will happen. It precludes politics, if by politics we have in mind actions that can produce major change. This second sense of democratic fundamentalism thus refers to the way democracy conditions and binds our thinking—anything that is not democratic is necessarily horrible, totalitarian, unacceptable to any rational person.¶   In sum, democratic universality appears in Zizek’s early thinking as a necessary fiction, as an impossible universality that opens up because of an excess, obstacle, or stain that impedes it. In the wake of the demise of socialism and expansion and intensification of capital and racist fundamentalisms, Zizek finds that this opening no longer exists, that it’s been closed off. As I detail below, the empty place of democracy now appears as a politically hopeless insofar as Capital, that other system that relies on disruption, crisis, and excess, displaces the excess necessary for democracy. Zizek writes, “Insofar as we play the democratic game of leaving the place of power empty, of accepting the gap between this place and our occupying it (which is the very gap of castration), are we—democrats—all not . . . faithful to castration?” Continued service to democracy today functions as our disavowal of the foreclosure of the political under global capital. Instead of a political practice structured around change—what one might expect from elections—we have instead a democratic fundamentalism that renders change unthinkable.¶   Contra Laclau, then, I read Zizek’s questioning of democracy as genuine. When he says that the “only question which confronts political philosophy today” is whether liberal democracy is “the ultimate horizon of our political practice,” he means it. He asks the question repeatedly, drawing from psychoanalysis and Marxism to explain our inability to think something new. Accordingly, in the following sections, I take up Zizek’s questioning, setting out, first, his formal account of democracy and clarifying the link he posits between democracy, violence, and capitalism. With this account in place, I take up his more recent arguments regarding democratic fundamentalism’s preclusion of politics. To this end, I contrast Zizek’s concern with the loss of a space for the political with alternative positions prominent in Left critical cultural and political theory.
Lastly, a nuclear deal between Russia and Venezuela will lock Russia into behavior and rhetoric that are inherently anti-American, jeopardizing the progress that has been made in U.S.-Russia relations since 2009. The history of this deal explains why this is the case. Russia offered Venezuela nuclear power in 2008, the absolute low-point in U.S.-Russia relations, when Russia was fighting a shooting war with Georgia, a U.S. partner that was supporting the NATO coalition in Afghanistan. The realization of the nuclear partnership will place Russia back into a position of confronting the West as it did two years ago when tensions were running high. Additionally, it will move Russia away from those nations that seek to prevent the spread of nuclear capabilities. In light of Russia’s large nuclear weapons stockpile, knowledge, and technology, this would be a costly development for global non-proliferation efforts. As a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Venezuela is within its rights to receive and operate civilian nuclear facilities. But observers who buy Chávez’s line that the program is intended for peaceful power generation may be naïve. Regardless, they miss an important point: the implications of the program are damaging, even if the intentions are sound.
We can agree that under the capitalist system one must sell their labor power and that it will be commodified as labor, which is to say it will be converted into a factor of production. We can agree that under the capitalist system the surplus value of social labor – not the bourgeois notion of individual work – is appropriated by the owners of the means of production and converted into profit. That is the basic structure of labor exploitation under capital.13 We must object, however, that labor exploitation is a commodification of ‘one’s own person’ or that the capitalist system ‘ultimately commodifies most people’. If this were true, then slavery as the conversion of person into property would simply be an extreme form of labor exploitation. Or, vice versa, exploitation would be an attenuated form of slavery. In either case, there would be only a difference of degree rather than kind between exploitation and slavery. At any rate, disabusing ourselves of anti-black racism would, for Smith, enable us to see that they inhabit the same logic and that black struggles against racial slavery are ultimately struggles against capitalism. Something similar happens with respect to Smith’s statement of the relation between racial slavery and settler colonialism. When she returns, in a more recent article on voting rights and native disappearance, to reprise her concept of racial slavery, she has this to say about the ideological formation of anti-black racism and its effects on critical intellectual production: Because Africa is the property of Europe, Africa must then appear as always, already colonized. […] The colonization of Africa must disappear so that Africa can appear as ontologically colonized. Only through this disavowed colonization can Black peoples be ontologically relegated to the status of property. Native peoples by contrast, are situated as potential citizens. Native peoples are described as ‘free’ people, albeit ‘uncivilized’. (Smith, 2013: 355) Smith rightly argues that the racist designation of native people as free, albeit uncivilized, precitizens is not a privilege (i.e. proximity to whiteness) in relation to the racist designation of black people as unfree anti-citizens incapable of civilization (i.e. antipode of whiteness) because the civilizing mission through which native peoples are forcibly assimilated into the settler colonial society is, in fact, a form and aspect of genocide. Yet, what is missed in the attempt to demonstrate that at is also, like Native Studies, concerned with colonization is the plain fact that colonization is not essential, much less prerequisite, to enslavement. In other words, to say that it is only through ‘disavowed colonization’ that black people can be ‘ontologically relegated to the status of property’ is a feint, just as it is to suggest that capitalism ‘ultimately commodifies most people’. In this case, enslavement would be enabled by a prior colonization that it extends perforce. If this were true, then slavery as the conversion of person into property would simply be an extreme form of colonization. Or, vice versa, colonization would be an attenuated form of slavery. In either case, there would be only a difference of degree rather than kind between colonization and slavery. At any rate, disabusing ourselves of anti-black racism would, for Smith, enable us to see that black struggles against racial slavery are ultimately struggles against colonialism. Colonization is not a necessary condition of enslavement because: 1) slaves need not be colonial subjects, or objects of colonial exploitation, and they do not face the fundamental directive of colonialism, ‘you, work for me’, though slaves often enough labor; and 2) slaves need not be settler colonial subjects, or objects of settler colonial genocide, since they do not face the fundamental directive ‘you, go away’, though slaves often enough are driven from their native land. But the crucial problem with this formulation of the relations between racial slavery, settler colonialism and capitalism (leaving aside any problems with the pillar of Orientalism) has to do with the drive to confound the position of blacks in order to describe them as exploited and colonized degree zero. Regarding the latter, Smith writes, ‘Africa is the property of Europe’; Africa rather than the African. As in the reduction of slavery to the exploitation of labor, there is here an elision of the permanent seizure of the body essential to enslavement.15 What can be done to a captive body? Anything whatsoever. The loss of sovereignty is a fait accompli, a byproduct rather than a precondition of enslavement. Genocide is endemic to enslavement insofar as slavery bans, legally and politically, the reproduction of enslaved peoples as peoples, indigenous or otherwise, whether they are removed from their native land, subjected to direct killing, unlivable conditions, or forced assimilation; or they are kept in place, allowed to live, provided adequate means, or supported in their cultural practices.16 Native Studies scholars misrecognize ‘the true horror of slavery’ as de-culturalization or the loss of sovereignty because they do not ask what slavery is in the most basic sense – its local and global histories, its legal and political structures, its social and economic functions, its psychosexual dynamics, and its philosophical consequences. Perhaps they do not want to know anything about it, as they evaluate it through the lens of their own loss and lament and redress it through the promise of their own political imagination. Slavery is not a loss that the self experiences – of language, lineage, land, or labor – but rather the loss of any self that could experience such loss. Any politics based in resurgence or recovery is bound to regard the slave as ‘the position of the unthought’ (Hartman and Wilderson, 2003).
The Public Charge Relevance in Immigration Policy As previously stated, public charge provisions have a longstanding history of being attached to immigration policies in order to safeguard public resources and exclude certain types of immigrants from a path to legalization. However, these types of provisions have not kept up with the developments in U.S. social policy, which has evolved to address these issues through Welfare Reform, Health Care Reform, among others. Arguably, public charge provisions in immigration policy have become irrelevant, especially concerning individuals with physical or mental disabilities. Within the immigration debate one of the most common misconceptions is the idea that immigrants are or will become a public burden taking advantage of public assistance programs. However, it is important to note that in 1996 with the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), provisions are already established to reduce and limit the availability of welfare programs to undocumented individuals. According to the National Association of Social Workers’ summary on the PRWORA , this law cuts approximately $55 billion that comes from reductions in the Food Stamp program, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program that undocumented immigrants would not qualify for.10 Similarly, the estimated 11.2 million undocumented immigrants residing in the U.S. are also ineligible for Medicaid and other means-tested federal benefits due to PRWORA.11 Although these are just a few examples of the social policies already in place to prevent individuals, especially undocumented immigrants, from becoming a “public charge” on the state, these outdated provisions also have impacts on the community at large. In its 1999 proposed rule and field guidance on the public charge, INS noted that “immigrants’ fears of obtaining these necessary medical and other benefits are not only causing them considerable harm, but are also jeopardizing the general public.”12 Furthermore, immigration and welfare policies also heavily restrict access to federal and state assistance programs even after an immigrant has gained legal permanent residency. The passage of PRWORA and IIRIRA in 1996 ushered in a new era of unprecedented restrictionism, especially for immigrant communities. Even where eligibility for immigrants was preserved by the 1996 laws or restored by subsequent legislation, many immigrant families hesitate to enroll in critical health care, job-training, nutrition, and cash assistance programs due to fear and confusion caused by the laws’ chilling effects. As a result, the participation of immigrants in public benefit programs has decreased sharply after passage of the 1996 law.13 10 National Association of Social Workers, “Personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996”. http://www.naswdc.org/advocacy/welfare/legislation/summary.pdf 11 Trends, 2010, Pew Hispanic Center, Washington, D.C., February 1, 2011, p. 25. 12 64 Fed. Reg. 28676 (May 26, 1999), http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-05-26/html/99-13188.htm (accessed on Jan. 10, 2013). 13 Michael Fix and Jeffrey Passel, “The Scope and Impact of Welfare Reform’s Immigrant Provisions” (Discussion Paper No. 02- 03), Assessing the New Federalism, Washington, DC: The Urban Institute, Jan. 2002. 6 Impacts on Immigrants with Disabilities In the year 2008 there was at least an estimated 15 percent of individuals in immigration proceedings with existing mental disorders/disabilities.14 This significant percentage would account for approximately 57,000 individuals. We can infer that with the increased rates of deportation under the Obama administration the percentage of individuals with disabilities in immigration proceedings has also increased. In the recent years there has been more attention towards the inhumane treatment of individuals within ICE detention facilities and the lack of representation in the immigration court process for individuals with disabilities. Initial screening is inadequate, the quality of care suffers, and the lack of an electronic records system further exacerbates these problems.15 The report by Travis Packer indicates that when individuals are in custody of immigration there is a screening process and standards to identify mental disorders, however it is not administered to every single individual.16 Unfortunately, the undiagnosed or lack of treatment of certain disorder within the immigration detention center cannot only affect negatively the individual’s physical and psychological health, but also the outcome of the immigration case. One of the victories out of exposing the maltreatment of individuals with disabilities is the initiative ICE has undergone to develop a “risk assessment tool” that will help identify mental disorders and who should be detained and the conditions under which that individual should be detained. 17 While little is known about the assessment tool, it sets a positive precedent and is a step in the right direction to uphold human rights of people with disabilities within the immigration context. Discrimination Under the Law Since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act more than 20 years ago – a landmark civil rights victory thanks to the struggle of disability rights groups – there have been many improvements against discrimination and towards a more inclusive environment for people with disabilities in the U.S. The U.S. government is justifiably proud of the progress it has made in protecting the rights of people with disabilities in the workplace, healthcare, education and public accommodations .In the immigration sphere, however, the U.S. has yet to provide similar substantive protections through U.S. constitutional law and international human rights standards. Public charge provisions are inherently discriminatory and fundamentally against the principles of the Americans with disabilities Act and the struggle of the organizations and individuals who fought for this civil rights victory. Although this legislation was approved four years after the Immigration Reform and Control Act, little effort has been made from the U.S. government to update immigration law within this context – further demonstrating the public charge’s irrelevance. 14Human Rights Watch, Deportation by default: mental disability, unfair hearings, and indefinite detention in the US immigration system, July 2010 http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/usdeportation0710_0.pdf 15.

Section 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act declares that: "Any alien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible."18 The legislation specifies that the factors to be taken into account in determining whether an alien is excludable include age, health, family status, assets, financial status, and education and skills. However, it is important to note that there has to be a clear definition of public charge as well as specific criteria that would make someone inadmissible. It is also troubling that the assessment and determination of inadmissibility under public charge is placed on the opinion of one individual that might have special consideration on one case over the other. In addition, Section 237(5) states that: "Any alien who, within five years after the date of entry, has become a public charge from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry is deportable."19 While the Immigration and Nationality Act excludes individuals with physical and mental disabilities, all applicants under immigration proceeding may also qualify for a special rule cancellation of removal under section 309 (f)(10)(A) of IIRIRA if they can establish that their deportation would result in “extreme hardship”. [For a list of “extreme hardship” contributing factors, see Appendix A] While there is a list of what would qualify for “extreme hardship”, every case must be reviewed on an individual basis in review of all the circumstances that the individual and family might face. The individual must present evidence that the deportation would cause extreme hardship beyond that associated with the deportation. Limitations of Waivers and Other Discretionary Procedures Each of the above mentioned policies includes “waivers” of inadmissibility which could potentially address some of the exclusions due to “public charge” determination or other grounds for inadmissibility. At the same time, the determination of “public charge” and other exclusions often rests on the discretion of either the Secretary of Homeland Security, Attorney General, or other consular level official handling the individual application. However, these types of waivers and discretionary provisions tend to be reactive and come into play only after individual cases have been identified. The issue with these types of reactive policies is that they create an inconsistent, and arguably less effective, process for reviewing cases (variance depends on individual consular staff or administrator in power) and also create an increased burden on already vulnerable individuals - having already expended their resources in time and monetary fees throughout the application process. 18 “INA: act 212 – General Classes of aliens ineligible to receive visas and ineligible for admission; waivers of inadmissibility” (USCIS webpage). http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM100 0000ecd190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&CH=act (last visited January 21, 2013). 19 “INA: act 237 – general classes of deportable aliens” (USCIS webpage). http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM100 0000ecd190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&CH=act 8 Policy Recommendations The following is a list of initial policy recommendation that federal legislators should consider in any discussion of a truly comprehensive immigration policy rooted in the dignity of immigrants communities. As previously mentioned, this is a preliminary document which includes recommendations based only on existing immigration policies. However, it is of utmost importance that immigrants with disabilities and other communities directly affected continue to be part of this discussion and are able to provide their assessment and input into upcoming immigration legislation. Our initial recommendations include : Eliminating the “Public Charge” Provision Given the expanded explanation of “public charge” under the Clinton administration coupled with the approval of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, any future comprehensive immigration policy which includes a path to legalization and status adjustment should exclude any “public charge” provision, and instead, enumerate ways in which individuals with mental or physical disabilities may apply for status adjustment, given the same considerations as other “able-bodied” individuals
In the absence of U.S. accession to the LOS Convention, the Deep Seabed Hard Minerals Resources Act (the “Resources Act”) governs conduct by U.S. nationals (citizens, vessels, and others subject to U.S. jurisdiction) that engage in exploration for, and commercial recovery of, hard mineral resources on the deep seabed outside of U.S. waters (i.e., the High Seas). See 30 U.S.C. § 1401 et seq. This Act, implemented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), establishes the licensing regime applicable to U.S. deep seabed mining ventures. The application of NOAA regulations interpreting the provisions of the Resources Act is largely uncharted. The regulations outline a comprehensive regime governing the issuance of exploration and production licenses and the conduct of commercial recovery operations. See 15 C.F.R. Parts 170, 171.
At the time of the GAO audit, TSA had improved its screener performance measures, but GAO concluded that it could benefit from monitoring private versus Federal screener performance. In April 2012, TSA added measures to better address the strategic goals and mission of screening in its assessments of screener performance at private and Federal airports. However, TSA did not separately monitor private screener and Federal screener performance. It made efforts to monitor screener performance at individual SPP airports, but these efforts did not provide information on SPP performance as a whole or across years, which made it difficult to identifY program trends. GAO noted that consistent monitoring of SPP versus non-SPP performance would help ensure that the screening and protection at SPP airports matched or exceeded that at non-SPP airports, and would ensure that SPP airports were operating as intended. GAO recommended TSA develop guidance for SPP applicants that included 1) TSA's criteria and process for assessing whether SPP participation would compromise security or detrimentally affect screening cost-efficiency or effectiveness; 2) how TSA would obtain and analyze cost information on screening cost-efficiency and effectiveness and the implications of airports not responding to related application questions; and 3) specific examples of additional information airports should consider providing to help TSA assess their suitability for SPP. GAO also recommended that TSA develop a mechanism to regularly monitor private versus Federal screener performance. TSA concurred with both recommendations. Conclusion Through our audit, we determined that TSA needed to improve some aspects of its administration of SPP to help avoid the risk of not selecting the best contractor to provide screening services. Because administration includes in-depth examination of airport applications and private contractor offers, which requires detailed calculations and analysis, TSA should ensure that decisionmakers have accurate information. TSA has taken steps to fully document its decisions on SPP applications and procurements and to improve its quality assurance procedures, including cost estimating and application document reviews.
Unfortunately Moscow’s current foreign policy—and that of supporters like president of Venezuela Hugo Chavez, albeit for different reasons—aims to embroil the continent in a contest with Washington. Russia still covets a global or even superpower status equal to that of the United States. Thus it wants to be a member of every international organization that exists whether it has any real interests in the area. Accordingly Russia expressed its interest in becoming an observer at the South American Defense Council that is part of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). Russia also wants to be an observer in the Latin American Association of Peace Operations Training Centres (ALCOPAZ).22 This craving for status lies at the heart of Russian foreign policy.23 In 1997 at the nadir of Russian fortunes, Sergey Rogov, Director of the Institute for US and Canadian Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences and an advisor to the government, wrote that: “Moscow should seek to preserve the special character of Russian-American relations. Washington should recognize the exceptional status of the Russian Federation in the formation of a new system of international relations, a role different from that which […] any other center of power plays in the global arena.”24 Consequently Russian policy in Latin America is ultimately an American policy. It aims to instrumentalize the region as a series of countries or even a weak but still discernible political bloc to support Russian positions against US dominance in world affairs. Therefore Latin American states that wish to challenge America need to rely on Moscow. Thus President Daniel Ortega pledged Nicaragua’s opposition to a “unipolar“ world and welcomed Russia’s presence in Latin America.25 Moscow’s policy is part of its larger effort, to realize this so-called multipolar world. Thus in November 2008 Lavrov stated that: “We welcome Latin America’s role in the efforts to democratize international relations in the context of the objectively growing multipolarity in the world. We believe that these processes are in the interests of the whole [of] mankind. Russia is interested in the closest cooperation with our Latin American partners in reply to the reciprocal interest they are showing.”26
Florida’s shoreline was apparently untouched by any raw petroleum before the Deepwater Horizon disaster smothered the western Panhandle with crude oil in June.¶ That’s according to what authorities consider to be the most exhaustive detective work yet on tar balls found along the state’s 1,260 miles of coast.¶ U.S. Coast Guard lab findings defy the long-standing belief that a regular ingredient of at least some of the tar balls that for years have turned up occasionally on state beaches is either crude spilled during offshore drilling or oil that seeped from natural vents under the Gulf.¶ Of the 192 batches of Florida tar-ball samples sent since mid-May to a Coast Guard laboratory in Connecticut, the vast majority have turned out to be lumps of heavy fuel oil, dark and syrupy as molasses and commonly used to power oceangoing ships.¶ None of the samples was identified as containing unprocessed, crude oil; a few samples proved to be nothing more than hardened mud; and nearly 20 samples had been severely altered by sunlight, oxygen and bacteria and were thought to be many months or years old, said Wayne Gronlund, manager of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Laboratory in Connecticut.¶
Methane emissions are worse than the conventional wisdom would have you believe, according to a new study by researchers at Stanford University. Methane, which is the primary component of natural gas, is an especially powerful greenhouse gas, packing more than two dozen times as much global warming potential than carbon dioxide. Traditionally, environmental regulators and energy industry groups have estimated methane emissions by multiplying the amount of methane emitted by a specific source – e.g., belching cattle or methane leaks at natural gas processing plants – by the number of that source type in a geographic region. For example, imagine that a cow emits 1/10 of a metric ton of methane every year. If the United States has 10 cows, the total methane emissions attributable to cattle is one metric ton annually. By adding the total methane emissions from cattle with the totals from every other source of methane emissions, we can derive the total methane emissions for the United States. That is how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has traditionally calculated methane emissions since the 1990s. If the methane emissions rates (e.g., how much methane does a cow emit in a year?) are wrong, the total estimated methane emissions are also wrong. Several studies have tested the accuracy of these traditional methane emissions estimates by using airplanes and towers to measure actual methane in the air. The new study, “Methane Leakage from North American Natural Gas Systems,” evaluated more than 200 of these atmospheric studies and concluded that the EPA’s methane emissions estimates are too low. The key take-away: the EPA is likely underestimating U.S. methane emissions from natural gas by at least 50% or more. “People who go out and actually measure methane pretty consistently find more emissions than we expect,” said Adam Brandt, an assistant professor of energy resources engineering at Stanford University and the study’s lead author. “Atmospheric tests covering the entire country indicate emissions around 50% more than EPA estimates. And that’s a moderate estimate.” This means that methane leaks from the natural gas system are likely to worse than previously thought. Nevertheless, generating electricity by burning gas rather than coal still reduces the total greenhouse effect over 100 years, the new analysis shows. Burning coal releases enormous amounts of carbon dioxide. Mining coal also releases a lot of methane. More importantly, the majority of methane emitted from the natural gas system can be traced to a relatively small number of large leaks, which means the problem would likely not be terribly difficult to fix. While natural gas is cleaner than coal when used for electric power, it is dirtier than diesel when used for transportation. The new study concluded that powering trucks and buses with natural gas instead of diesel fuel probably accelerates global warming, because diesel engines are relatively clean. Natural gas will only be cleaner than diesel if the gas system is less leaky than the EPA’s current estimate, which the study suggests is unlikely. “Fueling trucks and buses with natural gas may help local air quality and reduce oil imports, but it is not likely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Brandt. Even running passenger cars on natural gas instead of gasoline is probably on the borderline in terms of climate.” The study, which will be published in the February 14, 2014 issue of the journal Science, was supported by the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation.
Although I describe it more fully in the individual chapters, one of the noteworthy features of the third way tradition in environmental thought is its embrace of a pluralistic mode of environmental value and action that accommodates both the prudent use and the preservation of nature, rather than demanding that we must always choose between these commitments. It is a way of thinking, in other words, that accepts the interpenetrating character of intrinsic and instrumental values in experience, the basic continuity of means and ends in environmental thought and practice. As such, the third way tradition is a strand within environmentalism that cannot be accurately characterized as either narrowly anthropocentric or ecocentric. Rather, it incorporates critical elements of both sensibilities in a more holistic, balanced, and practical vision of human environmental experience. Furthermore, this pragmatic strain in environmental thought views humans as thoroughly embedded in natural systems. Yet this recognition does not lead to the conclusion that humans have carte blanche with respect to the natural world, or that there is no moral limit to the domination of human will over the landscape. Instead, the third way view supports a wider and more integrative perspective in which human ideals and interests (including economic interests, but also other nonmaterial social, cultural, and political values) are understood to be wrapped up in the natural and built environment, and are secured and promoted through deliberate and broad-based planning and conservation efforts. While respectful of wilderness geographies and values, this tradition nevertheless represents a retreat from pure preservationist forms of environmentalism to views that accommodate ecologically benign and adaptive forms of technological enterprise and sustainable community development on the landscape.
The Obama administration should make it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba by ending pre-travel approval, 59 House Democrats wrote Tuesday in a letter to the president.¶ This month marks the fourth anniversary of Obama's decision to lift all restrictions on family travel and remittances to the island; two years later, Obama allowed all Americans to participate in so-called “people-to-people” visits, educational exchanges carried out by licensed tour operators. Lawmakers now want individuals and groups to be able to travel under a general license: instead of having to get approval before their trip, visitors to Cuba would be able to travel without hassle but may have to produce supporting documentation upon their return that their visit met the letter of the law.¶ “There are no better ambassadors for democratic ideals than the American people,” Rep. Sam Farr (D-Calif.), who spearheaded the letter, said in a statement. “By including all forms of permissible travel under a general license, more Americans can engage in the kind of people-to-people diplomacy that can promote democratic change and advance human rights.”¶ The letter says that Cuba's decision in January to rescind restrictions on Cubans' travel to the United States gives the administration a “predicate for doing more.”¶ “Exercising your executive authority to allow all current categories of permissible travel, including people-to-people, to be carried out under the general license is the next logical step,” the letter says. “This action would speed the processes you have already unleashed: increasing opportunities for engagement and reconciliation, while also helping Cubans create more jobs and opportunities to further expand their independence.”
Empirical support for the economic growth rate is much weaker. The finding that poor economic performance is associated with a higher likelihood of territorial conflict initiation is significant only in Models 3–4.14 The weak results are not altogether surprising given the findings from prior literature. In accordance with the insignificant relationships of Models 1–2 and 5–6, Ostrom and Job (1986), for example, note that  the likelihood that a U.S. President will use force is uncertain, as the bad economy might create incentives both to divert the public’s attention with a foreign adventure and to focus on solving the economic problem, thus reducing the inclination to act abroad. Similarly, Fordham (1998a, 1998b), DeRouen (1995), and Gowa (1998) find no relation between a poor economy and U.S. use of force. Furthermore, Leeds and Davis (1997) conclude that the conflict-initiating behavior of 18 industrialized democracies is unrelated to economic conditions as do Pickering and Kisangani (2005) and Russett and Oneal (2001) in global studies. In contrast and more in line with my findings of a significant relationship (in Models 3–4), Hess and Orphanides (1995), for example, argue that economic recessions are linked with forceful action by an incumbent U.S. president. Furthermore, Fordham’s (2002) revision of Gowa’s (1998) analysis shows some effect of a bad economy and DeRouen and Peake (2002) report that U.S. use of force diverts the public’s attention from a poor economy. Among cross-national studies, Oneal and Russett (1997) report that slow growth increases the incidence of militarized disputes, as does Russett (1990)—but only for the United States; slow growth does not affect the behavior of other countries. Kisangani and Pickering (2007) report some significant associations, but they are sensitive to model specification, while Tir and Jasinski (2008) find a clearer link between economic underperformance and increased attacks on domestic ethnic minorities. While none of these works has focused on territorial diversions, my own inconsistent findings for economic growth fit well with the mixed results reported in the literature.15 Hypothesis 1 thus receives strong support via the unpopularity variable but only weak support via the economic growth variable. These results suggest that embattled leaders are much more likely to respond with territorial diversions to direct signs of their unpopularity (e.g., strikes, protests, riots) than to general background conditions such as economic malaise. Presumably, protesters can be distracted via territorial diversions while fixing the economy would take a more concerted and prolonged policy effort. Bad economic conditions seem to motivate only the most serious, fatal territorial confrontations. This implies that leaders may be reserving the most high-profile and risky diversions for the times when they are the most desperate, that is when their power is threatened both by signs of discontent with their rule and by more systemic problems plaguing the country (i.e., an underperforming economy).
While it might have been nice to hear the Secretary of State say on Meet The Press Sunday that “you just don’t in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped up pre-text,” that characterization of Russia’s involvement in Ukraine is not the kind of aggressive military response that’s going to reassure those who see this as an issue of strong Putin versus feckless Obama. To people inclined to condemn American “weakness” in the face of Russian aggression, John Kerry’s condemnation of Russia’s military incursion into Crimea might sound like more empty words.
Almost 33,000 native inhabitants, or 70 percent of Guam's nearly 47,000 registered voters, need to sign up with the government's decolonization registry for the plebiscite on their preferred political status to kick off. But as of May 31, 2014, only 6,760 have signed up. Robert Underwood, president of the University of Guam, told Kyodo News in an interview last year this could be because some local people are already comfortable with and enjoying the status quo, particularly the privileges provided by the U.S. government such as food stamps and education subsidies. Jeashalyn Fejaran, 18, who belongs to the native inhabitants called Chamorro, admits, "I'm pretty comfortable with where we're at right now," and also confesses to not being aware about the ongoing decolonization registry.
Thus, the United States cannot ease the problems China's leaders face without fundamentally altering the present international order. The recommendations of the accommodationists would have just that result. They would welcome China into the G-7 group of leading industrial powers and into the World Trade Organization, regardless of how fully China meets the existing standards of behavior. They would use U.S. pressure to dampen democratically expressed desires for independence in Taiwan. They would "de- link" the issue of human rights from other aspects of the U.S.-China relationship once and for all. They would expand the ties between the U.S. military and the Chinese military and would avoid using sanctions in response to Chinese violations of agreements on proliferation and trade. Allowing China to join the community of nations without regard to its behavior as a member of that community would indeed change the principles of the international order to suit the needs of China's leadership. But would even these concessions be enough? The answer is almost certainly no. To make the kind of accommodations necessary to rid Chinese leaders of their suspicions would, at last, require changing the essential character of the United States. The Clinton administration's top policymaker for Asia, Winston Lord, has complained that the United States appears to the Chinese and other Asians as "an international nanny, if not bully." But concern for the rights of peoples around the world is the product of America's universalist creed. The astonishing spread of democracy in the last 20 years owes a great deal to the way we threw our weight behind our beliefs. Even if we wanted to change this fundamental aspect of our national character, could we? America's new China hands may be foolish enough to believe that the ideological chasm separating the present Chinese regime and the American people can be bridged or ignored, but China's leaders are more realistic. A 1993 document produced by the Chinese military summed up the situation bluntly: "Because China and the United States have longstanding conflicts over their different ideologies, social systems, and foreign policies, it will prove impossible to fundamentally improve Sino-U.S. relations." It is worth recalling the historical analogy with which we began. As Paul Kennedy explains, Wilhelmine Germany could not have been appeased "unless the British were willing to accept a substantial diminution in national influence and safety." The new China hands wouldn't dare make such a grim recommendation to the United States. But the strategy of engagement -- an effort to steer a middle course between appeasement and containment -- may be the most perilous of all. It neither satisfies the demands of the emerging power nor deters that power effectively enough to prevent a serious confrontation. That is a fair description of the course Great Britain tried to follow before World War I, and Britain's experience illustrated a bitter truth of international affairs: Sometimes the policy that seems safest is the most dangerous, and the policy that appears most fraught with near-term risk offers the best chance of peace over the long run. In the long Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the years from 1981 through 1984 were a time of intense confrontation. Opponents of the Reagan administration's hard line clamored for accommodation, for ending the arms buildup, for a "nuclear freeze," for more summits, for " engagement." But the four years of tensions and confrontation were immediately followed by the most fruitful period of relations in Cold War history. The changes in the external and internal behavior of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s resulted at least in part from an American strategy that might be called "integration through containment and pressure for change." Such a strategy needs to be applied to China today. As long as China maintains its present form of government, it cannot be peacefully integrated into the international order. For China's current leaders, it is too risky to play by our rules -- yet our unwillingness to force them to play by our rules is too risky for the health of the international order. The United States cannot and should not be willing to upset the international order in the mistaken belief that accommodation is the best way to avoid a confrontation with China. We should hold the line instead and work for political change in Beijing. That means strengthening our military capabilities in the region, improving our security ties with friends and allies, and making clear that we will respond, with force if necessary, when China uses military intimidation or aggression to achieve its regional ambitions. It also means not trading with the Chinese military or doing business with firms the military owns or operates. And it means imposing stiff sanctions when we catch China engaging in nuclear proliferation. A successful containment strategy will require increasing, not decreasing, our overall defense capabilities. Eyre Crowe warned in 1907 that "the more we talk of the necessity of economising on our armaments, the more firmly will the Germans believe that we are tiring of the struggle, and that they will win by going on." Today, the perception of our military decline is already shaping Chinese calculations. In 1992, an internal Chinese government document said that America's "strength is in relative decline and that there are limits to what it can do." This perception needs to be dispelled as quickly as possible. Containment would seek to compel Beijing to choose political liberalization as the best way to safeguard their economic gains and win acceptance in the international community. That is why trading freely with China is not the answer. Delightful as the idea of getting rich while doing good may seem to American businessmen, the truth is that unrestricted trade with China will only help the Chinese dictatorship buy time and put off the hardest decisions. Remember, Soviet communism was not brought down by trade. Nor was Chilean dictatorship, nor South African apartheid. In all these cases, only substantial restrictions on regular commerce helped convince leaders to risk democratic reform. We need to force the Chinese leaders to make similar calculations of risk and benefit. That means we should deny most-favored-nation status as a way of putting pressure on Chinese leaders to open their system. We should block their membership in the World Trade Organization and the G-7 as long as they fail to live up to those organizations' high standards of economic and political behavior. And we should pay careful attention to the way the Chinese handle the coming transition in Hong Kong. When they crack down on pro-democracy forces, as they almost certainly will, we should be willing to use sanctions to punish them. The new China hands often declare that the alternative to engagement with China is its isolation. It isn't. During the Cold War, the United States somehow managed to contain the Soviets and hold summits with them at the same time. But we will need to go through periods of bad relations with China. We cannot define a "good" relationship by whether the Chinese are happy but by whether we are effectively defending our interests and principles. This new China strategy may seem counterproductive at first, because Chinese leaders would surely respond to it in a fury and with threatening gestures. But over time it is the only strategy with a chance of success, and it is less likely to result in serious confrontation than the current confused combination of containment and appeasement.
Special education and language-minority students are under-represented in charter schools, unless the schools are specifically targeted to these population groups (Arcia, 2006; Sattin-Bajaj & Suarez-Orozco, 2012; Scott, 2012). Even when the students are selected in a lottery, they are discouraged from attending charter schools when the schools do not provide the services they require.
On Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party’s previously-stated goal of gender equality “In the early communist era, there were a lot of changes brought about for women. “Even though women still had to assume the double burden of working in the workforce and then taking care of children and cooking in the home, the fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs, either in the cities or … in the fields, and so that brought women out of the confinements of the household, and so female labor force participation was really the highest in the world in the early communist era. “The rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do. And so, even today, you see the legacy of that early communist era, because China's female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries. Although, it's really falling dramatically with the onset of market reforms. But now, in the last couple of decades, you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality. “With the dismantling of the planned economies, so many women have been laid off relative to men, and the gender gap is rising exponentially in so many ways, and that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown, is because of that dissatisfaction with this huge gender gap, that women have to put themselves behind men. And so, many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair.” On why the Chinese government feels threatened by advocates of feminism “On the face of it, I mean, what these women are doing is actually in line with the Chinese government's expressed belief in gender equality. But if you look at the bigger situation of China now, the economic growth, the economic miracle of the past few decades, is basically over. “The workforce is shrinking, and birthrates are falling and the population is aging drastically. So the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates, and it's very aggressively pushing particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies. “But the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do, because these young feminists are telling other women, ‘No, you don't have to get married, you don't have to have babies if you don't want to.’ But in many ways, I believe that sexism and misogyny and the subjugation of women — pushing women to return to these traditional roles of dutiful wife and mother — all of that is at the core of what I call China's patriarchal authoritarianism.” On the tactics the Chinese government is using to push women into getting married and having more children “It's doing a lot of different things. First of all, there is very aggressive propaganda that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn 30; otherwise, if they wait too long, then their babies will have birth defects. And so I've seen, for example, People's Daily articles, which is official Chinese state media, that women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant. They should seize on their so-called best childbearing years. “Then there's also policies. So, the much-publicized, so-called one-child policy recently ended, so China officially now has a two-child policy. It's been encouraging or trying to push particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children. But in spite of this really dramatic policy change on population, the birth rates still fell last year, and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government as it looks to the future. “There's this huge confrontation now between the agenda of the government, which is pushing a very traditional gender norm, pushing women into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand, but then you have this enormous upswelling of particularly educated young women who are pushing back in every way, and so what is unfolding right now is just an extraordinary moment in China's history.” On the internet’s role in the Women’s Rights Movement in China, and how activists circumvent government censorship to share their message “More and more women went online and were sharing their stories. “This is what is so fascinating, because, in spite of the intense internet censorship — which has become incredibly sophisticated — these women, they're so imaginative that they find ways of circulating their message and getting around the censorship. “Just to give one example, there is one activist who when the hashtag ‘MeToo’ was being very heavily censored, this one young woman came up with the idea of using [the emojis] for rice and bunny, which is "mi tu" in Chinese, which sounds like ‘MeToo.’ And so that was one way that they were able to get around the censorship for a while. “They're continually playing this game of cat and mouse and coming up with new ways to get around the censorship … It goes to show you that just as much as the Chinese government has been very effective in controlling the free flow of information through heavy controls on the Internet, that in this era of global connectivity, where there are also a lot of young Chinese people who leave China ... they're constantly communicating individually with their friends back home. And so, it's very, very hard for the government to completely shut that communication down.”
One of the greatest controversies during the Bush presidency involved the U.S. invasion of Iraq. When it became evident after the invasion that hostilities in Iraq were not ceasing, Congress accused the President of overstepping his executive authority, bypassing Congress, and 56 invading Iraq solely on Presidential prerogative. After the first Gulf War, many politicians in Washington regretted not taking Saddam Hussein out of power when they had the chance. “Because of recent intelligence reports that Iraq had evaded UN resolutions requiring it to destroy all stocks of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and biological weapons…There were also reports that Iraq had not abandoned its efforts to develop nuclear weapons, another violation of UN resolutions” (Irons 222). The George W. Bush administration knew that Hussein posed a threat to national security and to the lives of his fellow Iraqis whom he was testing his biological weapons on. Through several attempts by the UN, the Bush administration warned Hussein that denying UN inspectors into the country to search for chemical and biological weapons would have serious repercussions. “In October 2002, Congress passed the Iraq Resolution to empower President Bush to use military force against Iraq. The administration told lawmakers and the public that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and had the capacity to inflict even greater damage on the United states than the 9/11 terrorist attacks” (Fisher 2011, 262). Louis Fisher in Defending Congress and the Constitution argues that the claims the Bush administration made to the public and Congress were far-fetched and driven by the administration preying upon the fears of the public (Fisher 2011, 223). Contained in the Iraq Resolution were assertions that the President’s constitutional power was to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States. Once again, Congress was being asked to authorize the president to begin a war, without a formal declaration. Whether such an authorization met the constitutional standard had become a moot point, since Congress had long ago abdicated its war- declaring power to the executive branch (Irons 234). Irons correctly states that the war-declaring power belongs to the executive.
Neoliberalism is a sociopolitical movement rooted in the struggles against socialism and communism in Europe in the early twentieth century, and which ultimately opposed and undermined social democracy in Western countries in the second half of that century. Its roots in the United States are found among right-wing libertarians, anti-communists and conservative traditionalists who gave rise to the New Right in the 1950s. The first national leader of the New Right was Barry Goldwater Jr., senator from Arizona. Known as Mr. Conservative, he is credited, among others, with the rebirth of the American conservative political movement that today consists of neoliberalism and neoconservatism. In the 1960s the New Right took on populist tones, became linked to the religious right, and began to focus on opposing the progress made by the civil rights movement on social issues. In 1971, Powell Jr. (1971), a corporate lawyer from Virginia and representative of the tobacco industry who would become a justice of the US Supreme Court in 1972, submitted a confidential memorandum to the US Chamber of Commerce in which he sounded the alarm against socialist, communist and fascist forces that sought to destroy America's free enterprise system. Although a moderate on the Supreme Court, Powell presented a perspective in which college students, liberal professors and the mass media are viewed as responsible for the criticisms of capitalism of the period. Powell's perspective was already evident among libertarians in the 1950s (Libertarian Press 1974). In his memo, Powell set forth a course of action for the Chamber of Commerce that included a multitude of activities and resources: (i) a staff of respected social science faculty, (ii) a staff of speakers who translate the works of the faculty for the public, (iii) a speaker's bureau, (iv) scholars who evaluate social science textbooks for balanced and fair treatment of free enterprise, (v) equal time for speakers on campuses, (vi) balanced faculties on the nation's campuses, (vii) surveillance and monitoring of national television and radio networks, (viii) scholarly journals for independent scholars who promote the free enterprise system, (ix) a mix of publications for the public, (x) paid advertisements promoting the virtues of free enterprise, (xi) direct engagement in the political arena, (xii) a staff of lawyers to influence the judiciary by acting as counsel amicus at the Supreme Court, (xiii) mobilization of stockholders through educational and political action programs, and (xiv) a more aggressive attitude by business leaders to participate in the political arena to promote the free enterprise system and punish those who would oppose it. All of these resources and activities, he urged, should meet standards of accuracy and professional excellence. Powell concluded his memo by arguing that threats to free enterprise are threats to individual freedom and that the nation had moved too far in the direction of state socialism. In retrospect, the shape of neoliberal efforts in this country follows the broad political contours set forth by Powell. Powell's view is complemented by those of Huntington (1975), who argued that the United States suffered from an "excess of democracy" as a result of the civil rights movement, which expanded participation among members of marginalized groups. Huntington was one of the editors and authors of The Crisis of Democracy , a work commissioned by the Trilateral Commission, which was formed by private interests in 1973 to foster cooperation among Western Europe, Japan, and North America. In his chapter "The United States," Huntington argued that "the effective participation of a democratic political system usually requires some measure of apathy and noninvolvement on the part of some individuals and groups" (114). American democracy, he argued, requires a "balanced existence." Not surprisingly, in 1973, a group of conservative legislators founded the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a non-profit organization which has been a powerful behind-the-scenes player in coordinating the neoliberal policy movement over the past several decades. Supported by major corporations and non-profit organizations, ALEC hosts state and national summits for conservative lawmakers and their supporters to present and advocate for hundreds of model legislative bills often drafted by corporations with the assistance of ALEC staffers. These model bills are then introduced by ALEC legislator "members" in state legislatures across the country (NRDC 2002; Center for Media and Democracy 2013). During the 1999 and 2000 legislative sessions more than 450 "model bills" were enacted into law (NRDC 2002), and 466 were identified in the 2013 legislative agenda targeting the following areas: (i) Voter ID and Stand Your Ground, (ii) wages and worker rights, (iii) public education, (iv) the environment and (v) citizen access to the courts (Center for Media and Democracy 2013). The Powell Memo, Huntington's views and the work of ALEC gave and continue to give concrete direction to the neoliberal movement in this country. As with all social and political movements, there are intellectuals whose works influence movement leaders. As such, the Powell Memo, Huntington's views and the work of ALEC reflect a broader political philosophy and perspective that emphasizes free enterprise, limited government and individual freedom. As a movement, neoliberalism consists of a mix of economic theories and political beliefs and ideologies that have been used to mobilize a policy movement on behalf of the American capitalist class that has shaped social and economic policies for more than four decades (Birch and Tickell 2010; Miller 2010). On the basis of the ideas of von Mises (1951), Hayek (1944), Knight (1946), Friedman (1962), Buchanan and Tullock (1962) and other free market economists (Ronald Coase, Gary Becker, and so on), the economic theories of neoliberalism emphasize monetarism in the shaping of economic policies (Palley 2004). Monetarists seek to control inflation by controlling the supply of money primarily through the setting of interest rates. Monetarism arose as a response to socialism and to Keynesian economics, which had difficulties addressing the problems of stagnation and inflation, or the stagflation that occurred in the early 1970s. Perhaps the work of Allan Greenspan, a monetarist who headed the Federal Reserve for several years before the Great Recession of 2007-2009, best exemplifies efforts to influence the economy by controlling the supply of money. Greenspan was a disciple of the radical conservative novelist, Ayn Rand, who influenced millions of readers with her own neoliberal ideas. Underlying the perspectives of neoliberal economists such as Hayek and Friedman, followers of von Mises (Johnson 1991a), a staunch right-wing libertarian (Libertarian Press 1974), are anti-socialist and anti-collectivist views. The political beliefs and ideology of neoliberalism emphasize, first and foremost, free market fundamentalism. To this are added the principles of radical individualism, limited government, and flexible labor (see figure 1 - See PDF,). Free market fundamentalism, the sine qua non for neoliberalism, emphasizes laissez faire ideas in which the economy is minimally regulated by government even as the state is used to implement neoliberal policies. According to Friedman (1994), he, Hayek and other monetarists believed in a "free society" in terms of nineteenth-century liberalism. What neoliberals mean by the term "freedom" is "economic freedom." That is, individuals should be free to pursue profits and wealth in an open market without being impeded by government regulations. Presumably, such individuals will do so responsibly without having a negative impact on others; neoliberal ideology has it that individuals are free to voluntarily enter into relations with others but should not negatively impact or harm others (Friedman 1987). Moreover, economic freedom is viewed as "the indispensable basis of all other freedoms" (Knight 1946; Libertarian Press 1974; von Mises 1998), a view that, if not purely ideological, is surely open to critique and debate (see Wootton 1945). Radical individualism emphasizes individual responsibility for economic and social well-being. It also privileges individual freedom of choice in the market over the public good. Individuals are free to pursue their interests within the boundaries of law and order, and they must not become dependent on government for their well-being. This is articulated in terms of an anti-entitlement view which negatively portrays the beneficiaries of social programs as "welfare cheats" living on government handouts (Reese 2005; Wacquant 2009a). Reductions of social programs occur through anti-tax initiatives. The perspective of limited government emphasizes involvement of the state in the maintenance of the conditions for the accumulation of capital, including a strong military, while emphasizing limited social programs and government services to the citizenry. Limited programs and services support the anti-entitlement view emphasized by radical individualism. The state, then, maintains the order necessary for competitive markets to function with minimum restraints. State intervention in the market beyond this point is viewed not only as unfair (Johnson 1991b) but as ultimately leading to socialism (von Mises 1998). In this model, individuals are free to pursue their economic interests or wealth, but they must also accept responsibility for taking care of themselves and their families without being dependent on government programs for their material well-being. Limited government is promoted through privatization of government services and through deregulation of the economy. Liberalization of the market, it is argued, allows individuals to be free from the restraints of market regulations, which is the cornerstone of neoliberalism. Deregulation was set in motion with the presidency of Jimmy Carter, gained momentum under Ronald Reagan, and has continued to this day (Meeropol 1998; Cooper 2009). Privatization is seen today in charter schools, prisons and detention centers, and many other functions previously carried out by government. A legitimating notion underlying privatization is the view that the market is more efficient and effective than government, a view that is not borne out in education, corrections, public infrastructure and other areas in which privatization has occurred and given rise to corruption (see Project on Government Oversight 2011). Finally, flexible labor is the principle that employers should have maximum flexibility in determining the conditions of employment, with the power to employ and dismiss workers without the burden of employment protection measures (see Solow 1998). Presumably this would permit firms to meet the demands of market dynamics and downturns in the business cycle. In this context, the pursuit of collective interests is virulently opposed through aggressive efforts to break up labor unions and other organizations that support workers and other group interests (Purcell 1993). Another way this principle is implemented is through the suppression of wages and benefits. This is achieved by promoting temporary employment and low-wage jobs, with workers tending to earn minimum wages without benefits (Abelda and Carr 2012). It is this principle of neoliberalism, for example, that underlies the attack on tenure in education and public higher education, and which has given rise to the number of adjunct faculty members across the nation. Simply put, the pursuit of group interests is viewed as wrongheaded, with the freedom of individuals maximized when the conditions detailed above prevail. Supposedly, under neoliberal capitalism, those who succeed in amassing wealth do so by creating and operating firms that provide job opportunities for others to do well - in this way, wealth trickles down to those willing to work hard, and the majority of the population benefits. With regard to racial domination and oppression, it is assumed that racism no longer exists and that all individuals are free to pursue their own well-being. There is even speculation of having entered a post-racial period, a view based mostly on the election of President Obama. In recent years, the emphasis has been on promoting color-blind approaches that circumvent intergroup issues. Indeed, from the neoliberal perspective, groups do not exist; they do not have an objective existence, only individuals exist. Thus, within the neoliberal framework, structural inequalities also are assumed to not exist. Supposedly, we live in an open society in which structural barriers such as institutional racism do not exist. Neoliberals, despite being market focused, frequently join forces with cultural reactionaries who are guided by nativistic tendencies and who oppose immigration and the full incorporation of racial and ethnic minorities into the nation's institutions. These views fuse together to support exclusionary policies based on absolutist values that oppose cultural pluralism and multiculturalism and negatively impact Latinos and other historically oppressed groups in the United States. The next section examines the ways by which neoliberalism and neoconservatism have limited the public spaces in which issues of race can be discussed. Race, Neoliberalism and Neoconservatism Although both Democrats and Republicans promote neoliberal policies, Republicans are much more likely to promote views that fuse neoliberal and neoconservative perspectives. The distinction made here between the two is that, while both are authoritarian perspectives, neoliberalism focuses principally on free market fundamentalism and neoconservatism represents cultural reactionary perspectives based on absolutist values used to preserve a national culture that opposes cultural relativism, affirmative action, abortion, gay marriages, and other civil and human rights issues. 2 Neoconservatism is in some ways consistent with and mixes with neoliberalism, especially on anti-taxation and anti-government, with the two movements comprising core elements of the New Right. Both deny the structural nature of American racism, holding that racism exists at the individual level and that individual choice allows individuals to pursue paths that will improve their lot in society. As a result, by promoting color-blind approaches in the various life areas, such as education and employment, individuals are to be treated in accordance with their levels of individual performance and accomplishments. These views, for example, were clearly behind the initiative in Arizona to pass and implement HB 2281, which targeted ethnic studies and declared that students in public schools "should be taught to treat and value each other as individuals and not based on ethnic background" (Arizona HB 2281 2010). This act amended Arizona statutes relating to school curriculum and was used to dismantle the Mexican American studies program at the Tucson Unified School District. HB 2281 prohibits classes designed primarily for members of a particular ethnic group and which promote ethnic solidarity. Opponents of Mexican American studies claimed the program violated HB 2281. In short, neoliberal views are now codified as law in the arena of education in Arizona, where, according to Tom Horne, former Arizona attorney general and former superintendent of Arizona's Department of Education, one's race is not important in this society; what is important are the skills and personal characteristics of the individual ( Horne v. Martinez 2011). Horne's ally, John Huppenthal, former superintendent of Arizona's Department of Education, who opposes teacher unions and supports charter schools, argues that we are engaged in the "... eternal battle of all time; the forces of collectivism against the forces of individual liberty ... right now in our country we're way out of balance. The forces of collectivism are suffocating us, it's a tidal wave that is threatening our individual liberties, and so we need, at the national level, to rebalance this and we need to make sure that what's going on in our schools rebalances this" (Western Free Press 2012). Similarly, anti-affirmative action policies prohibit preferential treatment on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender and so on. While these laws also tend to prohibit discrimination, this component usually goes unenforced. Indeed, legitimating political views of anti-affirmative action policies hold that such policies harm minorities themselves and hold them back in society primarily by subjecting them to the stigma of having failed to legitimately earn positions obtained through affirmative action procedures. In other words, it is for the good of minorities that affirmative action policies have been and should be eliminated. The denial of institutional racism, according to Robbins (2004, 3), removes racism from "the realm of history, cultural practices, and social relations of power." This perspective has the effect of displacing issues of race and racism from public discourses. Within the orbit of neoliberalism, then, structural inequalities are hidden by attributing the causes to the private and personal spheres (Davis 2007). By separating inequalities from the structural features of society and assigning them to the private sphere, the issue of racism itself is removed from the public sphere. The displacement of racism from the public sphere diminishes the spaces of public discourses in which its elimination can be framed and discussed. The result is the intensification of racial oppression both by making it invisible and by muting resistance by the oppressed. Added to these neoliberal and neoconservative pressures on Latino communities is a powerful assimilationist movement that attacks the cultural pluralism that was partially institutionalized in the sixties. This includes attacks on bilingualism in all sectors, including the voting ballot. This particular emphasis uses exclusion as a means to diminish the influence of the Latino vote and thereby diminishes the values and principles of US democracy.
One day after Washington and Havana agreed last May that "boat people" fleeing Cuba would no longer be guaranteed political asylum in the United States, 13 men were picked up aboard two rafts adrift in the Caribbean. Assured by the American and Cuban Governments that there would be no retribution against them, they were forcibly returned to their homes here. Ten months later, however, members of the group, the first to be handed over to the Cuban authorities under the agreement, contend that neither Government has lived up to its obligations. The Cuban Government, they complain, has from the day of their return carried out a campaign of reprisals, intimidation and harassment against them, while the United States has failed to prevent continued violations of the immigration accord the two nations had signed. In six hours of interviews in this industrial city 350 miles southeast of Havana, the returnees said they and several of their relatives had been systematically threatened by State Security agents, arrested on trumped-up charges or accused of working for the C.I.A. All but two are now without jobs because of their political status, they said, and the pair still employed are regularly harassed by co-workers, bosses or State Security officials. "For the two Governments, this agreement has been marvelous," said Ulises Cabale, 29, an electrician who has been assigned to a temporary work-training program to repair electrical meters. "But for us, it has been a disaster that leaves us in a worse position than ever." It was not possible to corroborate independently all the accusations the returnees made. But they offered specific details about actions taken against them, including dates and the names and ranks of the security officials said to be involved. All those interviewed said they were interested in making their situation known because they still wished to leave Cuba and hope eventually to be admitted to the United States. Under the May agreement, the Cuban Government promised to "insure that no action is taken against those migrants returned to Cuba as a consequence of their attempt to emigrate illegally." In return, the United States ended its 30-year policy of treating virtually all Cubans who reached American shores as political refugees, and was authorized to send diplomats from the American Interests Section, its quasi-embassy in Havana, to interview returning raft refugees to insure that the accord was being properly carried out. 'Illegal Departure' Is Still a Crime But the agreement does not "preclude the obligation of the Cuban authorities or society to act against such a person for other reasons or crimes committed before or after the attempt" to leave Cuba, Ricardo Alarcon, the Cuban official who negotiated the accord, noted a week after it was announced. Nor did Cuba revoke an "illegal departure" statute on its books, which the rafters here said has recently been used to detain and question several of them. The returnees said they had repeatedly told the American diplomats who are monitoring the accord of those and other reprisals being taken against them. But American officials have simply brushed aside their complaints, they said, and urged them to apply to a program that selects 20,000 Cubans each year for entry to the United States. "Every time the people from the American Interests Section come, they tell us we do not meet the requirements to be political refugees," said Felix Ivan Rodriguez, a 29-year-old cook. "They tell us we have no priority, that our best chance is to try our luck in the lottery, like everyone else." Human rights groups suggest that it is no accident that American officials are reluctant to pursue claims that the accord is being violated. Despite a recent heightening of tensions between Washington and Havana, they say, the Clinton Administration has a vested interest in preventing another flood of Cuban refugees toward Florida. "There is a conspiracy of self-interest and silence going on between two contending parties, the United States and Cuba, that victimizes these innocent asylum seekers," said Arthur Helton, director of the Forced Migration Projects of the Open Society Institute, a New York-based human rights group. "The last thing either Government wants to do is raise the question of the viability of the migration accords.
That means the same basic formula of decisively winning the white and male vote that delivered the Electoral College to Trump in 2016 could still apply no matter how much his administration is perceived as tottering. Democrats may assert that changing demography will make that a much harder trick to pull off with each passing year. They may also hope that working-class voters will eventually turn on Trump when he is perceived as failing them. But that hasn’t happened yet, and if the gang tackle of Trump in the media during his first 100 days hasn’t done it, the tipping point may never happen. That’s not what Democrats cheering the thought that Trump is the most unpopular president in history want to hear. Nor should Republicans count on this guaranteeing them success if things continue to head south for the administration. But Republicans may well retain enough of a critical mass of their core voters to hold on to contested congressional districts and Senate seats in 2018. And if the dynamic holds, Trump will have more than a fighting chance to replicate his victory in 2020.
According to sociologist David Lyon, surveillance is the “collection and processing of personal data, whether identifiable or not, for the purposes of influencing or managing those whose data have been garnered” (Lyon 2001, p. 2). Surveillance “tries to make visible the identities or the behaviors of people of interest to the agency in question” (Lyon 2002, p. 2). Surveillance, then, encompasses a diverse range of activities and processes concerned with scrutinizing people, their actions, and the spaces they inhabit. Surveillance, of course, has existed for centuries, and its methods have been continuously refined to broaden its reach and effectiveness. One notable example is English philosopher Jeremy Bentham’s model penitentiary, the Panopticon (Bentham 1995). Conceived in 1791, Bentham’s Panopticon prison was designed to maintain (by allusion, if not by fact) perpetual surveillance of its inhabitants: by placing prison guards in central tower with a one-way observation system surrounded by rooms for those to be watched, the subjects were unable to determine when they were being watched. Through this unique architectural design, Bentham believed that the constant threat that one could be surveilled at any time would force the subjects to internalize the effects of surveillance:
The lights will stay on in the federal government, and also in the countless laboratories and universities that depend on federal funding for scientific and medical research. That's one upshot of the bipartisan budget deal congressional negotiators reached late Sunday. The bill, clocking in at more than 1,600 pages, is likely to pass both houses of Congress and be signed into law by President Trump this week. It covers funding through September. This is welcome news for the research community, which had been shocked and dismayed by Trump's March 16 budget blueprint for fiscal 2018. What's unclear is whether the 2017 budget deal represents a full-throated repudiation of Trump's goals, or is just an act of political expediency — a rare bipartisan compromise designed to avoid an imminent government shutdown. Trump's “skinny budget” for 2018 calls for massive cuts to the National Institutes of Health, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy's Office of Science. A more detailed 2018 budget from Trump's Office of Management and Budget is expected to be released in the coming weeks. But in the meantime, Congress hadn't even passed a 2017 budget — something it was supposed to do last year. The government has been operating on temporary spending measures based on the 2016 budget. The administration in late March sent to the Hill some suggestions for reductions to the fiscal 2017 budget. Among the suggestions: Cut $300 million from four programs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), $50 million from the NASA science office, and $350 million from the National Science Foundation. [Trump's budget calls for seismic disruption in federally funded research] Science and medical research, however, have long received bipartisan support, and that political reality has not changed under the Trump administration. Senate passes spending deal The Senate passed a bipartisan spending agreement on May 4 to fund the government through September, sending the measure to President Trump to sign ahead of the May 5 deadline. Here are the Republican and Democratic wins in the $1 trillion funding package. The new budget deal calls for an additional $2 billion for NIH, including $300 million for the cancer “moonshot” initiative — the 21st Century Cures Act — championed by former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr. The funding for the moonshot drew praise from the Association of American Medical Colleges. The budget deal also includes $175 million more for the National Cancer Institute. The new bill includes a small cut to the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fully funded, however, are programs designed to prepare for pandemics or bioterrorism attacks. The CDC will have $35 million in emergency funding to deal with the lead crisis in Flint, Mich. The effort to combat the Zika virus will be allotted $394 million.
Japan and the United States cooperate closely in research and development of potential largescale methane hydrate production. In May, a U.S.-Japan field trial on Alaska’s north slope successfully extracted methane hydrates by pumping in and sequestering CO2 , demonstrating both energy supply and environmental benefits. In light of the transformational potential of eventual large-scale methane hydrate production, we recommend that the United States and Japan accelerate progress on researching and developing cost-effective and environmentally responsible production of methane hydrates. Moreover, the United States and Japan should commit to research and development of alternative energy technologies.
It is the agricultural sector, however, that provides some of the most substantial and intriguing opportunities for both trade with Cuba and the creation of entirely new businesses in the United States. In fact, agricultural products were the very first items traded between the United States and Cuba since the embargo in December of 2001, when two ships loaded with chicken and corn arrived in Havana.99 The potential for the U.S. agricultural sector is abundantly clear when the sheer volume of Cuba’s agricultural imports are taken into account. In 2008, Cuba imported approximately $1.8 billion in agricultural goods.100 Only approximately 40% of imported agricultural goods were from the United States, leaving over $1 billion of trade going to other countries.101 Cuba itself is very much in favor of increased agricultural trade with the United States simply for the logistical simplicity and cost-savings it would provide. 102 Import costs account for as much as 35% of the goods Cuba currently imports from its trading partners.103 Because Cuba is less than one hundred miles from the coast of the United States, the country is naturally eager to enter into trade relationships that lead to lower transportation costs.104 Cuban officials105 cite rice as just one example of an agricultural product that they would be interested in obtaining from the United States.106 Rice is a staple food for Cuban citizens, and they enjoy it with almost every meal.107 Presently, the bulk of their rice must be imported from Eastern Asia, meaning a long voyage by sea and the expenses that go along with shipping tons of goods across the Pacific Ocean.108 Rice exports alone present an enormous opportunity for U.S. producers. The United States is a major exporter of both processed and unprocessed rice, accounting for 10% of all international trade in rice each year.109 Half of annual U.S. rice sales come from the export market, and the United States is considered a reliable supplier of a quality product on the international market.110 The USDA estimates that if the current restrictions on trade were removed, Cuba could potentially exceed Mexico and Japan as the biggest importer of rice grown in the United States.111 As of September 2005, Cuba estimated that they could purchase more than one million metric tons of rice annually, but restrictions make it unlikely that import from the United States will go much beyond current levels of 712,000 metric tons.112 A key obstacle, according to Cuba, is the requirement that all shipments of agricultural products from the United States be paid for in cash before they leave port.113 This resulted in a reduction in rice exports to Cuba by nearly 50% from 2004 to 2005, according to the USA Rice Federation. 114
As the U.S. and British crises of democracy play themselves out, believers in democracy will have their work cut out for them to demonstrate that these two high-profile predicaments don’t reflect design flaws at the heart of modern democratic government. To prevent the concept of liberal democracy as a whole from being dragged down, proponents of the model need to address its obvious shortcomings and make a convincing case for how democracy can and does work.
Around the same time that a record low in Arctic sea ice was being recorded, a new report from the UK's House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee urged a halt to all oil and gas drilling in the Arctic, at least "until new safeguards are put in place." Committee chair Joan Walley MP said:¶ The shocking speed at which the Arctic sea ice is melting should be a wake-up call to the world that we need to phase out fossil fuels fast. Instead we are witnessing a reckless gold rush in this pristine wilderness as big companies and governments make a grab for the world's last untapped oil and gas reserves.¶ Caroline Lewis, member of the committee, warned that "the race to carve up the Arctic is accelerating faster than our regulatory or technical capacity to manage it."¶ But the record of corporate capitalism shows that powerful industrial forces will do all they can to lobby governments to allow for continued economic exploitation of the planet's resources. According to the US Geological Survey, within the Arctic Circle there are some 90 billion barrels of oil - 13 per cent of the planet's undiscovered oil reserves - and 30 per cent of its undiscovered natural gas. The race for corporate profits is now on, with Shell already committed to a "multi-year exploration program" in the Arctic.¶ The receding Arctic ice is a "business opportunity" for those wishing to exploit newly available shipping routes. Cargo that now goes via the Panama Canal or the Suez Canal will, in many cases, have a shorter Arctic route, ensuring "efficiency savings" for big business.¶ Companies are also licking their lips at the prospect at getting their hands on vast deposits of minerals as Greenland's ice cap recedes.¶ "For me, I wouldn't mind if the whole ice cap disappears," said Ole Christiansen, the chief executive of NunamMinerals, Greenland's largest homegrown mining company, with his eyes on a proposed gold mining site up the fjord from Nuuk, Greenland's capital. "As it melts, we're seeing new places with very attractive geology."¶ A good example of the psychopathic mind-set at the heart of corporate capitalism. Science writer Peter Gleick responded incredulously on Twitter: "25 foot sea rise?" For that is indeed the catastrophic scale of global sea level rise that would occur with the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.
Although the research clearly shows that adolescent civic participation promotes civic commitment, the overall trends indicate that the path from adolescent to early adulthood civic engagement is uncertain; service activity in high school has increased over recent decades, while civic engagement among young adults has declined (Putnam, 2000; Sax, Astin, Korn, & Mahoney, 1998, 1999; Sherrod, 2003). Moreover, the quality of civic learning experiences may have a greater impact than simply whether or not students were involved in civic activities, suggesting that there is more to civic development than early civic participation. For example, in one study justice-oriented service that exposed students to social inequities was more likely than general helping activities to raise students’ awareness of civic issues and support long-term civic commitment (Metz, McLellan, & Youniss, 2003). In another study, participation in activities rated as high quality, in which students solved real-world problems, interacted with perspectives different from their own, and analyzed the experience, had a more lasting impact on civic engagement than low quality participation (Ferreira, Azevedo, & Menezes, 2012). Mere participation in civic activity had little impact on students’ ability to analyze to construct personal meaning from the experience.
“Substantially. A relative and elastic term which should be interpreted in accordance with the context in which it isused. While it must be employed with care and discrimination, it must, nevertheless, be given effect.” 48
China’s economic growth has underpinned the changes in its strategy and force structure, as well as its rapid rate of military modernization. At the same time, China’s high rate of economic growth, the size of its gross domestic product (GDP), and its large population have made it a major force in the global economy. These economic underpinnings have given China the resources to become a major military power with increasingly advanced equipment and technology. If China’s growth continues, its strong economic base, steadily more advanced mix of civil and military technology, and increasingly well-trained and educated workforce will both bolster China’s prestige in the international system and lay the foundation for steady increases in Chinese military power. This makes the future stability and growth of China’s economy a critical underlying factor in assessing its military power. Moreover, China’s future role as a global power may well be defined more by its growing impact on the global economy. China’s role as a major trading partner and exporter may ultimately give it more influence and leverage in dealing with the US and the world than the modernization of its military forces and increases in power projection capability. Is Becoming an Economic Superpower a Prelude to Becoming a Military Superpower?
Indeed, there is reason to believe that there is a strong pull on capitalism in its current monopoly-finance phase to seek out more fossil-fuel intensive forms of production the more deeply it falls into the stagnation trap, resulting in repeated attempts to restart the growth engine by, in effect, giving it more gas. According to the Low Carbon Index, the carbon intensity of world production fell by 0.8 percent in 2009, and by 0.7 percent in 2010. However, in 2011 the carbon intensity of world production rose by 0.6 percent. “The economic recovery, where it has occurred, has been dirty.” The notion that a stagnant-prone capitalist growth economy (what Herman Daly calls a “failed growth economy”) would be even more intensively destructive of the environment was a thesis advanced as early as 1976 by the pioneering Marxist environmental sociologist Charles H. Anderson. As Anderson put it, “as the threat of stagnation mounts, so does the need for throughput in order to maintain tolerable growth rates.” The hope of many that peak crude oil production and the end of cheap oil would serve to limit carbon emissions has also proven false. It is clear that in the age of enhanced worldwide coal production, fracking, and tar sands oil there is no shortage of carbon with which to heat up the planet. Today’s known stocks of oil, coal, and gas reserves are at least five times the planet’s remaining carbon budget, amounting to 2.8 gigatons in carbon potential, and the signs are that the capitalist system intends to burn it all. As Bill McKibben observed in relation to these fossil-fuel reserves: “Yes, this coal and oil is still technically in the soil. But it’s already economically aboveground.” Corporations and governments count these carbon resources as financial assets, which means they are intended for exploitation. Not too long ago environmentalists were worried about the world running out of fossil fuels (especially crude oil); now this has been inverted by climate-change concerns. As bad as the climate crisis is, however, it is important to understand that it is only a part of the larger global ecological crisis—since climate change is merely one among a number of dangerous rifts in planetary boundaries arising from human transformations of the earth. Ocean acidification, destruction of the ozone layer, species extinction, the disruption of the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, growing fresh water shortages, land-cover change, and chemical pollution all represent global ecological transformations/crises. Already we have crossed the planetary boundaries (designated by scientists based on departure from Holocene conditions) not only in relation to climate change, but also with respect to species extinction and the nitrogen cycle. Species extinction is occurring at about a thousand times the “background rate,” a phenomenon known as the “sixth extinction” (referring back to the five previous periods of mass extinctions in earth history—the most recent of which, 65 million years ago, resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs). Nitrogen pollution now constitutes a major cause of dead zones in oceans. Other developing planetary rifts, such as ocean acidification (known as the “evil twin” of climate change since it is also caused by carbon emissions), and chronic loss of freshwater supplies, which is driving the global privatization of water, are of growing concern. All of this raises basic questions of survival: the ultimate crisis confronting humanity.
branford Marsalis has a song called “Dance of the Hei Gui” on his record entitled, I Heard You Twice the First Time. Scrolling the Internet, no one asked the question, what exactly is a Hei Gui? Let me explain with a basic Chinese lesson. Hei or 黑 means: black. Gui or 鬼means: ghost. If you put them together, they translate into the n-word. Why is this important? Well in this case, Marsalis is surely being ironic and using foreign racial epithets to make an artistic statement. Themusic was solid, but the title flew over most people’s heads. In the 1920’s the company Hawley & Hazel Chemical Co. from Hong Kong developed a toothpaste called “Darkie,” with a logo of a man in blackface with gleaming white teeth. Upon the company’s acquisition by Colgate-Palmolive in the 1980s its logo changed to a race-neutral top-hatted man, and was renamed “Darlie.” The problem, as people noted at the time, was that changing the English name simply absolved westerners of having to see a racial slur on a piece of consumer packaging. In Chinese though, the name stayed the same: “black man’s toothpaste.” Why the name wasn’t changed in the Chinese version is a good question, considering maintaining such a name only serves to reinforce racial stereotypes. Today, I can go into a shop here in Beijing and buy “Black Man” and “Black Sister” toothpastes. Recently, I was doing some research into the n-word here in China, and found some startling stuff. On the Chinese version of eBay, taobao.com, I found a medicine called, “n-word-oil” or 黑鬼油。The packaging from various manufacturers either had a black man with a rag on his head, with the word “darkie” written underneath his image, an Arab with a black beard, or no human logo at all. What is “n-word-oil”? Well, it turns out that this medicinal remedy is for muscle pain and a host of other ailments the Chinese have been using for a very long time. It’s ubiquitous in Chinese medicine shops worldwide, including in the U.S. Another product — a tanning oil — also is known as “n-word oil” in Chinese. I asked a Chinese friend, who’s 53, about this oil and he hadn’t heard of it. In fact, he didn’t believe it was called that until I showed him the picture, and he said he found the name offensive, and that if blacks knew about it they would find it very offensive. Why is this a problem? It reflects an attitude by some in China that has gone unchecked, because people ignore it since it’s in another language. But racism in any language is worthy of our attention. Africans and African-Americans are coming in increasing numbers to China to do business or to study, and it seems that China can no longer hide behind the fact that this is a medicinal remedy that has existed for over 100 years — that somehow being traditional gets them out of answering a charge on full-on racism. Also, Chinese people more than ever are involved in America in ways that are getting more and more complex given the financial closeness of the two nations. When people criticized “Darkie” toothpaste it forced a name change for the English-speaking world because consumers make businesses accountable. But “Darkie” toothpaste was for a Chinese consumer population, and by not changing the Chinese name these efforts didn’t go far enough. The manufacturers of “n-word oil” need to hear that people are onto them, and that as Americans we can choose to ban those retailers who offer offensive products — whether knowingly or not — in America. Amazon.com is one retailer that sells this very product under the direct translation, “black ghost oil.” China and their products are not immune to criticism just because we remain in financial debt to them.
Some of President Donald Trump’s staunchest backers tore into his decision to attack Syria late Friday night, arguing it was unnecessary, reactionary and even Clinton-esque. In tweet storms and video responses, they compared Trump’s decision to attack Syrian targets to actions taken by President George W. Bush or a hypothetical President Hillary Clinton. “We lost. War machine bombs syria. No evidence Assad did it. Sad warmongers hijacking our nation,” tweeted conservative author and radio host Michael Savage. Savage also posted a video discussing the missile strikes, tearing into Trump’s decision. There was a clear sense of disappointment among a certain strand of Trump supporter as the president announced a “precision strike” against the regime of Bashar Assad on Friday in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack last week. The anguish came from supporters who latched on to Trump’s “America first” promise during the campaign. They argued that Trump’s decision undermined his promise to disentangle the U.S. from global conflicts, saying it reeked of the same old, same old. “Donald Bush,” tweeted Mike Cernovich, a conservative author and once a staunch supporter of Trump. “Congratulations to the Trump administration for adopting the same failed foreign policy and ignoring of the constitution as the last two administrations,” tweeted Doug Stafford, a strategist for Sen. Rand Paul’s RANDPAC. Conservative author Ann Coulter retweeted a series of people questioning military action in Syria — as well as past tweets from Trump himself. Before his presidential bid, Trump argued former President Barack Obama would be foolish to take any action in Syria. Coulter also quoted a news story about former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe promising he could beat Trump if he ran against him and tweeted, “You might – if you promised no more “stupid wars.”" Trump has veered back and forth on U.S. activity in the country, insisting recently that he wanted the U.S. out of Syria as soon as possible. The president’s tone changed earlier this week, after reports emerged that Assad’s regime used chemical weapons in an attack over the weekend. He promised a U.S. response. For Trump supporters, the president’s decision to make good on that promise was cause for despair and disappointment. “After Trump’s first year we have: 1.3 trillion omnibus, no wall, war in Syria. Is Clinton secretly President?” wrote Lucian B. Wintrich, the D.C. bureau chief and White House correspondent for Gateway Pundit.
Analysts said that, faced with pressures from major currencies, including a strong US dollar and a weak Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan has only limited room for further appreciation.¶ In China's foreign exchange spot market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by 1% from the central parity rate each trading day.¶ Data show that the yuan has edged up 443 basis points against the US dollar since the first trading day of this year, compared to the 146 basis points it advanced for all of 2012.¶ Ding Zhijie, head of the School of Banking and Finance at the University of International Business and Economics, said the yuan's recent appreciation has been mainly pushed by recovering trade data in the first two months.¶ Abundant global liquidity caused by the latest round of quantitative easing in the United States and Europe, as well as a weakened Japanese yen that is likely to the induce collective appreciation of other East Asian currencies, also added to the yuan's appreciation pressure, Ding said.¶ Liu Yuhui, a finance scholar with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the yuan now faces dual pressures.¶ On one hand, the currency has to remain relatively weak in response to a strong dollar and a weak yen, but it also needs to be relatively strong in order to maintain a steady domestic financial market, Liu said.¶ On Friday, the US Department of the Treasury denied that major trade partners, including China, have manipulated their currencies, while warning Japan against the yen's competitive devaluation to gain trade advantages.¶ The US, however, said the yuan remains undervalued against the greenback.¶ Ding said the yuan's current exchange rate stood within the range of the equilibrium exchange rate, leaving limited room for further appreciation.¶ Uncertainty in external demand, according to Ding, will make China's foreign trade a weaker factor in supporting the yuan. As the US dollar is likely to go strong due to domestic economic recovery, the yuan would also be restricted from further gains against the dollar, he said.¶ Moreover, the yen's devaluation may worsen the trade balances of other East Asian countries in the coming months, making a collective currency depreciation not inconceivable, the economist forecast.¶ Also on Monday, Chinese official data showed that the country's GDP growth unexpectedly slowed to 7.7% in the first quarter of 2013, down from 7.9% during the final quarter of 2012.¶ Market sentiment over the tepid economic growth may also hamper the yuan from further appreciation, said Liu Dongliang, a senior analyst with China Merchants Bank.
The inherent mobility of sea power means largely what it does in the traditional role—modern technology allows global reach in three dimensions and almost instant operational coordination worldwide. But the primary barrier to mobility in crisis-contingency operations is not technological. If mobility is to be exercised, ships must actually sail, and it is here—in the commitment of resources to a crisis —that things become culturally problematic. Despite the need, the answer to a crisis contingency is not always to employ sea power immediately. This cultural hesitancy has two aspects. The first is so deeply ingrained in the American psyche that it is more a matter of legend than of practical discussion. The United States has a long-standing tradition of rejecting the use of military forces in the domestic context, a rejection that dates back to the Revolution. It was codified in law with the passing of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which directs that military forces (specifically the U.S. Army) cannot engage in domestic law enforcement.18 The legislation is often misinterpreted as meaning that any domestic use of military forces is illegal; that is not the case, but it is nevertheless widely believed in both civilian and military 56 NAVAL WAR COLLEGE REVIEW circles.19 Thus before naval forces can be committed to a crisis, a comprehensive legal review is often demanded, something that takes time—time that is usually not available. Another cultural barrier arises from service ethos. Bluntly, warships are designed and train to fight. In the modern high-tech era, naval warfare is a very specific (and expensive) proposition. It demands very sophisticated and specialized equipment. The radar on an Aegis cruiser, for example, is exceptionally good at tracking and destroying enemy aircraft—but only that. In a crisis contingency that marginalizes that purpose of a platform’s defining systems, the purpose of the platform itself could be called into question. According to this logic, if a vessel is employed (albeit successfully) for a purpose for which it is not designed, the door is opened for its increasing use for that purpose and not its proper one. In the grand scheme of things, warships used for other purposes are not training for war; in the short term this leads to a loss of readiness for combat, while in the longer term it could mean the elimination of platforms altogether in favor of others more suitable for noncombat missions. Although this seems to be a largely philosophical argument, in a shrinking budget environment it is not without a certain politically compelling logic. The effects of these factors are not insignificant. In recent crisis contingencies (the mass migration operations of 1994 and Katrina) the arrival of naval vessels was delayed while legal and operational impact issues were addressed, in the Katrina case so long as to become a national embarrassment.20 Bureaucratic reasons, not materiel, were the culprits, ultimately to the detriment of the response. Hesitancy can be fatal in an operation requiring rapid response, and culture and bureaucracy can conspire to encourage just that.
This vote, though, to replace half of the 242-seat house, is being seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ambitious economy policy. Dubbed "Abenomics", it was designed to help drag the world’s third biggest economy out of a two-decade deflationary spiral. It will also determine whether or not Abe will be able to push ahead with his cherished goal of revising the pacifist constitution - a huge departure from traditional post-war thinking. Such a move, on top of contentious security laws that significantly eased restrictions on the army, freeing them to fight overseas for the first time since World War Two, would constitute a source of even larger concerns - not only to a majority of the public in Japan, but also to neighbours such as China and South Korea, who still vividly remember atrocities committed by Japan in the first half of the the last century.
Biodiversity and ecosystem function arguments for conserving marine ecosystems also exist, just as they do for terrestrial ecosystems, but these arguments have thus far rarely been raised in political debates. For example, besides significant tourism values - the most economically valuable ecosystem service coral reefs provide, worldwide - coral reefs protect against storms and dampen other environmental fluctuations, services worth more than ten times the reefs' value for food production. n856 Waste treatment is another significant, non-extractive ecosystem function that intact coral reef ecosystems provide. n857 More generally, "ocean ecosystems play a major role in the global geochemical cycling of all the elements that represent the basic building blocks of living organisms, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur, as well as other less abundant but necessary elements." n858 In a very real and direct sense, therefore, human degradation of marine ecosystems impairs the planet's ability to support life. Maintaining biodiversity is often critical to maintaining the functions of marine ecosystems. Current evidence shows that, in general, an ecosystem's ability to keep functioning in the face of disturbance is strongly dependent on its biodiversity, "indicating that more diverse ecosystems are more stable." n859 Coral reef ecosystems are particularly dependent on their biodiversity. [*265] Most ecologists agree that the complexity of interactions and degree of interrelatedness among component species is higher on coral reefs than in any other marine environment. This implies that the ecosystem functioning that produces the most highly valued components is also complex and that many otherwise insignificant species have strong effects on sustaining the rest of the reef system. n860 Thus, maintaining and restoring the biodiversity of marine ecosystems is critical to maintaining and restoring the ecosystem services that they provide. Non-use biodiversity values for marine ecosystems have been calculated in the wake of marine disasters, like the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. n861 Similar calculations could derive preservation values for marine wilderness. However, economic value, or economic value equivalents, should not be "the sole or even primary justification for conservation of ocean ecosystems. Ethical arguments also have considerable force and merit." n862 At the forefront of such arguments should be a recognition of how little we know about the sea - and about the actual effect of human activities on marine ecosystems. The United States has traditionally failed to protect marine ecosystems because it was difficult to detect anthropogenic harm to the oceans, but we now know that such harm is occurring - even though we are not completely sure about causation or about how to fix every problem. Ecosystems like the NWHI coral reef ecosystem should inspire lawmakers and policymakers to admit that most of the time we really do not know what we are doing to the sea and hence should be preserving marine wilderness whenever we can - especially when the United States has within its territory relatively pristine marine ecosystems that may be unique in the world. We may not know much about the sea, but we do know this much: if we kill the ocean we kill ourselves, and we will take most of the biosphere with us. The Black Sea is almost dead, n863 its once-complex and productive ecosystem almost entirely replaced by a monoculture of comb jellies, "starving out fish and dolphins, emptying fishermen's nets, and converting the web of life into brainless, wraith-like blobs of jelly." n864 More importantly, the Black Sea is not necessarily unique.
Northern Alaska’s environment and culture have already been significantly affected by oil infrastructure and activities. There have been many benefits to North Slope residents including more jobs and improved medical care and schools. These economic benefits have been accompanied by environmental and social consequences, including effects of the roads, infrastructure and activities of oil exploration and production on the terrain, plants, animals and peoples of the North Slope and the adjacent marine environment. Although a large body of research has assessed actual and potential effects of oil and gas activities and infrastructure, no integrated, comprehensive analysis of cumulative effects has previously been attempted. Cumulative effects can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time or within an area. In response to a request from Congress, the National Academies convened the Committee on Cumulative Environmental Effects of Oil and Gas Activities on Alaska’s North Slope to assess probable cumulative effects of oil and gas activities on various receptors—that is components of the physical, biological, and human systems of the region. The committee’s consensus report assesses both present and likely future cumulative effects on the North Slope and adjacent marine waters for the time period of 1965 to 2025 (in some cases to 2050).
The Chief Coordinator of the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston (Ret'd), said reports that the Chinese ship, Haixun 01, had detected electronic pulse signals in the Indian Ocean related to MH370 could not be verified at this point in time.¶ "I have been advised that a series of sounds have been detected by a Chinese ship in the search area. The characteristics reported are consistent with the aircraft black box. A number of white objects were also sighted on the surface about 90 kilometres from the detection area. However, there is no confirmation at this stage that the signals and the objects are related to the missing aircraft,“ Air Chief Marshal Houston (Ret'd) said.¶ "Advice tonight from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau is that they cannot verify any connection to the missing aircraft.¶ "The RCC in Australia has spoken to the RCC in China and asked for any further information that may be relevant.¶ "The deployment of RAAF assets to the area where the Chinese ship detected the sounds is being considered.
One of President Donald Trump's proposed initiatives that has drawn the ire of conservatives is his desire to push through massive infrastructure spending. The president did little to assuage such concerns when he told Robert Draper of New York Times Magazine that it was necessary to "prime the pump" and "spend money to make a lot more money." "In order get this [economy] going, and going big league, and having the jobs coming in and the taxes that will be cut very substantially and the regulations that’ll be going, we're going to have to prime the pump to some extent," Trump said. "In other words: Spend money to make a lot more money in the future. And that'll happen." Draper sardonically noted, "A clearer elucidation of Keynesian liberalism could not have been delivered by Obama." Here are eight reasons why spending on infrastructure won't fix the economy. 1. It's based on the flawed theory of Keynesian economics. Keynesian theory is predicated on the notion that artificially increasing demand by opening the spigots of the federal government and allowing money to rain down on the economy will somehow magically solve the country's economic woes. The flaw in this theory is the idea that money cannot simply appear out of thin air; in actuality the money has to be taken from elsewhere in the economy, "whether through increased taxes, increased borrowing, or increased inflation," notes entitlement and budget policy analyst Peter Ferrara. "All of those drain an equivalent amount of resources from the private sector, leaving no net increase for the economy, if not a net, effective loss," Ferrara wrote in Forbes. Mark Levin also gave a thorough explanation on this in his 2009 bestseller Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto: The government does not add value to the economy. It removes value from the economy by imposing taxes on one citizen and providing cash to another. Or it borrows money that would otherwise be used by investors and redistributes it elsewhere. Or it prints more money and threatens the value of the dollar. Nothing is stimulated. Spending power is not increased. Moreover, politicians and bureaucrats are substituting their uninformed, largely political decisions for those of the marketplace.
The common theme of these assertions is that the U.S. is drifting toward Asia and away from Europe—and the EU—and that a TTIP is one means of bringing the U.S. back. In reality, it is far from plausible that the U.S. strategic commitment to the defense of Europe and the transatlantic ties forged during and after World War II can be replaced by negotiations over marine equipment safety standards, arguments about subsidies to Boeing and Airbus, and complaints about French restrictions on U.S. television shows. But these claims are made; they are taken seriously; and they form, on the EU side, a central reason for the EU’s enthusiasm for a TTIP. The timing of a TTIP is itself revealing. The initial consideration of a TTIP began at the EU–U.S. Summit meeting on November 28, 2011, barely a month after then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton published her article on “America’s Pacific Century,” which heralded the “pivot to Asia” policy by calling for “a substantially increased investment—diplomatic, economic, strategic, and otherwise—in the Asia–Pacific region.”[24] From the EU’s point of view, a TTIP is a natural response to the “pivot.” The U.S. view of a TTIP is somewhat different. The Obama Administration supports the EU and a TTIP not because it cares deeply about Europe, but because it does not care deeply. It is easier for the U.S. to outsource U.S. policy toward Europe and the European periphery to the EU than it is to dedicate American time and attention to it. The TTIP is, in this sense, a bone thrown to the EU by an Administration that is not particularly interested in the region. The EU’s enthusiasm for a TTIP is misguided. The EU is being bought off cheaply by a few nice words and a trade measure behind which the Administration has put little weight in exchange for being silent about the broader U.S. disengagement from Europe. But the key to U.S. support for a TTIP—a sentiment that is increasingly shared, or at least stated, by European leaders—is not about Europe at all.
Contemporary psychoanalytic notions of bisexuality continue to rely on a number of grossly outdated theoretical assumptions, which may be summarized as follows: (1) biological sex, gender and object choice imply each other and are virtually synonymous; (2) sexuality develops in a linear fashion, from the undifferentiated, infantile bi-sexuality to a differentiated, mature mono-sexuality; and (3) disharmonious gender identity signifies psychopathology. Unlike the psychoanalytic ideas about homosexuality, which have been subjected to extensive critique within the psychoanalytic establishment, the concept of bisexuality is used in roughly the same ways today as it was in Freud’s lifetime. In addition to being rooted in the views of sexuality no longer held true in Western culture, the psychoanalytic concept of bisexuality is overly theoretical; postulated as a universal, essential human quality, it is quite removed from the lived experiences of bisexual people. Although the role of bisexuality as the bedrock of psychoanalytic theory remains unquestioned, there exists “relatively little analytic data on bisexuality as behavior and lifestyle” (Richards, 2000, p. 38). And unfortunately, the contemporary blends of psychoanalysis and queer theory are no panacea, as authors writing from that perspective tend, on their quest for sexual fluidity, to omit bisexuality altogether. The current situation with regards to psychoanalytic theorizing on bisexuality is reminiscent of what happened earlier with homosexuality: until a few decades ago, heterosexual analysts were the ones writing about homosexuality, of which they had no firsthand knowledge, while those experiencing homosexual lifestyles had no voice, as they were either barred from admission into psychoanalytic institutes or had to remain closeted within them. It was only when gay- and lesbian-identified analysts were finally able to voice their ideas that the questioning of inaccurate and pathologizing psychoanalytic notions of homosexuality could begin. Because the bisexual community is developing and exerting its influence on the culture at large differently from the gay community, it should not be expected that the same processes will occur. Nonetheless, to initiate the process of change in the psychoanalytic thinking on bisexuality, it is vital that bi-identified analytic practitioners make themselves heard, critiquing the theory on its own premises and offering viable alternative conceptualizations. What could such alternative conceptualizations look like? First, I suggest that the experience-distant (Kohut, 1971) theorizing on bisexuality that currently dominates psychoanalytic theory needs to be replaced with experience-near theorizing. In experience-near theories, individuals’ subjective experiences are taken as the starting point, and theoretical concepts are developed in an effort to best capture these experiences. To counteract the century-old tradition of relegating bisexuality into the mythical past (the first years of life), experience-near theorizing should focus on later experiences, which can be clearly remembered rather than deduced. Second, bisexuality research produced outside of psychoanalysis in psychology and social sciences needs to be inserted into psychoanalytic theory and rearticulated in psychoanalytic terms. It is through its distrust of and avoidance of contact with other disciplines that psychoanalysis has managed to preserve its outdated assumptions about bisexuality. To initiate a conceptual revision within the field, disciplinary boundaries need to be loosened. Third, queer theory should be used alongside the experience-near theory of bisexuality, for the two have an untapped potential to complement each other. While queer theory is indispensable for deconstructing heteronormative conceptions of gender and sexuality, thereby clearing up space for new ways of thinking, bisexuality, as an embodied, grounded practice can be used to fill up some of that space. While queer theory skillfully articulates what is wrong with heteronormativity, experience-near theory of bisexuality can be used to construct alternative ways of being. Through these interventions, bisexuality can be reinstated at the center of psychoanalytic theory—this time, not as a vague archaic concept but as a transformative practice. In the meantime, psychoanalytically oriented bi-friendly clinicians and writers are advised to adapt a critical stance toward psychoanalytic ideas about bisexuality and make use of bisexuality research produced in other fields.
Though its military decline has devastated the island’s power projection, it continues to court substitute replacements to past Soviet patronage. Militarily these solicitations epitomize the adage that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” The most obvious candidate is the current country of its old state sponsor, Russia. Over the last few years, relations with Russia have rekindled. While lacking its historic ideological alignment, the longstanding alliance against the U.S. still has significant geo-political appeal to both countries. As recently as 2008, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev visited Havana for those purposes. Later that same year, the Russian Navy made its first port call on the island in several decades. Raúl Castro’s reciprocated with a Moscow visit the following year. A closer parallel to the USSR-Cuban alignments, China has also intensified its affairs with the GOC. Also in 2008, Chinese Paramount Lead Hu Jintao visited Cuba. During the visit, the communist countries signed dozens of agreements including significant Foreign Direct Investments to upgrade the island’s oil refining capabilities.”53 Finally, Cuban-Iranian relations have significantly intensified over the course of the last decade. 54 As recently as January 2012, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Raúl Castro during a Latin American tour which U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida aptly called a “tour of tyrants.”55
Thousands of job applicants come to FBI offices all across the country every year, eager to work for the top law enforcement agency in the U.S. But many of them have their hopes dashed, and it’s not because of their work experience or education or criminal records. They’re turned down because they’ve failed their polygraph tests. The FBI’s policy of barring job candidates who fail their polygraph tests clashes with the view of many scientists that government agencies shouldn’t be relying on polygraph testing to decide whether to hire or fire someone. Experts say polygraph testing isn’t a reliable indicator of whether someone is lying – especially in employment screening. Further, a little-known technical glitch in one of the leading polygraphs that the bureau and many other government agencies have used could give applicants who fail polygraphs even more reason to assert that they were inaccurately and unfairly labeled liars. “I was called a lazy, lying, drug dealing junkie by a man who doesn’t know me , my stellar background or my societal contributions,” wrote one black applicant in Baltimore, who said he was told he qualified for a job except for his polygraph test failure. “Just because I am young and black does not automatically denote that I have ever used any illegal drugs.” Government agencies use polygraph testing not only to weed out job applicants but also to question criminal suspects and to determine whether sex offenders are complying with psychological treatment or probation. Although all polygraph testing is controversial, many scientists are highly critical of its use in job screening, saying it’s especially prone to inaccuracies because the questions are often more vague than they are in criminal investigations and therefore they’re more likely to provoke reactions from the innocent that might seem like deception. Adding to the skepticism, polygraphers have documented problems with the measurement of sweat by the LX4000, a polygraph that the FBI and many other federal agencies and police departments across the country have used, McClatchy found. Polygraphers also interpret measurements of respiration and blood pressure for their decisions on whether someone is lying, but many see the sweat measurement as especially indicative of deception. The manufacturer of the LX4000, Lafayette Instrument Co. Inc., describes the problem as rare but it isn’t able to specify what that means. The company also points out that other polygraphs that use the same technology might have the problem as well. “The potential for occasional differences to be observed was already clearly described in the published literature, not limited to the Lafayette polygraph system, and anecdotal experience confirms it is an occasional occurrence,” the company said in a statement to McClatchy. But Gene Iredale, a San Diego lawyer, said the problem could mean that agencies such as the FBI are “making decisions in criminal cases and are taking away security clearances on the basis of completely inaccurate information. The polygraph is speculative to begin with; that’s why it’s not admissible in court.” A spokeswoman said the bureau, which has polygraphed applicants since 1994, “continues to find it a relevant and necessary tool in both employment and operational related matters.” The spokeswoman, Kathleen Wright, said the bureau wouldn’t respond to questions about the LX4000 nor reveal the number of people who failed each year, although she acknowledged that if an applicant doesn’t pass a polygraph “then the applicant is normally not hired.” Records obtained by McClatchy show the FBI polygraphs about13,000 people a year for job screening, criminal investigations and national security inquiries. According to records, the bureau has at least a 30 percent failure rate in its job screening. As many as 40 percent of special agent applicants don’t get the job because of their polygraph test results.
There are at least three ways in which we can illustrate China‘s new custodial functions in buttressing the global economic system in ways that are currently unmatched by any other state. The first concerns Beijing‘s purchase of Euro bonds held by Greek, Italian, Irish and Spanish governments, intended to help avert a default on their debt during Europe‘s financial crisis. 103 China clearly benefitted from these purchases, maintaining the Euro‘s value of China‘s European portfolio.104 The average value of the Euro actually rose against the dollar in the first half of 2011, from $1.33 per Euro to $1.44 and oscillated in that range into early 2013. Beijing used the opportunity to negotiate several important trade agreements and to consolidate major bilateral ties across a broad range of issues. On a trip to Germany in June of 2011, for example, Prime Minister Wen Jiaboa signed an agreement with Chancellor Angela Merkel, ―to establish special government consultations, which means representatives of the two countries will meet regularly and will discuss a wide range of topics, like trade, investment, education, environment, human rights, security and the rule of law.‖ Simultaneously, trade agreements were signed as the Chinese sought to consolidate their exports to and investments in Germany. Prime Minister Wen used his country‘s new leverage to voice complaints about Germany‘s decision to meet the Dalai Lama and to preempt German complaints about copying infringement and the theft of intellectual property. He called for ―respect for China‘s system and China‘s territorial integrity.‖105 There is evidence that Chinese support of Portugal and Spain was also partly motivated by access to those economies could provide to markets and investments in Latin America.106 As, Nicholas Zhu, a former World Bank economist commented, ―It‘s a clear pattern of China‘s intention to help stabilize the euro area. . . The benefit to China is that it will help in the perception of host countries if China is viewed as a responsible stakeholder in the global community‖.107 101 Ramo, The Beijing Consensus, China now regularly links its financial support to broader economic and political issues. In early 2011, for example, Wang Qishan, the Chinese vice-premier, met with EU officials in Beijing during the third annual China-EU High Level Economic and Trade Dialogue and pledged that China would, if necessary, purchase European sovereign bonds. Qishan asked the EU to grant China ―market economy‖ status and lift a long-standing arms embargo. The former had been a long-term goal of China in its efforts to avoid anti-dumping claims by European producers and governments.108 The EU had consistently refused to recognize China as a market economy, but Prime Minister Merkel, with strikingly interesting timing, announced that Germany would actively push for China‘s recognition as a market economy within the EU.109 The second example of China‘s new custodial role concerns its efforts to institute domestic reforms intended to help redress global economic imbalances.110 Until the end of the 1960s, when the dollar was the world‘s undisputed reserve currency, the US current account balance ran at zero or a small surplus. That position dramatically eroded in the 1980s, the US current account deficit peaking at 6% in 2006, just before the financial crisis.111 This shift was symptomatic of a far larger problem. In aggregate, average global imbalances grew by 1% between 1970 and 1990. Between 1990 and 2007, they accelerated by a yearly average of 11%.112 More troubling still, account imbalances became concentrated in specific regions, specifically the United States, East Asia and in what subsequently became the Eurozone. The average regional imbalance as a share of regional GDP increased about 2.6% in the United States and East Asia, and by 1.7% in the Eurozone, compared to 1.1% in the rest of the world. This growing distortion in balances between China, Europe and the US on the one hand, and those involving the rest of the world on the other, led to a greater policy focus on China and the United States in the aftermath of the Great Recession.113 Fundamental to this problem has been the US‘ unprecedented levels of government, private and corporate debt, coupled with low savings rates and declining exports. This behavior stands in stark to their Chinese counterparts.114 High Asian savings rates have been the result of several reinforcing conditions that promote what is known as precautionary savings: the high cost of housing, the lack of a social safety to assist the ill and elderly, low fertility rates and the high cost of education. Galloping Chinese exports that made extra cash available and traditionally low rates of personal consumption in China, where the virtues of ―deferred gratification‖ are deeply ingrained, accelerated the difference between the US and China.115 Chinese private consumption rates as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product
This interpretation assumes that nuclear war would be the big whoosh—a flash of global cataclysm in which everything disappears instantly and painlessly. The lure of instantaneous extinction is pervasive in symbolic perceptions of the Bomb. Even a highly respected social scientist. Stanley Diamond, could say: “If the war should occur, the country will simply disappear some sunny day, while most of us are going about our apathetic business.”” Of course, there is little likelihood that the end would be so simple for everyone. As George Wald put it: “You think, Bang! and the next morning, if you’re still there, you read in the newspapers that 50 million people were killed. But that isn’t the way it happens.” Referring to Hiroshima and Nagasaki victims, he went on to say: “A lot of them took a long time to die ... millions of helpless, maimed, tortured and doomed survivors.’ ‘ Yet once again we must turn aside from the empirical realities to examine the reality of symbolism. And the common perception of both suicide and nuclear war, among those whose common sense can not accept the myth of heroic survival, is likely to be the myth of the big whoosh. Suicide seen as total extinction is the analogue on the individual level to the religious return to primal chaos in myth and ritual, as well as to the nuclear big whoosh. “The ordinary forms of suicide must stand as prototypes of acute generalized total self-destruction.”’ But our survey of theories of suicide corroborates our previous discussions of the appeal of voluntary annihilation: while the negative hope of escaping pain is a motivating factor, it is not nearly as significant as we might think Rather, the appeal of extinction, even without an expectation of rebirth, is fundamentally positive. The common thread here has been recognized more readily by artists than psychologists. Leonardo da Vinci viewed the impulse to suicide as “the hope and desire of going back to primal chaos, like that of the moth lo the light. , . this longing which in its quintessence Is the spirit of the elements .. , and inherent in Nature,”” Similarly, for Herman Hesse, suicides are those persons who “find the aim of life not in perfecting and molding of the self, but in liberating themselves by going back to the mother, back to God, back to the all, . . . They see death and not life as the releaser. They are ready to cast themselves away in surrender, to be extinguished and go back to the beginning.” From this point of view, suicides are drawn to intensify rather than oppose their situation—to take the apparently irreversible situation of anomie and make a virtue of its necessity by carrying it to its ultimate conclusion in perfect chaos. ‘The satisfaction in doing so comes from much more than yielding to powerlessness and escaping pain. In the fantasied big whoosh of suicide all the many faceted attractions of transcending structure and dissolving in the limitless combine, luring the suicide to one final act of merger with the “all.” Yet suicide offers more, for it holds out the promise of control; the suicide consciously creates, and thus gains power over, the primal chaos, death, arid the infinite. Similarly, the Bomb offers the hope of one last moment of cosmic empowerment in the instant of global extinction. And it allows a suicide that is universally shared and consonant with the dominant values and worldview of our culture. Again we find that nuclear weapons offer themselves as the most appealing solution to the very problems they have created, having led us to equate death with utter annihilation—having made us feel “dead in life”—they urge us to transcend this state. But transcendence turns out to mean the suicide of nuclear annihilation, “the only form of transcendence worthy of the age.” Therefore, the vast majority of us do not seek out empirical knowledge of what nuclear war might be; in fact, we avoid such knowledge. It is much more appealing to rest content with the myth of the big whoosh, the one cosmic mushroom cloud in which all reality is instantly returned to the primordial chaos. Phrases such as “the end of civilization,” “the end of human life,” or even “the destruction of the planet” roll off our tongues easily. Is this not because we are in awe of such a possibility, fascinated as well as terrified, in the same way that we are drawn and simultaneously repelled by our own self-annihilation through transcendence? At a time in which most other avenues of transcendence seem blocked to us, are we willing to contemplate one great instant of permanent, self-induced transcendence? To flow up into the great mushroom cloud; to be filled with the unbelievable power of the atom; to explode the oppressive structures within us and around us; to take the final plunge, along with all humanity, into a cosmic unity; to return to the source from which all began. These are the deeply buried symbolic images that seduce us into following the Bomb, our modern God, down the path to the martyrdom of mutual suicide.
But now, major players are planning to revive the technology. Two years ago, the US Navy awarded defence group Lockheed Martin an $8m (£5m) contract to develop critical OTEC components and to mature its design for a pilot plant. Since then, the navy has awarded a further $4m to build on its research. The hope is that OTEC will provide a consistent energy source for naval bases. ’Some of the large bases, such as Pearl Harbour, are ideal locations,’ said Robert Varley, OTEC project manager at Lockheed Martin. ’Our fiscal-year defence programme has a separate area specifically to develop OTEC. That will be a signal to industry that the navy is serious about going forward with the technology. Of course, congress has to approve it, but I think the chances are good.’
Many large American shipping lines like the American President Lines are leaving U.S. flags and are becoming FOC ships. In 1998 there were 28 open register countries of FOC ships and 19,270 vessels over 100 GT, which comes to 22.5% of the world's fleet and in that year there was a 8.5% increases in FOC ships. Of the top 35 maritime countries based on real ownership of vessels not one of them is an open register country. For example, the true nationality of ownership of ships from Greece that are part of open register fleets (percentage of open register fleets) are as follows: Liberia 12.4%, Panama 11.1 %, Cyprus 72.6%, Bahamas 19.0% and Malta 56.3%. Of the top six fleets of gross tonnage in 1998, five of them are open registers for FOC ships; Panama (6,188 vessels), Liberia (1,697 vessels), Bahamas (1,221 vessels), Cyprus (1,650) and Malta (1,378). The U.S. fleet ranks 11th in gross tonnage. Of the top six fastest growing fleets in percentage of gross tonnage, includes four other open registers of FOC ships; Cayman Islands, Cambodia, Belize, and Antigua/Barbuda. This comes to 51.3% of the world's gross tonnage carried on FOC ships. Each year the numbers above keep growing at an alarming rate. The reason for this is that there is greater profit in sailing FOC ships for the ship-owners. The following are the reasons for this: Easy entry to and exit from open registers; low taxes or no taxes levied on shipping; the governments of open registered countries lack the power or willingness to impose national or international standards which allows FOC ships to avoid health, safety, environmental and ship maintenance regulations; avoid union ship crews; hire ship crews from the most economically depressed nations; helps suppress ship crews grievances; and in some cases allows for true ship-owners to avoid economic responsibility for such things as environmental damage, shipping accidents, and payment of ship crew's wages.
Now that President Bush has built on this foundation, he should use the new strategic partnership to move beyond crisis management between India and Pakistan to try to help the two countries resolve the underlying issue that has brought them repeatedly to conflict: Kashmir. America has avoided dealing with the Kashmir issue for decades, both because of its complexities and because India opposed outside involvement, preferring to deal bilaterally with Pakistan. This approach has not worked; the problem has gotten worse and has repeatedly taken the subcontinent to the brink of disaster. Now is the time for quiet   American diplomacy to exploit our stronger ties with India and our improved relations with Pakistan since 9/11 to try to resolve the Kashmir quarrel. It is in the self interest of all three nations to do so. The timing is particularly fortuitous since India and Pakistan have begun their own bilateral dialogue to improve relations since they were last at the brink of war in 2003. That dialogue has already produced some modest confidence-building measures in Kashmir but has not really engaged the underlying issues.
Putting a price on carbon is essential for success in the international response to climate change, said participants in a COP21 side event. Without a price, recognizing and charging for the damaging effects of emitting greenhouse gases, efforts to address climate change will be inefficient and likely too slow to avoid its worst effects. Pricing carbon is “not the only thing, but a necessary thing,” said Rachel Kyte, Special Envoy for Climate Change, World Bank Group. “We have to take carbon pollution out of our growth model,” she said. That entails “energy policy reform, energy subsidy reform and putting a price on carbon.” China has seven pilot emissions trading systems, and has announced its intention to launch a national system in 2017. Qimin Chai, a deputy director in China’s National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, said it is key to “count the benefits and the costs” of action on climate change, explaining how emissions trading systems can spur development and stimulate economies through recycling of investment, if the price is high enough. Countries and constituencies need to “make pricing integral, and build on it,” explained David Heurtel, the Development, Environment and Climate Change Minister in the province of Québec, Canada. Québec launched an emissions cap and trade system in 2013 and linked it with the emissions trading system in California, U.S.A., a year later. The Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba have since announced their intentions to cap and trade their emissions. One province, British Columbia, has had a carbon tax for several years, and another province, Alberta, is planning one. Québec started with a low carbon dioxide price per tonne, which has steadily risen. The gradual transition has worked well, avoiding economic dampening. Business has integrated the cost and the province has reinvested the income, explained Mr. Heurtel. Bruno Lafont, Co-Chair of the LafargeHolcim cement company, said he was in favour of global carbon pricing, stressing the word global. With some constituencies subject to a price and others not, competition could be uneven. Businesses need “stability and predictability” and any pricing system needs to avoid “distortion of competition,” Mr. Lafont said.
In the post-Cold War era, China and Russia developed their relationship with a shared interest in resisting pressure from Washington and countering the US effort to create a unipolar world. As early as 1996, Beijing and Moscow decided to forge a ‘strategic consultative partnership’.28 For Beijing, Sino-Russian relations affect not only the security of China's neighbourhood regions, but also the global and regional balance of power. In recent years, to offset the perceived strategic pressure issuing from the US rebalancing strategy, China has moved to further strengthen its ties with Russia. In March 2013, Xi chose Russia as the first country to visit after he assumed the Chinese presidency, signalling the significance he attached to relations with Moscow. The outbreak of the Ukraine crisis in early 2014 pushed Russia's President Putin towards building closer ties with China as a way of resisting pressure from the West. In May 2014, when Putin came to China to attend the fourth summit meeting of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), he and President Xi signed the China–Russia Joint Statement on a New Stage of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Coordination, which expressed their joint willingness to expand and deepen bilateral cooperation in various areas. They also witnessed the signature of several key documents promising a broad range of measures of economic cooperation in fields including energy, electricity, aviation, communication and local government cooperation. The single most significant achievement to emerge from Putin's first trip to China after the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis is a 30-year deal for the supply of Russian natural gas to China. Talks about this deal had been going on for about ten years and had repeatedly stalled over pricing issues. The ultimate conclusion of this agreement is therefore regarded as a marker of strategic progress in Sino-Russian relations. Indeed, both the US rebalancing strategy and the Ukraine crisis have prompted China and Russia to deepen and substantiate their ‘strategic consultative partnership’.29 Looking into the future, Beijing and Moscow will probably continue to strengthen their ties in the political, economic, security, energy and other fields as both are confronted with pressure from Washington.30
To a disturbing extent, whaling opponents have relied on colonialist or even racist arguments to develop opposition to the Makah whale hunt. These arguments follow themes that have existed since colonial times to maintain unequal power relationships between native and non-native peoples. Colonialism is not the immediate goal of anti-whaling organizations, and such arguments do not invalidate the other points raised by whaling opponents. As well, the actions and rhetoric of a few individuals and organizations cannot represent the beliefs and attitudes of an entire movement. However, I raise these arguments for criticism because I have not in my research come across a condemnation of the use of such colonialist arguments by whaling opponents, or even an indication that these arguments will not be used in the future.Native American political activity must be “incited” by outsiders because they cannot act by themselves. Whaling opponents such as the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society have frequently suggested that the Japanese are responsible for the Makah whale hunt. The only Japanese involvement in west coast whaling has been a $20,000 start-up grant for a Nuu-chah-nulth whaling organization, the World Council of Whalers. The Makah are not members of this organization. Ben Johnson (Makah Tribal Council) has said that “Japan wanted to give us money, to help us buy boats, to show us how to kill the whales, everything….We said no because we knew it would be very controversial, and we want to do everything by the book.” However, this lack of involvement has not stopped Sea Shepherd’s Paul Watson from explaining:¶ The truth is that it is not the Makah who are our enemy. We were in Neah Bay to oppose the Japanese and the Norwegians, who manipulated the Makah into this situation. Sometimes strategy means having to fight an elusive enemy that takes on another guise in order to benefit the primary opposition. In this case, the Makah are pawns in a global Japanese chess game.¶ Watson has not even accorded the Makah the status of co-conspirators in his chess match, instead drawing directly on an image of the Makah as a passive people easily manipulated by non-natives. This contradicts the statements of many Makah people, including Makah opponents of the hunt, about the importance of whaling and the reasons the Makah desire to hunt.¶ Native American society can be reduced to a conflict between “tradition” and “assimilation.”  Whaling opponents have extended their arguments about subsistence versus commercial whaling by speaking of a division between the Makah into “traditional” and “assimilated” camps. They suggest that Makah traditionalists oppose the hunt as something non-traditional, while the tribal council reputedly wants the hunt only for its economic potential. The Progressive Animal Welfare Society writes that “though the tribe is divided over whaling, pro-whalers are in control of the tribal government. Opposition to whaling includes tribal elders.” Strictly speaking, this is true, but the failure to note that elders also support the hunt clearly intends to feed into romantic stereotypes about “traditional” versus “assimilated” Indians. Non-natives know better than Native Americans what counts as “authentic” Indian culture. Whaling opponents have also opposed the hunt by suggesting that Makah cultural aspirations are “inauthentic,” usually in the process of telling the Makah what their culture was, is or ought to be. “I really doubt that [the Makah’s] ancestors would respect this modern day version of whale hunting,” one woman writes. She continues:¶ It is my understanding that native americans [sic] in the past have always taken (killed) animals…Only [sic] as needed for survival and then in great respect and deep appreciation of the animal. This wanton act of killing certainly does not seem to be motivated by survival, respect for all of earth’s life forms, nor spirituality.¶ This kind of romantic condemnation has been common historically in colonialist discourse about Native Americans. This opponent of the Makah hunt dismisses what the Makah say about themselves and their own experiences as if she possessed superior knowledge about the values and motivations of Native Americans.¶ Technological change is cultural assimilation. Another favorite theme among animal rights activists is the assumption that technological change demonstrates the cultural assimilation of indigenous peoples. Speaking of the Makah, one whale tour operator writes:¶ If they are so hell bent on going back to their roots, why the hell do they insist on: driving cars, using internal combustion engines, fibreglass, aluminum, roads, shopping centres, all the other stuff that has improved their lives since the coming of the “White Man.”¶ Few people would confuse Americans and Japanese just because we share a fondness for Sony Playstations, yet the Makah are told their modernity “proves” they are no longer “authentically” Makah. More importantly, the Makah have a right to perpetuate their culture, adapting it to meet new needs. The Makah should not have to choose between putting their culture under glass, or abandoning it entirely in order to participate in American society and the world economy. If Native Americans disagree with non-natives, it is because they are barbaric. Whaling opponents often explain that the Makah must accept the “progress” and “evolution” of society. By this they mean the Makah must accept the forced end of whaling as the “natural” outcome of “social evolution” along with fibreglass and shopping centers. Sea Shepherd explains:¶ A society can never evolve by adopting archaic or inhumane rituals. Progress affects everyone living in this new era of the Global Village. No legitimate argument can be made that the Makah, or any other ethnic group, can move their culture forward through ritual killing.¶ This argument would be quite familiar to nineteenth century Americans, or to the European colonizers of any continent. It is exactly the same argument made under the banners of Manifest Destiny, assimilation policies, white supremacy and social Darwinism. Non-natives set a standard for cultural behavior in these arguments that only a small fraction of westerners follow (one estimate of vegetarians in the US places them at 12 million out of 248 million Americans). To lecture the Makah on ritual killing, while our society thinks nothing of killing chickens, cattle and pigs (with all the ritual precision of factory farms) seems hypocritical. Keith Johnson, President of the Makah Whaling Commission, calls this “moral elitism.”¶ In short, whaling opponents frequently make colonialist arguments that delegitimize the Makah’s right to whale by comparing the Makah unfavorably to an ahistorical and idealized portrait of Native Americans. Many non-natives appreciate in vague terms that Native Americans were “in harmony” with their environment. With our concern to create a environmentally sound culture and society, Native Americans form a ready target for the projection of our fears and fantasies. Just as long, of course, as real Native Americans with real needs do not intrude on these representations. Then an elaborate arsenal of colonialist arguments can be raised to suggest that it is not our own stereotypes but modern Native Americans who are wrong. Whatever one believes about the morality of whale hunting, these arguments are themselves an injustice to the Makah.
Outmatched by the West in direct cyber confrontation yet eager to maintain the global connectivity supporting economic growth, China (together with Russia and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization) advocates for internet governance reform. These changes, predicated on so-called internet sovereignty, would replace the current multistakeholder system and its liberal The Chinese military is rigidly hierarchical and has no wartime experience with complex information systems. SUMMER 2015 19 norms of internet openness with a formal international regulator, such as the United Nations’ International Telecommunication Union, and strong norms of noninterference with sovereign networks. Chinese complaints of US internet hegemony are not completely unfounded: the internet reinforces US dominance, but it does so through a light regulatory touch that relies on the self-interest of stakeholders—academic scientists, commercial engineers, government representatives, and civil society organizations. The internet expands in a self-organized fashion because adopters have incentives to pursue increasing returns to interconnection. The profit-driven expansion of networks and markets through more reliable and voluminous transactions and more innovative products (e.g., cloud services, mobile computing, and embedded computing) tends to reinforce the economic competitiveness of the US and its leading information technology firms. Many Western observers fear that cyber reform based on the principle of internet sovereignty might legitimize authoritarian control and undermine the cosmopolitan promise of the multistakeholder system. China, however, benefits too much from the current system to pose a credible alternative. Tussles around internet governance are more likely to result in minor change at the margins of the existing system, not a major reorganization that shifts technical protocols and operational regulation to the United Nations.
Furthermore, Congress is infinitely more likely to approve funding for R&D; and infrastructure if the projects are military-related. Which is depressing, but true -- the one thing that no politician can get caught opposing is the safety of American troops. In fact, the whole premise of the article is rather depressing, on point though it may be: The only way we may end up getting a competitive clean energy industry is through serious military investment, which is of course, serious government spending. Which under any other guise would be vehemently opposed by conservatives.
IV. Pragmatism Alongside the deep and powerful Fatalism model, informants applied an understanding that current immigration problems can be addressed and improved by taking a problemsolving approach and pragmatically putting differences aside to come up with real solutions to immigration issues. As with the Us and Them con=licting models, this sense of Pragmatism was expressed by the same informants who, at other points in their interviews, employed Fatalism models. Employing the Pragmatism model, informants understood the immigration system as one that serves a vital function for the country. Moreover, they viewed this system as something which could and should be improved through a “step by step” process focused on solving current problems. This deep understanding of the importance and power of “rolling up our sleeves” to solve problems is a foundational model which FrameWorks research has found Americans can apply in thinking about a range of social issues.15 This deep foundational model was composed of two more-speci=ic understandings. 1. The Economic Fit model. Informants shared the implicit understanding that the government can, and should, use the immigration system to maintain a functional balance between the size of the U.S. population and the number of jobs available. Using this assumption, informants adopted a pragmatic perspective on the immigration system — seeing the system as one that serves a purpose and can, and should, be changed to better achieve its important function. The key difference between this model and the Fatalism models described above is that, in the Economic Fit model, the system can (and should) be improved, and reform is understood as necessary. Interviewer: What do you think about when you think about reforming or changing the immigration system? Informant: If you’re letting X number of people in, in all fairness, you need to be able to have opportunities for employment for all those people. The system needs to achieve this balance.
President Obama’s surprise announcement that he will ask Congress for approval of a military attack on Syria is being hailed as a vindication of the rule of law and a revival of the central role of Congress in war-making, even by critics. But all of this is wrong. Far from breaking new legal ground, President Obama has reaffirmed the primacy of the executive in matters of war and peace. The war powers of the presidency remain as mighty as ever.
Some analysts, including Robinson (2008), Petras (2007), Arnson (2007), and Birns and James (2002), are rightly sceptical of the possibilities for change in the region, despite the emergence of ‘New Social Movements’ (see below) and governments willing to question mainstream ‘fundamentals’ or even, as in the case of Venezuela, reject the whole neo-liberal doctrine. They believe that while these ‘Pink Tide’ governments have become very visible and prompted much speculation about change in Latin America, in practice they have done little to challenge the dominant order. It may also be argued that the leaders of the ‘Pink Tide’, such as Lula in Brazil, Kirchner in Argentina, Ortega in Nicaragua and others, are potential recruits for a new modified form of neo-liberalism as proposed by reformist globalisers. In a series of articles, Paul Cammack (2002a, 2002b, 2003, 2004) has analysed what he terms ‘the Wolfensohn-Stiglitz project’, which he claims is designed to ‘operationalise’ a blueprint for global neo-liberal political economy that incorporates ‘a new politics of development’ (2002a:178). Indeed, rather like the Labour Party in the UK, the use of a ‘soft left’ option to repackage the neo-liberal agenda, and disarm and undermine potentially radical forces, is a well-tried formula. In Brazil, for instance, despite some radical posturing by Lula, inequality has increased during the period he has been in office. Globally, in 2005 the wealthy grew by 6.5 per cent and in Latin America by 9.5 per cent, but in Brazil this group grew by 11.3 per cent (Merrill Lynch & Capgemini 2006). While sections of the reformist ‘Pink Tide’ may be falling in line with the kind of policy shift envisaged by the World Bank, which, in the case of Mexico, Cammack (2002a:178) believes has ‘succeeded brilliantly’, the more radical leaders like Chávez in Venezuela, Morales in Bolivia and Correa in Ecuador imagine an alternative programme that is in direct opposition to the Bank’s vision of neo-liberal adjustment and the strictures of the IMF. The policies of these governments also seem to be more responsive to, and in tune with, popular demands in the region. This process is being articulated through the Bolivarian Alternative for Latin Americaand the Caribbean (ALBA), which seeks continental co-operation to resolve problems of poverty and inequality, a topic that will be addressed later in this chapter.
In the last fifteen years, Mexico's middle has blossomed. An open and diversifying economy, expanding home ownership and credit, new schools, new products, and new opportunities have all worked in its favor. Yet despite its successes, the economic center remains quite fragile. Serious obstacles threaten its growth and stability. The next challenge is to find ways to con­solidate and broaden this middle class, to build picket fences from Nuevo Laredo to San Cristobal.
The Venezuelan President loves China and is very impressed by Big Sister’s economic development. He lauds the Asian giant as being “the greatest motor that exists to drive the world beyond the crisis of capitalism. Nobody can doubt that the center of gravity of the world has been moved towards Beijing".¶ Hugo Chávez also wishes for ALBA member states to get more involved with Big Sister, encouraging them regularly at ALBA summits to “form a united front” of Latin America with China.¶ Sino-Venezuelan energy cooperation reaches even further than oil. China is helping Venezuela to develop its electricity grid by increasing hydro- and thermo-electricity production.¶ The Chinese Sinohydro Corporation and the Venezuelan state electricity company CORPOELEC cooperate in order to augment Venezuela’s hydro-electricity output.¶ Furthermore, Chinese specialists give Venezuela technical assistance and technology transfer to boost thermo-electricity production. A thermo-electric plant of 500 megawatts capacity has already been installed in the state of Mérida, three more plants with a capacity of 300 megawatts each are envisaged in the country’s north and east.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Congress on Tuesday to push for passage of a revised North American trade agreement.
The North Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea is an important maritime domain that directly affects U.S. security and economic interests. Cuba, for example, is located only 90 miles away from Florida. As Cuba moves to develop its offshore oil and natural gas resources, it has reportedly signed contracts with oil companies from Brazil, India, Italy, Russia and Spain, and is negotiating with Chinese oil companies for leasing rights in its coastal waters. This could create additional diplomatic challenges for the United States if drilling occurs along the U.S. continental shelf. 31 As more oil companies – including national oil companies – begin to operate off the U.S. coast to exploit Cuba’s offshore oil and natural gas reserves, ratifying LOSC will strengthen the ability of the United States to challenge claims to resources that may overlap with U.S. reserves in its continental shelf by adjudicating those claims in the convention’s legal bodies. The likelihood of this challenge manifesting is far from remote, and the United States must be prepared to secure its interests.
Since the downturn of the late 2000s, the U.S. economy has rebounded at a steady rate, garnering praise from numerous economists as well. In fact, Moody’s Analytics officials have described the nation’s ongoing economic growth as “resilient,” a positive sign for the country and its residents.
Finally, and most importantly for our present concerns, the third point articulated by Galison and Jones concerns what we have referred to as the pragmatic consequences of the disaster imagery—or perhaps better to say, of the disaster-as-image. Insofar as a major environmental disaster such as the Gulf oil spill is perceived and comprehended through visual images, the response to the disaster will also be determined largely according to a rhetoric of images. (“Response” here is meant to include governmental and industry policy changes as well as individual citizens‘ understanding of the need for “lifestyle” changes; the concept of “pragmatic implications,” accordingly, would include both of these dimensions, collective and individual.) Observing that politicians and the public were equally ready to declare the spill “over” as their perception of the disaster-as-image was successfully resolved, Galison and Jones imply that the visual images effectively shape the response that we make, as a society and as individuals. That is to say, our response is largely an effect of the visual imagery that conveys the reality of the disaster, the media spectacle that doubles up the empirical event projected into the dimension of cyberspace. This dimension—event as information—constitutes the determining level of reality for our age of information. Also implied by this last point is the claim (made explicit later in the article) that important aspects of the oil spill which are not easily visualized by existing technologies, and thus are left “out of the picture” of the disaster that shapes public opinion and political response, might significantly alter that opinion and response. If policy makers and the public were adequately informed about these not-yet-visualized aspects, we may assume, our response would be very different: we might not, for example, be so ready to declare the spill over as soon as the oil slicks are effectively removed from the visible surfaces of the ocean. This counterfactual scenario could be realized—if only “our awesome technologies of the image” (Galison and Jones 2010, 51) allowed us to visualize the underwater plumes of oil, dispersed from the visible surface and rendered invisible to satellite cameras. The authors seem to suggest that it is due to certain technological limits or lacunae that the picture of disaster formed and disseminated via visual images is necessarily incomplete—and thus subject to distortion or manipulation: “That we have yet to develop or popularize certain kinds of technologies of vision (for deep ocean plumes, for durational models of wetland change, or for the microscopic uptake of petro-dispersants inside organisms) produces specific invisibilities that fit well with corporate policy. No picture, no action.” (Galison and Jones 2010, 49)
In order to try to show that the U.S. Navy is insufficient in the face of future threats, Kaplan argues that we on are our way to “a 150 ship navy” that will be overwhelmed by the demands of warfighting and global economic maintenance. He suggests that the “1,000 Ship Navy” proposal, an international plan to streamline cooperation between the world’s navies on maritime maintenance issues such as piracy, interdiction of drug and human smuggling, and disaster relief, is an effort at “elegant decline,” and declares that the dominance of the United States Navy cannot be maintained through collaboration with others.¶ It’s true that a 600 ship navy can do more than the current 250-plus ship force of the current U.S. Navy, but Kaplan’s playing a game of bait and switch. The Navy has fewer ships than it did two decades ago, but the ships it has are far more capable than those of the 1980s. Because of the collapse of its competitors, the Navy is relatively more capable of fighting and winning wars now than it was during the Reagan administration. Broadly speaking, navies have two missions; warfighting, and maritime maintenance. Kaplan wants to confuse the maritime maintenance mission (which can be done in collaboration with others) with the warfighting mission (which need not be). A navy can require the cooperation of others for the maintenance mission, while still possessing utter military superiority over any one navy or any plausible combination of navies on the high seas.¶ Indeed, this is the situation that the United States Navy currently enjoys. It cannot be everywhere all at once, and does require the cooperation of regional navies for fighting piracy and smuggling. At the same time, the U.S. Navy can destroy any (and probably all, at the same time) naval challengers. To conflate these two missions is equal parts silly and dishonest. The Navy has arrived at an ideal compromise between the two, keeping its fighting supremacy while leading and facilitating cooperation around the world on maritime issues.
Finally, we come to the great Galtung metaphors of ’structural violence’ and ’positive peace’. They are metaphors rather than models, and for that very reason are suspect. Metaphors always imply models and metaphors have much more persuasive power than models do, for models tend to be the preserve of the specialist. But when a metaphor implies a bad model it can be very dangerous, for it is both persuasive and wrong. The metaphor of structural violence I would argue falls right into this category. The metaphor is that poverty, deprivation, ill health, low expectations of life, a condition in which more than half the human race lives, is ’like’ a thug beating up the victim and taking his money away from him in the street, -or it is ’like’ a conqueror stealing the land of the people and reducing them to slavery. The implication is that poverty and its associated ills are the fault of the thug or the conqueror and the solution is to do away with thugs and conquerors. While there is some truth in the metaphor, in the modem world at least there is not very much. Violence, whether of the streets and the home, or of the guerilla, of the police, or of the armed forces, is a very different phenomenon from poverty. The processes which create and sustain poverty are not at all like the processes which create and sustain violence, although like everything else in the world, everything is somewhat related to everything else. There is a very real problem of the structures which lead to violence, but unfortunately Galtung’s metaphor of structural violence as he has used it has diverted attention from this problem. Violence in the behavioral sense, that is, somebody actually doing damage to somebody else and trying to make them worse off, is a ’threshold’ phenomenon, rather like the boiling over of a pot. The temperature under a pot can rise for a long time without its boiling over, but at some threshold boiling over will take place. The study of the structures which underlie violence are a very important and much neglected part of peace research and indeed of social science in general. Threshold phenomena like violence are difficult to study because they represent ’breaks’ in the system rather than uniformities. Violence, whether between persons or organizations, occurs when the ’strain’ on a system is too great for its ‘~s~trength’. The metaphor here is that violence is like what happens when we break a piece of chalk. Strength and strain, however, especially in social systems, are so interwoven historically that it is very difficult to separate them. The diminution of violence involves two possible strategies, or a mixture of the two; one is the increase in the strength of the system, ~the other is the diminution of the strain. The strength of systems involves habit, culture, taboos, and sanctions, all these things, which enable a system to stand Increasing strain without breaking down into violence. The strains on the system are largely dynamic in character, such as arms races, mutually stimulated hostility, changes in relative economic position or political power, which are often hard to identify. Conflict of interest are only part of the strain on a system, and not always the most important part. It is very hard for people to know their interests, and misperceptions of interests take place mainly through the dynamic processes, not through the structural ones. It is only perceptions of interest which affect people’s behavior, not the ’real’ interests, whatever these may be, and the gap between perception and reality can be very large and resistant to change. However, what Galitung calls structural violence (which has been defined by one unkind commentator as anything that Galltung doesn’~t like) was originally defined as any unnecessarily low expectation of life, an that assumption that anybody who dies before the allotted span has been killed, however unintentionally and unknowingly, by somebody else. The concept has been expanded to include all the problems off poverty, destitution, deprivation, and misery. These are enormously real and are a very high priority for research and action, but they belong to systems which are only peripherally related to the structures which, produce violence. This is not to say that the cultures of violence and the cultures of poverty are not sometimes related, though not all poverty cultures are culture of violence, and certainly not all cultures of violence are poverty cultures. But the dynamics of poverty and the success or failure to rise out off ’it are of a complexity far beyond anything which the metaphor of structural violence can offer. While the metaphor of structural violence performed a ’service in calling attention to a problem, it may have done a disservice in preventing us from finding the answer.
Treasury Department officials called bond traders and their advisers on Friday to assure them that the Trump administration isn’t considering prioritizing U.S. debt payments if Congress fails to increase the nation’s borrowing authority later this year, according to two people familiar with the matter. The calls came after Bloomberg News published a story about worries among traders that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin may have to employ a secret plan written by the Obama administration to make sure debt payments are made, potentially at the expense of salaries for government employees, payments to contractors and other obligations. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts the federal government will hit its debt ceiling some time in October. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has urged Congress to increase the nation’s borrowing authority without brinkmanship, as in 2011 when a political showdown triggered the first downgrade of U.S. debt. That year, the Treasury and Federal Reserve developed a secret contingency plan to prioritize payments on government securities over other obligations in case Congress didn’t act in time. The plan was publicly revealed in January.While some conservative Republicans have pointed to debt-payment prioritization as an option for Treasury, perhaps even a preferred one, some financial market participants may regard it as the equivalent of a first-ever default on the national debt. Anxiety among traders is gradually increasing as Congress shows no sign of grappling with the issue. Citigroup Inc. has said prioritizing debt payments would be a “dangerous precedent,” and Wrightson ICAP LLC’s Lou Crandall has called it a “truly terrible idea.” Bank of America Corp., and Jefferies LLC have mentioned the option in client notes, saying it’s unlikely
The Horn of Africa is one of the most strategically critical regions in the world with the narrow passage where the Red Sea joins the Indian Ocean, the Bab el-Mandeb, being a potential choke point for much of the worlds commerce. Almost all of the trade between the European Union and China, Japan, India and the rest of Asia passes through the Bab el-Mandeb everyday. Up to 30% of the worlds oil, including all of the oil and natural gas from the Persian Gulf heading west passes through the Horn of Africa daily. Who controls the Horn of Africa controls a major chunk of the worlds economies and whether you and I understand it, the CIA, MI6 and all the western intelligence agencies know all to well just how critical the Horn of Africa is to their national interests. To make my point, lets say Somalia was a strong, united, independent, well armed Islamic country and in seeing the NATO attack on Libya, declared that no EU or USA bound shipments of cargo, oil or natural gas would be allowed to pass through the Bab el-Mandeb as long as the NATO bombardment of Libya was continuing. How long would the EU economies be able to hold out without the energy supplies from the Persian Gulf or the vital Asian imports? Is it even conceivable that the USA and its NATO allies would allow a scenario such as this to develop? Understanding this is crucial to understanding why the western powers conduct such a criminal policy in the Horn of Africa. The USA, still the world’s lone superpower, has a policy of using local enforcers, policemen on the beat, to do its dirty work in areas of the world of critical importance to its interests. In South America the USA uses Colombia as its local gendarme or strongman to try and keep the region in line. In West Africa the USA uses Nigeria, in the Middle East, Israel and in East Africa the main USA mafioso enforcer is Ethiopia. Every year the USA and its western underlings pour some $7 billion into keeping the Ethiopian regime headed by the former Marxist-Leninist guerilla leader Meles Zenawi afloat making Ethiopia one of the most aid dependent countries in the world and a rival to Israel as the largest recipients of western aid on the planet. For this the USA can order Meles Zenawi to send his army to invade Somalia in the name of the “War on Terror” in 2006. Earlier, in 2000, Ethiopia invaded Eritrea, again at the urging of the USA. Today, the USA is paying the salaries of some 10,000 Ethiopian Army “peacekeepers” deployed around Abeye, the oil producing region on the border between north and South Sudan. For these and other crimes in the service of Pax Americana Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has a permanent “get out of jail free” card, or blanket immunity. He has at least a billion dollars stashed in his mainly London bank accounts for the not so distant day when he boards his final flight out of Addis Ababa. Whether it was former Brit PM Tony Blair anointing Meles Zenawi as chair of the short lived Africa Commission to the Obama White house arranging for Meles to stride the stage of the latest G-20 meeting of world leaders, Ethiopia must appear for all the world to see to have the unqualified backing of the western bankster regimes. With the largest, best equipped army in Africa, including weapons from North Korea, Ethiopia has a job to do and first and foremost it is to make sure that the region surrounding the Bab el-Mandeb choke point remains firmly under western control. For he who controls Bab el-Mandeb has his fingers around the throats of both the EU and Asia’s economies. Today the USA’s grip on the region is increasingly in doubt, for the Ethiopian regime is ever closer to the day of its demise and what comes after Meles Zenawi’s departure could shake the world as we know it. Choke Point Bab el-Mandeb is strategically critical in today’s world and just how important can be judged by how careful the western media is in covering the region. Almost nothing is allowed in the news that might hasten the day of Meles Zenawi’s departure. Meles must stride the G-20 stage once again for all the world to see that he remains the anointed defender of western control of the Bab el-Mandeb and Pax Americana must seem to be firmly in control of one of the most strategically critical maritime passages in the world. The day the USA loses control of the Bab el-Mandeb may very well mark the end of the USA’s days as the worlds lone superpower and it’s control of the world as we know it.
Although many expected the JCPOA to improve U.S.-Iranian ties, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s words, spoken more than a year later, suggest that the Islamic Republic of Iran remains deeply insecure. Khamenei’s statement, taken at face value, suggests a desire to deter the United States. Iran’s effort at aggressive deterrence occurs simultaneously with a U.S. effort to deter Iran. The mutual suspi- cion need not lead to violence. A successful U.S. strategy toward Iran—and a successful Iranian strategy toward the United States—requires an understanding of the factors that animate and motivate Iranian strategic behavior. One simple explanation, often proffered among many of Iran’s neighbors, and increasingly among advisers to the Trump administration, is that Iran is a revisionist power that seeks to undermine Middle Eastern security. Speaking at CSIS in April 2016, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said, “Recognize that Iran is not a nation state, rather, it’s a revolutionary cause devoted to mayhem.”2 Former national security adviser Michael Flynn testified to Congress in June 2015, Iran has not once (not once) contributed to the greater good of the security of the region. Nor has Iran contributed to the protection of security for the people of the region. Instead, and for decades, they have contributed to the severe insecurity and instability of the region, especially the sub-region of the Levant surrounding Israel.3 Speaking to a joint meeting of Congress in 2015, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, Iran and [the Islamic State (ISIS)] are competing for the crown of militant Islam. One calls itself the Islamic Republic. The other calls itself the Islamic State. Both want to impose a militant Islamic empire first on the region and then on the entire world. They just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire. In this deadly game of thrones, there’s no place for America or for Israel, no peace for Christians, Jews, or Muslims who don’t share the Islamist medieval creed, no rights for women, no freedom for anyone.
Despite the conviction of the necessity and safety of vaccinations, there are a number of studies coming forward that illustrate the potential dangers they may pose. A scientific review published by the Department of Paediatric Rehabilitation from the Medical School at the University of Bialystok has determined that there are a number of neurological adverse events that follow vaccination. This research is specific to Polish vaccinations, but is still useful given the fact that many ingredients used and examined in the study are still used in vaccinations all over the world.
The U.S. is still the prevailing influence in Latin America. The geographic proximity of the U.S. to Latin America, as well as the cultural and historic ties of the western hemispheric nations, are just a few of the natural advantages the U.S. has over such relatively distant countries as China. At least economically, it is clear that China still prioritizes its relations with the U.S. over those with Latin America. For instance, in 2007, the U.S. was ranked as China's top trading partner, at $302.1 billion in trade; meanwhile, no Latin American country made China's top ten list (The U.S.-China Business Council 2008). Nor is China's interest in Latin America an exceptional development; rather, it corresponds to China's burgeoning relations in Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Overall, China's increased footprint in Latin America is not indicative of a new rivalry with the U.S. Instead, it more likely reveals the globalizing trend that helps to define modern international relations. China is merely taking advantage of the disintegration of political and spatial boundaries brought on by globalization, in order to expand its own economic and political interests. "... [I]t has demonstrated flexibility in relationships with Latin American regimes on both the right and left of the political spectrum. In addition, [China] has sought to maintain a low profile in Latin America that avoids provoking the United States" (China-Latin America Task Force 2006). Therefore, the U.S. should take a cooperative rather than competitive stance towards China's western advancement in order to minimize any complication of its economic and political interests, as well as capitalize on the opportunities a new hemispheric player can provide. U.S. policymakers would be wise to continue to encourage China to adopt human rights and environmental protections to ensure Beijing's responsible involvement in Latin America. At the same time, the U.S. should recognize China's ability to contribute to an increasingly prosperous western hemisphere which is now seeking autonomy from Washington's sometimes harsh manifestations.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Smart  people in the administration have spent the last two days  telling the American people that U.S. strikes against the Khorasan Group  were necessary to disrupt "imminent attack plotting" against U.S. and Western interests. They warned that members of the shadowy Khorasan Group, an al-Qaida offshoot, were "nearing the execution phase" of an attack in the U.S. or Europe. They spoke of "active plotting that posed an imminent threat."  People may have come away with the impression that the terror group was on the brink of pulling off something awful. Perhaps not. In government-speak, "imminent attack plotting" doesn't necessarily mean an attack is imminent. Careful parsing of the language reveals a distinction between imminent plotting and an imminent attack. Likewise, an imminent threat doesn't necessarily mean an imminent attack. And, in the view of the government, there's more than one meaning for imminent, it turns out. Dictionary.com defines imminent as "likely to occur at any moment." But a Justice Department white paper released in February 2013 gives a more nuanced view. "An 'imminent' threat of violent attack against the United States does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future," the memo reads. That's because U.S. officials say they can't wait until preparations for a terrorist act are completed before they take action to defend U.S. interests. So their idea of taking action against an "imminent threat" involves a more elastic time frame. In the case of the Khorasan Group, two U.S. officials told the AP that U.S. officials aren't aware of the terrorists identifying any particular location or target for an attack in the near future. But intelligence officials have known for months that Khorasan group extremists were scheming with bomb-makers from al-Qaida's Yemen affiliate to find new ways to get explosives onto planes, the officials said. The plans were far enough along that the Transportation Security Administration over the summer banned uncharged mobile phones and laptops from flights to the U.S. that originate in Europe and the Middle East. Despite persistent questioning after the airstrikes, U.S. officials have not explained whether something changed in recent weeks to compel them to launch cruise missiles. Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday on CNN that, although the U.S. had been tracking the group's plots for some time, "the moment actually was ripe," for military strikes. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, described the imminent threat of the al Qaida-linked Khorasan group this way Wednesday at a defense writer's breakfast: "The briefings we had indicated that there was a growing ability, near ability to put together an explosive device which could get through the security at airports and that's all I can tell you. And they were at a point, at a critical point in being able to develop that capability." Two American officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal decision-making, told the AP that the government was concerned that the group could go underground after the AP reported that it was a top U.S. concern. A bulletin from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued Tuesday said U.S. officials had "no indicators of advanced al-Qaida or ISIL plotting in the homeland." But that memo, which used ISIL as an acronym for the militant Islamic State group, doesn't rule out terror plotting afoot elsewhere that could be focused on U.S. targets. ___ AP Intelligence Writer Ken Dilanian and AP writer Donna Cassata contributed to this report.
In time of capitalist crisis with declining economic wealth, growing threats of bankruptcy and intense demand for state subsidies, there is no basis for sharing wealth – even unequally – between capitalist, bankers, creditors and workers, debtors and rentiers. Competition over shrinking resources intensifies conflict over shares of a shrinking pie. The ruling class, facing a life and death struggle over survival, strikes back with all the forces – state and private – at its disposal to ensure that its financial needs are met .The public treasury exclusively finances its debts and stimulates its recovery of profits. Ruling class warfare defines who pays for the crisis and who benefits from the ‘recovery … of profits’. The crisis is, by turn, a temporary threat to the capitalist economic system and then, in the course of recovering from the crisis, a political economic and social pretext for a ruling class general offensive aimed at reversing labor and social advances over the past half century: Capitalist class warfare dismantles the social safety net and undermines the entire legal and ideological underpinnings of ‘welfare capitalism’. ‘Austerity’ is the chosen term to mark the ruling class’ seizure of the public treasury on its own behalf – without any regard for its social consequences. ‘Austerity’ is the highest form of class struggle from above because it establishes the arbitrary and unilateral power of capital to decide the present and future division between wages and profits, employment and unemployment and the returns to creditor states and the interest and principal payments of neo-colonial debtor states. As crisis deepens among debtor nations so does the ruling class intensify its class war on the workers, employees and small business classes. First, the creditor imperial states, (in Europe the Troika -the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank) overthrow the constitutional order by seizing control over state power. Then they proceed to decree macro and micro socio-economic policies. They decree employment, wage and fiscal policies. They decree the present and future allocation of state revenues between imperial creditors and local workers. Class warfare goes ‘global’: Regional organizations, like the European Union, which embody formally equal members, reveal themselves as imperial organizations for concentrating wealth among the dominant banks in the imperial centers. Class Struggle from Below in Time of Crisis The organizations of the workers – trade unions, pensioners’ associations, etc. – are ill-prepared to confront the open and aggressive all-out war of the ruling class. For decades they were accustomed to ‘collective bargaining’ and occasional strikes of short duration to secure incremental improvements. Their parties, labor or social democratic, with dual loyalties to capitalist profits and social welfare, are deeply embedded in the capitalist order .Under pressure of ‘the crisis’, they abandoned labor and embraced the formulae of the ruling class, imposing their own versions of ‘austerity’. Labor was abandoned; the working classes were on their own – without access to the state and without reliable political allies. The trade unions, narrowly focused on everyday issues and their immediate membership, ignored the mass of unemployed, especially the young unemployed, workers. The class struggle from below lacks the leadership, vision, organization and state resources, which the ruling class possesses, to launch a counter-offensive. Class struggle from below was, at first, entirely defensive; to salvage fragments of labor contracts, to save jobs or reduce firings. The fundamental problem in the ongoing class struggle is that the trade unions and many workers failed to recognize the changing nature of the class struggle: The ‘total war strategy’, adopted by the ruling class, went far beyond pay raises and profit reports and embraced a frontal attack on the living, working, housing, pension, health and educational conditions of labor. The politics of ‘social pacts’ between labor and capital was totally discarded by the ruling class .It demanded unconditional surrender of all social demands and seized the executive prerogatives of the state to enforce and implement the massive re-concentration of income and political power.
While the subprime mortgage crisis remains the epitome of what occurs when greed and corruption go unchecked, a growing number of experts and observers are warning that a new economic scandal is taking shape in the United States. In an article published earlier this month, Business Insider observed: “We just got even more evidence supporting the theory that charter schools are America’s new subprime mortgages.” The magazine wrote: The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released the results of a damning audit of the charter school industry which found that charter schools’ relationships with their management organizations pose a significant risk to the aim of the Department of Education. The findings in the audit, specifically in regard to charter school relationships with CMOs, echo the findings of a 2015 study that warned of an impending bubble similar to that of the subprime-mortgage crisis one of the authors, Preston C. Green III, told Business Insider. With more than 6,700 charter schools spread across 42 states and the District of Columbia, fraudulent activities associated with the publicly funded, but privately owned, charter school industry have become the fodder for almost daily news stories. According to an October 2015 investigation conducted by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD), the federal government has spent more than $3.3 billion over the past two decades on the creation and maintenance of the charter school industry. CMD noted: “The Department of Education is pushing for an unprecedented expansion of charter schools while paying lip service to accountability, but independent audit materials show that the Department’s lofty rhetoric is simply not backed up by its actions.” The report added, “the lack of tough financial controls and the lack of public access to information about how charters are spending federal tax dollars has almost inevitably led to enormous fraud and waste.” The impact of waste, fraud and corruption are hardly isolated, with newspaper and blog headlines like “Who Is Profiting From Charters?,” “The Big Bucks Behind Charter School Secrecy,” “Financial Scandal and Corruption; The Ugly Charter School Scandal Arne Duncan Is Leaving Behind and As Scandals Plague Charter Schools, Calls for Oversight Grow” becoming increasingly commonplace. Recently, the depth of the charter school scandals even made it to John Oliver’s HBO show, “Last Week Tonight,” where he observed, in Philadelphia alone, at least 10 executives or top administrators have pleaded guilty in the last decade to charges like fraud, misusing funds and obstruction of justice. And earlier this fall, the Washington Post’s “Answer Sheet” blog focused on the growing controversies surrounding charter schools observing: Ohio and Utah are known in education circles for having extraordinarily troubled charter school sectors, and the same is true in Pennsylvania, where Auditor General Eugene DePasquale issued a report this year and declared his state’s charter school law the “worst” in the nation. But there is yet another place with a scandal-plagued charter sector, and is one that is receiving far less national attention than it should be: California. The Washington Post continued: “There is a never-ending stream of charter scandals coming from California. For example, a report released recently (by the ACLU SoCal and Public Advocates, a nonprofit law firm and advocacy group) found that more than 20 percent of all California charter schools have enrollment policies that violate state and federal law. A Mercury News investigation published in April revealed how the state’s online charter schools run by Virginia-based K12 Inc., the largest for-profit charter operator in the country, has ‘a dismal record of academic achievement’ but has won more than $310 million in state funding over the past dozen years.” Charter schools were originally envisioned to serve as incubators of excellence where teachers and schools were given the flexibility to explore alternative strategies for helping children succeed. However, that model was quickly replaced by those who saw charter schools as a mechanism to profit off the privatization of public education. Today, billions of taxpayer dollars are being diverted from the nation’s public schools to charter schools and with those funds has come a growing crisis of so-called education entrepreneurs who are using some of those scarce public funds to line their own pockets. With minimal oversight and regulation, the charter school scandals will grow until elected and appointed policymakers take dramatic action to overhaul the country’s charter school system and demand greater accountability from those involved.
Ever since President Ford pardoned Nixon, it has been a widely held assumption in American politics that any Vice President would likely pardon their President in the event of a scandal-based impeachment. Certainly it would have happened if any President since committed similar crimes. As is the case in so many areas, Donald Trump changes everything. Mike Pence had little or no relationship with Donald Trump prior to being nominated as Vice President – from the start, they had an arranged marriage. In fact, Pence backed Senator Ted Cruz in the Indiana GOP Presidential primary contest over Trump. That said, this is hardly unprecedented – numerous Presidential tickets have included uneasy bedfellows – but the degree to which Pence and Trump come from different wings of the party and different walks of life can hardly be overstated. Pence is an individual whose principal motivation in public life appears to be social issues, while Trump’s positions on abortion and other issues seem to be little more than a matter of convenience (indeed, he has held every position conceivable on abortion). With the possible exception of Vice President Dick Cheney, nobody agrees to serve as Vice President unless they have at least some hopes of becoming President. In the case of Pence, that rings especially true; he has been repeatedly publicly humiliated by Trump, and the only plausible reasons that he has stood by Trump are: He deeply, profoundly wants to become President He is the ultimate sacrificing loyal soldier on behalf of his party It’s for these reasons that there is a good chance Vice President Pence will not pardon Donald Trump.
For the purpose of this article, I will only discuss the two main ones. On the one hand, there is the original interpretation of the CS, also known as the “linguistic approach” that argues that an actor can transform an object into a security threat by discursively framing it in security terms. More specifically, securitization occurs through the issuing of “speech acts” that highlight the existential nature of a given issue (which is perceived to threaten the survival of a referent object, such as the state for example) and call for the use of extraordinary means to counter such threat (Wæver 1995 Wæver, O. 1995. Securitization and desecuritization. In: R.D. Lipschutz, ed. On security. New York: Columbia University Press, 46–86. [Google Scholar] ). The issue is considered to be successfully securitized if the issue comes to be understood as an existential threat and if the proposed extraordinary measures are accepted by an audience (Balzacq 2011 Balzacq, T., 2011. A theory of securitization: origins, core assumptions, and variants. In: T. Balzacq, ed. Securitization theory: how security problems emerge and dissolve. New Security Studies, PRIO. Abingdon: Routledge, 1–30. [Google Scholar] ). On the other hand, it is possible to identify a “sociological approach”, which emerged as a reaction to the CS's proposal that securitization is a process solely associated to language. The “sociological approach” defends, instead, that securitization can occur through both discursive and non-discursive practices, such as bureaucratic and administrative routines, usage of technology and techniques (Huysmans 2011 Huysmans, J., 2011. What's in an act? On security speech acts and little security nothings. Security dialogue, 42 (3), 371–383. 10.1177/0967010611418713 [Crossref], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] , Stritzel 2007 Stritzel, H., 2007. Towards a theory of securitization: Copenhagen and beyond. European journal of international relations, 13 (3), 357–383. 10.1177/1354066107080128 [Crossref], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] , 2012 Stritzel, H., 2012. Securitization, power, intertextuality: discourse theory and the translations of organized crime. Security dialogue, 43 (6), 549–567. 10.1177/0967010612463953 [Crossref], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). As a result, this approach claims that the analysis of utterances and their performative nature can only provide a partial view of a securitization process, and that a complete view also needs to include the analysis of the practices following such utterances and of the contextual conditions enabling them (Balzacq et al. 2010 Balzacq, T., et al., 2010. Security practices. In: R.A. Denemark, ed. International studies encyclopedia online. Blackwell: Blackwell Publishing, 1–30. [Google Scholar] , Balzacq, 2011 Balzacq, T., 2011. A theory of securitization: origins, core assumptions, and variants. In: T. Balzacq, ed. Securitization theory: how security problems emerge and dissolve. New Security Studies, PRIO. Abingdon: Routledge, 1–30. [Google Scholar] ). It also argues that shifting our attention from speech acts to practices (including both discursive and non-discursive) allows us to distance ourselves from the exceptionality of securitization and to focus on the daily routines that are at the basis of how security operates. The considerable differences between these two approaches have consequences for the way we operationalize our analyses of securitization processes, and ultimately, for whether we can consider them to have been successful or not. In order to examine whether ST can help us understand the evolution of OC as a security issue, sections two and three of this article will reflect on the application of these different approaches. Although some authors working on OC have also discussed whether securitization processes have succeeded or not (Jackson 2006 Jackson, N., 2006. International organizations, security dichotomies and the trafficking of persons and narcotics in post-soviet central Asia: a critique of the securitization framework. Security dialogue, 37 (3), 299–317. 10.1177/0967010606069062 [Crossref], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ), insufficient attention has been devoted to the methodology employed to reach such conclusion (Balzacq 2011 Balzacq, T., 2011. A theory of securitization: origins, core assumptions, and variants. In: T. Balzacq, ed. Securitization theory: how security problems emerge and dissolve. New Security Studies, PRIO. Abingdon: Routledge, 1–30. [Google Scholar] ). In particular, little work has been carried out in terms of exploring which criteria or indicators can be used to justify success or failure claims. In view of countering this gap, the article will have recourse to discourse analysis and process-tracing to explore the practices of the different actors in the field, the coherence (or absence of) between discursive and non-discursive practices, the social mechanisms and the turning points in the construction of OC as a very serious security threat. Regarding the indicators specifically, and basing itself on Bourbeau's (2011 Bourbeau, P., 2011. The securitization of migration. London: Routledge. [Google Scholar] ) work, this article wishes to justify its arguments by identifying institutional and practices’ indicators. The institutional ones regard the way OC is presented by the EU, its relevance within the EU's agenda, its perceived level of threat, the amount of declarations and official acts that have been enacted on this topic over time, and also the absence of compliance or cooperation. The practices’ indicators focus on whether official acts have resulted in the development of instruments to counter OC, on how these instruments are being used, and whether they are producing results in terms of an increase in the number of arrests. Applying a “linguistic approach” to the emergence and development of EU counter-organized crime policies Following the idea that ST should not be understood as a unitary theoretical framework and that at least two main approaches can be distinguished, the second section of the article proposes to explore the application and limitations of the “linguistic approach”. Methodologically, it will proceed by analysing the main international and European official documents in the area of OC, by paying particular attention to the justification for the creation of new legal texts and measures. An inherited security discourse: the EU as a securitization importer We do not need to go far back in time to find a period where Europe did not consider OC to be a security problem. Not only did the majority of European states understand it to be an external issue, but they also had very different takes on what OC was (Fijnaut and Paoli 2004 Fijnaut, C. and Paoli, L., 2004. Organized crime in Europe: concepts, patterns and control policies in the European Union and beyond. Dordrecht: Springer. [Crossref], [Google Scholar] ). This does not mean that they were crime-free, but rather that they did not conceive OC as being more serious or separate from other types of crime. Most European countries did not feel the need, up until the 1980s, to adopt legislation or specific instruments in this area.2 2. In this context, Italy is most certainly an exception, having been the first European country to adopt legislation to counter OC, already in the mid-1960s (Mitsilegas 2003 Mitsilegas, V., 2003. From national to global, from empirical to legal: the ambivalent concept of transnational organised crime. In: M.E. Beare, ed. Critical reflections on transnational organized crime, money laundering, and corruption. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 55–87. [Google Scholar] , pp. 56–57). View all notes How can we, then, explain Europe's shift from not understanding OC as a security threat, to being one of the regions with the highest amount of anti-OC initiatives a few decades later (Fijnaut and Paoli 2004 Fijnaut, C. and Paoli, L., 2004. Organized crime in Europe: concepts, patterns and control policies in the European Union and beyond. Dordrecht: Springer. [Crossref], [Google Scholar] , pp. 633–637)? This first section would like to explore the securitization of OC by the USA, and its subsequent exporting to Europe through the dissemination of norms and rules by international organizations. OC first became the object of serious political and academic debate in the USA in the 1930s (Woodiwiss 2003 Woodiwiss, M., 2003. Transnational organized crime: the global reach of an American concept. In: M.E. Beare, ed. Transnational organized crime: perspectives on global security. London: Routledge, 3–34. [Google Scholar] ). It was mainly regarded as a growing economic problem, stemming from the existence of public demand for illegal goods. This economic perspective would, however, quickly be replaced by a security one in the 1940s and 1950s, with OC being identified with immigrant-dominated groups, whose goal was understood as the corruption of society: “the tentacles of organized crime reach into virtually every community throughout the country” (US Senate 1951a US Senate, 1951a. Kefauver committee, 3rd interim report. US Senate Special Committee to investigate organized crime in interstate commerce. 1 May. [Google Scholar] , p. 147). This change was very visible in public discourse, with the emphasis on reforming society being substituted with the need for stronger law enforcement and the imagery of warfare against OC (Von Lampe 2001 Von Lampe, K., 2001. Not a process of enlightenment: the conceptual history of organized crime in Germany and the United States of America. Forum on crime and society, 1 (2), 99–116. [Google Scholar] ). Between the 1930s and the 1960s, it was possible to observe, in the USA, a securitization of OC, which would lead to its labelling as a very serious security threat, “a serious menace which […] could wreck the very foundation of this country” (US Senate 1951c US Senate, 1951c. Kefauver committee, 2nd interim report. US Senate Special Committee to investigate organized crime in interstate commerce. 28 February. [Google Scholar] , p. 5). Such securitization process, taking the American society and values as its referent object, would eventually lead to the creation of special governmental bodies: “everywhere throughout the country citizens, […] have risen up to demand greater vigilance in stamping out crime and corruption” (US Senate 1951b US Senate, 1951b. Kefauver committee, final report. US Senate Special Committee to investigate organized crime in interstate commerce. 31 August.
No single strategy will generate 1 million additional undergraduate STEM degrees over the next decade, because the challenge has many dimensions. It entwines facts and logic with academic culture, incen­ tives, and belief systems. Therefore the recommendations presented here address various stakeholders and use both tangible resources and persuasion to inspire and catalyze change in undergraduate STEM education. By attacking the issue from a number of angles with various tools, including public exhorta­ tion, faculty incentives, resources, information, and institutional connections, the concerted forces can reach a point at which the movement takes on a momentum of its own and leads to sweeping change. Barriers to change vary with institution type and context. Some institutions may respond to a desire to be on the cutting edge of education, some to new resources, and others to the desire to maintain fund­ ing for and prestige of their graduate programs. Some faculty will be interested in change but will not know how to accomplish it; others will be waiting to hear from their administrations that this change is important and will be rewarded. Some students might benefit most from engaging in research, while others might be more in need of bolstering their math skills. Therefore, we propose promoting change with actions that address diverse students, faculty, departments, institutional leadership, industrial interests, and professional societies.68 Our recommendations aim to overcome many barriers, from lack of faculty time for studying the education literature to the inability of students to re­enter college after they take a break from their education..
Education as a form of acculturation has come to be defined as the acquisition of social and human capital. This process depends on increases in knowledge in the workforce at large. Education has become instrumental to business values. Profit-making operations dominate the world, increasingly also in the world of education (Rustin, 2016:150, 153). There is a tendency not only to reconstitute schools and universities as corporations and to manage their affairs along business lines (Rustin, 2016:154). Welch (1998:171) concludes that the neoliberal approach to education could be seen as an effort towards "a broader reshaping of the social order". Education should be made more cost-efficient through cost containment measures, neo-vocationalism, the commodification of knowledge, disempowerment and deskilling of teachers, the ability to do more with less, greater responsiveness to market forces, engaging in entrepreneurial activities, through quality improvement based on assessment, ranking and grading, quantification, calculability (numbers and figures) (Ball, 2003:215), consumerism, prediction, the use of non-human technology and opting for technicism. The key elements of the education reform package are embedded in three interrelated policy technologies: the market, managerialism and performativity. When employed together, these technologies offer a politically attractive alternative to the state-centred, public welfare tradition of educational provision (Ball, 2003:216). Education "reform" of this type is spreading across the world like a "policy epidemic" in "diverse and social locations which have very different histories" (Ball, 2003:215; compare the remark above about the different guises in which neoliberalism has appeared across the world). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) emphasises "monitoring systems" and the "production of information". These aspects of reform engender what Lyotard (1984:216) referred to as the "terror of performativity". As Foucault (1979:294) averred, the purpose of performativity and the concomitant neoliberal educational reform was to "produce bodies that are docile and capable" It is therefore important to understand that neoliberal precepts only reign supreme at schools and universities whose management echelons have fully bought in on neoliberal principles. As will be indicated below, the South African Government and Departments of Education seem to have bought in fairly extensively to such principles.
The overwhelming majority of states require no attention to diversity and integration by their charter schools for charter schools to receive and maintain a charter. Only twelve of the forty states and the District of Columbia authorizing charter schools have any integration or diversity requirements at all. Nevada and South Carolina have the strictest provisions because they have specific numerical goals. Nevada’s statute mandates that charter school enrollments be within ten percentage points of the student demographics of the school district in which the charter school is located. South Carolina mandates a more forgiving standard—twenty percentage points. California, Florida, Kansas, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Wisconsin do not specify any defined percentage, but generally require that their charter schools reflect the racial composition of the student enrollment in the surrounding school district. Connecticut, Hawaii, Ohio, and Rhode Island require a more general commitment to ensuring diverse student populations in their charter schools. In sum, of the forty-one jurisdictions allowing charter schools, only twelve pay some sort of statutory attention to integration. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia make no mention of either diversity or integration. Even the states requiring some attention to student demographics have limited enforcement measures. A South Carolina charter school running afoul of the racial standard need only prove that the school is not ―operating in a racially discriminatory manner. Likewise, Nevada requires the integration only ―if practicable. I found no specific, statutory guidance on how the schools were to attain racial balance. I found no state that included any provisions on producing integration. Instead, charter school legislation treats all students alike in terms of admission and outreach efforts. Given the differences by race and class embedded in choice, treating everyone alike almost guarantees segregative outcomes. Not surprisingly, even states with racial balancing provisions have segregated charter schools. An examination of charter schools in Nevada and South Carolina, the only states with specific numerical diversity requirements, reveals that their charter schools still suffer from segregation. Through a quick study of the states’ websites, I easily discovered schools in each state that were segregated when compared to the school’s surrounding school district. For example, in Nevada, Rainbow Dreams Academy is more than 90 percent black, while its surrounding school district (Las Vegas, Clark County) is 12 percent African American. That same school district, which is 32 percent white, also has a charter school, Beacon Academy of Nevada, with a 62 percent white student population. In South Carolina, approximately 13 percent of the charter schools are virtual, online schools. One such school operating in Columbia, South Carolina, is 68 percent white, while the two school districts in Columbia are overwhelmingly African American. The disconnect between charter school legislation promoting racial balance and the practice of segregation is not new. An earlier study by the U.S. Department of Education identified twelve states with high rates of segregation in their charter schools. Yet, five of the states listed also required racial balancing in their charter schools. In sum, the reality of charter school operations contradicts legislative racial balancing provisions, suggesting their ineffectiveness and meaninglessness.
Here I will use the term of engagement to some extent in line with the definition of Haass and OíSullivan. Thus, the term engagement is understood as a positive foreign policy strategy, which depends to a significant degree on positive incentives to achieve its objectives. However, the engaging strategy does not preclude the simultaneous use of negative instruments, such as sanctions or military force, but in order to be understood as engaging strategy the use of positive incentives should play leading role (2000:2). Thus, the term engagement is seen in a positive light, referring to constructive efforts in order to engage the country in case to the international community. Even though some negative means might be used to some extent by side of the engaging strategy, engagement means generally a conflict preventing approach which can be understood as tension reduction, conciliation, appeasement and incentives and use of positive methods to cooperate with proliferators (Baldwin 1985:111).
One of the scariest ideas in the world is the possibility that technological progress is petering out. Without it, there can be no long-run economic expansion or ongoing improvement in the human condition. Modern societies and economies are built on the assumption of growth, but even if they were to be reorganized to adapt to a static world, it could be very bad. The return to a zero-sum world could bring back the constant warfare and strife that prevailed in the distant past, if the only way for people to prosper was at other people’s expense. But what does it mean for innovation to slow down? Technology isn’t just one thing — progress can be rapid in some areas but slow in others. Economists typically measure a society’s overall level of technology by looking at total factor productivity, a measure of how much an economy produces relative to inputs of capital and labor. Here, we do see a worldwide slowdown in developed countries since the mid-2000s: Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis * 2011 = 1 Productivity isn’t just technology — it also takes into account institutions, like taxes and infrastructure. But the fact that the slowdown is happening in so many countries, with very different institutions, implies that something deeper than the quirks of local policy is at work. One possibility is that the rise of free digital services is causing productivity to be undermeasured, since official numbers don’t include the value of things that people get for free. But even if this is true, research by economist Chad Syverson shows that adding back the missing productivity probably wouldn’t change the story much. The most ominous possibility is that new scientific and technological ideas are simply getting harder to find. This possibility was raised by my Bloomberg View colleague Tyler Cowen in his 2011 book “The Great Stagnation.” Economist Robert Gordon elaborated on the thesis five years later in his magisterial work, “The Rise and Fall of American Growth.” The scary idea is that easy-to-discover technology is a finite, exhaustible resource. You can derive some of the basic laws of physics by rolling balls down ramps in your house. You can deduce the idea of biological inheritance by playing with pea plants in your garden. Because these things are so easy to research, they get discovered first. But to develop lithium-ion batteries, invasive neurotechnology, or gene therapy requires hundreds or thousands of researchers, strung out in a massive network of academic, government and corporate labs all over the world, using billions of dollars of equipment. Once the universe’s low-hanging fruit has been picked, it takes ever more money and manpower to pick the next bushel. That daunting prospect has received some support from a new paper by economists Nicholas Bloom, Charles I. Jones, John Van Reenen and Michael Webb, entitled “Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” They look at several areas in fields like semiconductors, agriculture and medicine, and find that while steady progress continues, keeping it going has required an ever-increasing army of researchers. That’s true whether productivity is measured economically, or in more concrete terms like crop yields, new drug discoveries, transistor density on computer chips, or the number of academic publications. Here are Bloom et al.’s estimates for research productivity in various fields: Even the fabled Moore’s Law — the tendency of the number of transistors in an integrated circuit to double every 1.5 to 2 years — is requiring a rising number of semiconductor researchers to sustain. I think Bloom et al.’s paper paints too dismal a picture. In reality, technology doesn’t only grow by improving old products and ideas, but by inventing totally new ones — progress is qualitative as well as quantitative. Innovation is sort of like mining — researchers are always hitting new veins of ideas that they rapidly exploit, but old veins get exhausted. Forty years ago, fields such as gene therapy and machine learning were niche areas, while solar power was stuck in slow mode due to high costs. Now, those are some of the hottest areas in all of science. By focusing more attention on older, mature areas of incremental innovation, Bloom et al. underemphasize the new. But even so, the economy-wide numbers are discouraging. That the number of researchers keeps increasing while productivity stagnates suggests that the old veins of technological progress are being mined out faster than the rich new veins are being discovered. Spectacular progress in a few high-profile technologies is worth cheering, but it doesn’t necessarily make up for slowdowns in a much larger number of less-glamorous fields.
Washington also is dedicating more intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets to the campaign against the Islamist militants in the region and plans to provide additional training to Nigerian infantry forces, the officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration’s plans.
U.S. Engagement Though it does not directly blame the United States, the white paper shows China’s deep concern over increasing U.S. engagement in the South China Sea. The U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft directly flying over a Chinese administered artificial island constructed atop the Fiery Cross Reef is not constructive to the management of the South China Sea dispute, nor is it helpful for fostering a healthy Chinese-U.S relationship in the maritime domain. There has been a debate between the U.S. and China whether all types of military activities in a foreign country’s EEZ fall under the scope of freedom of navigation. In addition to the question of the legitimacy of the United States’ activities under UNCLOS, activities of this kind have the potential to trigger accidents at sea, like EP 3 in 2001, which is not in the either China’s or the United States’ interest.
Despite this history, and the unambiguous expression of Congressional intent that parole should be used only in a very limited set of circumstances, it is disturbing that the Administration has expanded the use of parole and ignored the Congressional intent on the use of this authority.  Indeed, with each parole program implemented by this Administration, further damage is caused to the Constitutional authority of the United States Congress to establish a uniform set of immigration laws.  We note with particular concern the proliferation in recent years of new parole programs that effectively create entirely new visa categories and repeat all the abuses that triggered the IIRIRA reforms in the first place:
In this analysis, we focus on using economic conditions to understand when rivalries are likely to escalate or end. Rivalries are an appropriate set of cases to use when examining substitutability both because leaders in rival states have clearly substitutable choices and because rivalries are a set of cases in which externalization is a particularly plausible policy option.7 In particular, when confronted with domestic problems, leaders in a rivalry have the clear alternatives of escalating the conflict with the rival to divert attention or to work to settle the rivalry as a means of freeing up a substantial amount of resources that can be directed toward solving internal problems. In the case of the diversion option, rivals provide logical, believable actors for leaders to target; the presence of a clear rival may offer unstable elites a particularly inviting target for hostile statements or actual conflict as necessary. The public and relevant elites already consider the rival a threat or else the rivalry would not have continued for an extended period; the presence of disputed issues also provides a casus belli with the rival that is always present. Rivals also may provide a target where the possible costs and risks of externalization are relatively controlled. If the goal is diversion, leaders willwant to divert attention without provoking an actual (and expensive)war. Over the course of many confrontations, rival states may learn to anticipate response patterns, leading to safer disputes or at least to leaders believing that they can control the risks of conflict when they initiate a new confrontation. In sum, rivals provide good targets for domestically challenged political leaders. This leads to our first hypothesis, which is as follows: Hypothesis 1: Poor economic conditions lead to diversionary actions against the rival. Conflict settlement is also  a distinct route to dealing with internal problems that leaders in rivalries may pursue when faced with internal problems. Military competition between states requires large amounts of resources, and rivals require even more attention. Leaders may choose to negotiate a settlement that ends a rivalry to free up important resources that may be reallocated to the domestic economy. In a “guns versus butter” world of economic trade-offs, when a state can no longer afford to pay the expenses associated with competition in a rivalry, it is quite rational for leaders to reduce costs by ending a rivalry. This gain (a peace dividend) could be achieved at any time by ending a rivalry.  However, such a gain is likely to be most important and attractive to leaders when internal conditions are bad and the leader is seeking ways to alleviate active problems. Support for policy change away from continued rivalry is more likely to develop when the economic situation sours and elites and masses are looking for ways to improve a worsening situation. It is at these times that the pressure to cut military investment will be greatest and that state leaders will be forced to recognize the difficulty of continuing to pay for a rivalry. Among other things, this argument also encompasses the view that the cold war ended because the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics could no longer compete economically with the United States. Hypothesis 2: Poor economic conditions increase the probability of rivalry termination. Hypotheses 1 and 2 posit opposite behaviors in response to a single cause (internal economic problems). As such, they demand a research design that can account for substitutability between them.
In general, it is acknowledged by most economists that RTAs have actively contributed to lowering of trade barriers globally over the past few decades (Baldwin 1997, World Bank 2000, Mashayekhi and Ito 2005), implicitly confirming that RTAs have created an effective ‘‘learning process’’ for emerging countries in favouring integration and gradual openness, preparing possibly better conditions for further steps forward (Hufbauer and Schott 2007), and in creating wider and deeper liberalization targets. More relevant in the globalization process is the fact that RTAs have also often been able to bring measures other than purely ‘‘border-related’’ barriers into countries’ liberalization agendas, including ‘‘behind-the-border’’ measures and noneconomic fields of cooperation, which have often been either neglected or excluded from multilateral negotiations. All of these factors might facilitate objectively economic development for participating countries as they embrace wider and deeper forms of integration. Moreover, regionalism has evolved in a generally favourably way over the past two decades, facilitating processes of economic liberalization. In the 1950s–1970s RTAs were heavily dominated by a ‘‘closed regionalism’’ approach, especially in Latin America. It was the result of a highly-protectionist approach to economic development, i.e., import-substitution industrialization (ISI), i.e., high barriers and an inward-focus. In this model, industrial policy utilises trade policy as an instrument to protect infant industries in a way that would not be consistent with the strict economic definition but rather a euphemism for protectionism. The Latin American FTA in the 1960s is an excellent example of this approach; it also ended in failure (Dana et al. 2007).
POWER PLAYS Latin America's economic growth and political stability are driving an unprecedented power shift within the region. Countries are reassessing their interests and alliances, and the more confident among them are flexing their muscles. Instead of looking to Washington for guidance, Latin American countries are increasingly working among themselves to conduct diplomacy, pursue shared objectives, and, at times, even spark new rivalries. Brazil's emergence as a serious power is a direct result of the increasing absence of U.S. influence in the region. Sensing an opportunity to gain the regional stature that has long eluded it, the country has begun to act more assertively. But complicating Brazil's power play is the reaction from its fellow Latin American nations. Colombian, Mexican, and Peruvian officials, among others, talk privately about their dislike of Brazil's arrogant diplomacy. In some quarters, Brazil's responses to developments such as Chavez's ongoing assault on Venezuela's democracy and even the 2009 coup in Honduras have undermined its credibility as a serious leader. (Brasilia's reluctance to speak out for hemispheric democracy is particularly inexcusable for a government that includes many officials who suffered under the successive military regimes of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.) Many Latin American officials quietly reveal that they are not eager to see Brazil replace the United States as the hemisphere's hegemon. As one diplomat recently put it, "The new imperialists have arrived, and they speak Portuguese." Yet Brazil is learning that leadership means responsibility. Relations with its neighbor Bolivia are a case in point. After the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was kicked out of Bolivia, Brasília belatedly realized that Bolivia's cocaine exports-most of which are destined for Brazil, Argentina, or Europe-represented a serious challenge and so stepped up its counternarcotics cooperation with Bolivia. Fortunately, the United States and Brazil are eager to work together on counternarcotics. Bolivia will be a key test of this cooperation- made all the more important by the bitter diplomatic flap that erupted in May 2010 between U.S. President Barack Obama and then Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva over the Iranian nuclear deal brokered by Brazil and Turkey. Colombian leaders are also aware of the shifting balance of power within Latin America. With the recent departure of the inimitable Lula, whose charisma and presence overshadowed the efforts of other Latin American leaders, Santos now believes his government can assume the mantle of regional leadership by adopting a more balanced foreign policy, one less dependent on Washington. Although Santos has no desire to do away with his country's long-standing closeness to the United States, he understands that Colombia's credibility is now more dependent on its ability to cooperate with other regional governments, most important of all, Brazil's. Further evidence of Colombia's diplomatic and strategic maturity can be found in the way it has begun exporting its counterinsurgency and counternarcotics expertise to places as far away as Afghanistan. For almost half a century, the Colombian government has waged a bloody war against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or farc. But it has been only in the past several years that the Colombian state, backed by billions of dollars in U.S. assistance, has gained the upper hand. Overwhelmed by this fight until recently, Colombia's security forces now use their hangars and equipment to train pilots from Mexico and Peru and counternarcotics operatives from Afghanistan. As Latin America comes into its own, it is beginning to rely more on its own multilateral bodies. For the past 60 years, the Organization of American States, headquartered in Washington, has struggled to gain credibility in the region, as critics saw it as a guise for U.S. domination. In recent years, however, it has codified the primacy of democracy in its guiding principles-an important development suggesting that oas members now consider democracy a shared goal as opposed to a foreign imposition. Meanwhile, in 2008, Brazil helped create the Union of South American Nations, or unasur, which Brazilian leaders quietly hope will replace the oas as the default regional body in South America. But so far, its record has been mixed.To date, unasur has prioritized regional integration and solidarity over promoting democratic practices. And much to the chagrin of some in Brasília, the oas demonstrated its importance when it helped coordinate the regional diplomatic response following the coup in Honduras in 2009, an effort that likely staved off even greater strife in the country. The oas also renewed its relevance during its General Assembly meeting that same year, when a debate regarding Cuba's 1962 suspension from the body produced a consensus that Cuba's return to full membership should depend on its transition to democracy. The seemingly moribund organization has shown some surprisingly gritty determination, but there is new competition in the neighborhood.
The farm economy, which experienced some of its highest real income levels since the 1970s from 2009-13, is weathering lower crop prices, said David Oppedahl, senior business economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Oppedahl, who directs the Chicago Fed's survey of agricultural banks on land values and credit conditions, spoke at last week's Money Smart Ag Conference at Hawkeye Community College. With economic turmoil in other parts of the world, the exchange value of the U.S. dollar has strengthened but it is still far below its 2002 peak, Oppedahl said. U.S. trade is exceeding earlier peaks and while imports are greater than exports, the margin is tightening with oil and agriculture playing a role. A stronger dollar means U.S. exports are more expensive, which is a factor contributing to USDA's projection that agricultural exports will be down in 2015, although ag exports, which have been at record levels, will continue to be strong. "With a rising middle class around the world and more mouths to feed, agricultural exports will continue to grow in the long term," Oppedahl said. What happens in agriculture is important to the Chicago Federal Reserve because it remains the backbone of the economy, Oppedahl said. The states which make up the Chicago Fed, Iowa and most of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin, are leaders in corn, soybean, hog, egg, dairy and beef production. Fed stakeholders are commercial banks that make agriculture. Increasing surpluses have brought lower corn and soybean prices, Oppedahl said. Dairy and hog prices, which finished the year very strong, have started falling. Indications are that high cattle prices may be headed down in the coming year. "Everyone in agriculture needs land and that's why we follow farmland value carefully," Oppedahl said. "It accounts for over 75 percent of the sector's asset value and is an indicator of agriculture's health. Farmland values affect collateral values and portfolio quality and have an impact on lending institutions." Dramatically declining land values were a factor in the 1980s farm crisis, but Oppedahl said this downturn won't be as dramatic. The Chicago Federal Reserve released its most recent farmland value survey on Feb. 12, two days after Oppedahl's speech. The Seventh Federal Reserve District reported an annual decrease of 3 percent in "good'' farmland values for 2014, marking the first yearly decline since 1986. Farmland values in the fourth quarter of 2014 remained largely the same as in the third quarter, according to survey respondents from 224 banks across the District. Farmland values were down 2 percent for the district as a whole for the July 1 to Oct. 1, 2014 quarter. Iowa values were down 7 percent for 2014 and 1 percent for the fourth quarter after dropping 6 percent in the third quarter, according to the survey. Cash rents, which lag behind land values, have headed up in recent years and have started to come down as well. Net farm income while down is relatively strong, Oppedahl said. Government farm payments are lower but more risk management tools available to farmers. Credit conditions on agricultural loans have improved in recent years because of strong farm income with only about 2 percent of loans in troubled status, although in 2014 conditions have weakened some, Oppedahl said. Real farm sector assets and equity are at record levels. Interest rates are low but will likely climb slowly in the next few years. "While it's an uncertain future, it's not the 1980s," Oppedahl said. "The fundamentals are mixed on the direction of farmland values, but remain positive for the longer term."
"Cooperative federalism," in theory, is "a system in which... divided authority is brought together again" in a way that "enables the cooperating governments to benefit from one another's special capacities while still preserving the value of political pluralism."47 A scholar in the field of environmental policy recently described the "operative" principle of cooperative federalism as follows: "the federal government establishes a policy.., and then enlists the aid of the states, through a combination of carrots, such as financial aid, and sticks, such as the imposition of constraints.., through federal regulation, in pursuing that policy."48 The IDEA, enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause,49 fits squarely within this model by leaving to the states the "primary responsibility for developing and executing educational programs for handicapped children," while imposing "significant requirements to be followed in the discharge of that responsibility" as a pre-requisite for federal financial assistance. 50
THE World Health Organisation [WHO] has warned that antibiotic-resistant bacteria have now spread to every part of the world, giving rise to the potential for a series of untreatable epidemics. Its report says that global misuse of antibiotics has increased the number of drug-resistant superbugs, which can render curable diseases lethal again. "The world is headed for a post-antibiotic era where common infections and minor injuries will kill once again," said Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general for health security at the WHO. The study, which is the first of its kind, correlated data from 114 different countries to measure resistance to antibiotics. It focused on bacteria that cause common but serious diseases. In some countries, treatment is ineffective in more than half the cases of E. coli, The Guardian reports, as the bacteria is now resistant to the fluoroquinolone antibiotics used to treat it. In the UK, the report found high rates of resistance in gonorrhoea. Carmen Pessoa Da Silva, the doctor who leads the WHO's programme, says: "If no action is taken to reduce the spread of resistance and find new solutions, we will reach a point where some infections will no-longer be treatable." When antibiotics entered widespread use in the 1950s they have were regarded as a miracle cure, but no new antibiotic drug has been discovered in more than 30 years. According to New Scientist, pharmaceutical companies are unwilling to invest large sums in developing new drugs that are used only for brief courses of treatment. In 2013 Britain's Chief Medical Officer, Dr Sally Davies, described antibiotic resistance as "a ticking time bomb" that posed a similar threat to terrorism, CBS reports.
SANTA CRUZ, Calif. —Santa Cruz is ditching its plan for residents to vote in 2014 on a highly controversial seawater desalination plant, officials announced Tuesday morning. ¶ RELATED¶ Former Dodgers owner testifies in...¶ Sea otter mothers' devotion is...¶ Mountain lion hid in Mountain View...¶ 12-hour Watsonville standoff ends,...¶ World Cup soccer fever arrives in...¶ City leaders said they are taking a step back because they realized voters will not approve building the desalination plant project that was pitched to them by the city.¶ Santa Cruz will return to the drawing board and work together with the community in brainstorming possible water supply ideas, including a revised desal plan. ¶ “The City of Santa Cruz has an obligation to provide a clean and reliable source of water to our residents, businesses, organizations and visitors. Water is the most essential resource that the city provides to our citizens. It sustains our lives, our economy and environment, and ultimately the future of our community," Mayor Hilary Bryant said Tuesday. ¶ "Following an initial 60-day period and a 30-day extension, the official comment period for the desal project Environmental Impact Report closed on August 12. Project staff has conducted an initial review of the more than 400 comments made by members of our community and have briefed me. It is gratifying to see more people taking an active interest in issues related to our water supply, and potential solutions, than in recent memory," Bryant said.¶ A few themes became evident to the mayor and City Manager Martin Bernal:¶ • The Santa Cruz community is not ready for desalination at this time and we need a reset in the ongoing conversation on water supply and desal issues.¶ • Our water challenges in the City of Santa Cruz are part of a regional issue and need a regional approach.¶ • A greater focus on water conservation practices and potential is needed.¶ • Likely impacts of drought events need further exploration.¶ • The vital link between water supply and local economic health is not fully understood at this time.¶ “Santa Cruz clearly needs to redefine how we are engaging with the community on the subject of water supply," Bernal said. "Therefore, I am recommending a four-part plan to the City Council.¶
Intelligence officials said Tuesday that the government's sweeping surveillance efforts have helped thwart "potential terrorist events" more than 50 times since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, and the officials detailed two new examples to illustrate the utility of the programs. In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, officials cited a nascent plot to blow up the New York Stock Exchange and a case involving an individual providing financial support to an overseas terrorist group. "In recent years, these programs, together with other intelligence, have protected the U.S. and our allies from terrorist threats across the globe to include helping prevent the terrorist -- the potential terrorist events over 50 times since 9/11," National Security Agency Director Gen. Keith Alexander told the committee. He said at least 10 of the plots targeted the United States. FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce said Tuesday that a provision in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act helped officials monitor a "known extremist in Yemen" who was in contact with an individual in the United States. The information led to disruption of the New York Stock Exchange plot, Joyce said. Joyce also said that the use of a FISA business record provision helped officials with an investigation involving an individual who was communicating with an overseas terrorist. "The NSA, using the business record FISA, tipped us off that this individual had indirect contacts with a known terrorist overseas," said Joyce. "We were able to reopen this investigation, identify additional individuals through a legal process and were able to disrupt this terrorist activity." "So that's four cases total that we have put out publicly," Alexander said Tuesday. The Washington Post and Britain's Guardian newspaper recently revealed the sweeping Internet and telephone surveillance techniques the NSA has utilized in recent years. Several of the witnesses testifying Tuesday said the disclosure of the surveillance programs by admitted leaker Edward Snowden had made the world a more dangerous place. “We are now faced with a situation that because this information has been made public, we run the risk of losing these collection capabilities,” said Robert S. Litt, general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. “We’re not going to know for many months whether these leaks in fact have caused us to lose these capabilities, but if they do have that effect, there is no doubt that they will cause our national security to be affected.” Alexander had previously said the intelligence gathering helped in the cases of Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan American who pleaded guilty to planning suicide attacks in New York, and Pakistani American David Headley, who conducted surveillance in support of the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India. Joyce elaborated on the two previously revealed cases on Tuesday. Alexander said he would provide details of the 50 examples he cited Tuesday to lawmakers in a classified setting on Wednesday. "Those 50 cases right now have been looked at by the FBI, CIA and other partners within the community, and the National Counterterrorism Center is validating all the points so that you know that what we've put in there is exactly right," said Alexander. Alexander also said that if the surveillance programs had been in place before the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States would have known that hijacker Khalid Muhammad Abdallah al-Mihdhar was in San Diego and communicating with a known al Qaeda safehouse in Yemen. Alexander's testimony came a day after President Obama defended his administration’s right to engage in such surveillance in an interview with PBS host Charlie Rose, saying the programs had adequate checks and balances. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, Obama argued, provided sufficient oversight of the National Security Agency’s activities and said the government was “making the right trade-offs” in balancing privacy rights with national security prerogatives. “What I can say unequivocally is that if you are a U.S. person, the NSA cannot listen to your telephone calls, and the NSA cannot target your e-mails,” he added, before Rose interjected, “And have not.” “And have not,” Obama reiterated. “They cannot and have not, by law and by rule, and unless they — and usually it wouldn’t be ‘they,’ it’d be the FBI — go to a court, and obtain a warrant, and seek probable cause, the same way it’s always been, the same way when we were growing up and we were watching movies, you want to go set up a wiretap, you got to go to a judge, show probable cause.” During the interview — which aired Monday night — the president took pains to distinguish his national security approach from those of former president George W. Bush and former vice president Richard B. Cheney. “The whole point of my concern, before I was president — because some people say, ‘Well, you know, Obama was this raving liberal before. Now he’s, you know, Dick Cheney.’ Dick Cheney sometimes says, ‘Yeah, you know? He took it all lock, stock and barrel,’ ” Obama said, according to a transcript provided by PBS. “My concern has always been not that we shouldn’t do intelligence gathering to prevent terrorism, but rather are we setting up a system of checks and balances?”
BRUSSELS -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has promised to hold a referendum on NATO membership -- a move strongly opposed by Moscow -- as the country embarks on a path of European and Euro-Atlantic integration. Speaking in an interview on June 5 with RFE/RL that also ran on Ukraine's 1+1 channel, the recently elected Zelenskiy said Ukraine and its people had the right as a sovereign nation to choose the alliances they desire, regardless of outside opinions. "I said that we need to inform each Ukrainian about what NATO is like, which is not so terrible, and when Ukrainians are ready, we will definitely bring this issue to a referendum, and Ukraine will definitely be in NATO," said the former comic actor with no prior political experience who took over as president two weeks ago. Zelenskiy made the comments on the second and last day of his visit to Brussels -- his first foreign trip since being elected -- where he held talks with top European Union and NATO officials. A day earlier, Zelenskiy said that Ukraine's "strategic course to achieve full-fledged membership in the EU and NATO" remained unchanged from the goal of his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko. Moscow has made explicit its opposition to NATO's further expansion, especially as regards to Ukraine and Georgia. Tbilisi is also seeking to become a member of the Western military alliance. Fighting between government forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine has killed some 13,000 people since April 2014, shortly after Russia seized control of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. Cease-fire deals announced as part of the Minsk accords in September 2014 and February 2015 have contributed to a decrease in fighting in the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk but have failed to hold. NATO and the European Union have invested heavily in Ukraine and its 44 million people, who in addition to the conflict and Russia's occupation of Crimea face entrenched corruption and major economic hurdles. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has called Ukraine a "highly valued partner" that does not "recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea."
Global poverty is not solely a humanitarian concern. In real ways, over the long term, it can threaten[s] U.S. national  security. Poverty erodes weak states' capacity to prevent the spread of disease and protect the world's forests and watersheds--some of the global threats Maurice Greenberg noted in the Winter 2005 issue. It also creates conditions conducive to transnational criminal enterprises and  terrorist activity, not only by making desperate individuals potentially more susceptible to recruitment, but also, and more significantly, by undermining the state's ability to prevent and  counter those violent threats. Poverty can also give rise to the tensions that  erupt in civil conflict, which allows transnational predators greater freedom of action. Americans can no longer realistically hope that we can erect the proverbial glass dome over our homeland and live safely isolated from the killers--natural or man-made--that plague other parts of the world. Al-Qaeda established training camps in conflict-ridden  Sudan and Afghanistan, purchased diamonds from Sierra Leone and Liberia, and now targets American soldiers in Iraq. The potential toll of a global bird-flu pandemic is particularly alarming. A mutated virus causing human-to-human contagion could kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans. Today, more than half the world's population lives on less than $2 per day, and almost 1.1 billion people live in extreme poverty, defined as less than $1 per day. The costs of global poverty are multiple. Poverty prevents poor countries from devoting sufficient resources to detect and contain deadly disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), low- and middle-income countries suffer 90 percent of the world's disease burden but account for only 11 percent of its health care spending. Poverty also dramatically increases the risk of civil conflict. A recent study by the UK's Department for International Development showed that a country at $250 GDP per capita has on average a 15 percent risk of internal conflict over five years, while a country at $5,000 per capita has a risk of less than 1 percent. War zones provide ideal operational environments for international outlaws. If in the old days the consequences of extreme poverty could conveniently be confined to the far corners of the planet, this is no longer the case. The end of U.S.-Soviet competition, the civil and regional conflicts that ensued, and the rapid pace of globalization ha[s]ve brought to the fore a new generation of dangers.   These are the complex nexus of transnational security threats:  infectious disease, environmental degradation, international crime and drug syndicates, proliferation of small arms and weapons of mass destruction, and terrorism. Often these threats  emerge from impoverished, relatively remote  regions of the world. They thrive especially in conflict or lawless zones, in countries where corruption is endemic, and in poor, weak states with limited control over their territory or resources. The map of vulnerable zones is global--including parts of the Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, the Caucasus, and Central, South and East Asia. Fifty-three countries have an average per capita GDP of less than $2 per day. Each is a potential weak spot in a world in which effective action by states everywhere is necessary to reduce and combat transnational threats.
Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party is marching back into the presidential palace bolstered by its control of a raft of state governorships and a good standing in Congress. But its mandate is much shakier than the party had predicted before Sunday's election, reflecting the nagging suspicions with which many Mexicans regard the PRI and complicating President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto's ability to execute an ambitious reform program. He will have to negotiate with rival parties, including a newly empowered left, and will not have the free hand he might have expected as he pursues initiatives such as opening up the massive state oil company, Pemex, to foreign investment. Resistance from the opposition, as well as the old guard of his party and the unions that backed him, could block reforms and condemn Mexico to status quo and economic malaise. "His mandate is clearly weaker than expected," said Carlos Ramirez, a Mexico analyst for the New York-based Eurasia Group. "He will be in a tough spot. The view inside the party was that they were going to win by a landslide.... Peña will have to choose his battles because he's likely to encounter resistance from within his coalition."
The legislation would reform Section 36 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) to ensure that any supportive representative can move to discharge a joint resolution of disapproval against a proposed arms sale ten days following its introduction if the presiding committee fails to report it. Win the vote in the House, pass the same joint resolution in the Senate (or vice versa), and Congress has successfully exercised its primary legal means of immediately barring a harmful transfer (whether or not the White House agrees).
War involving significant fractions of the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, which are¶ by far the largest of any nations, could have globally catastrophic effects such as severely¶ reducing food production for years,1¶ potentially leading to collapse of modern civilization¶ worldwide and even the extinction of humanity.2¶ Nuclear war between the United States and¶ Russia could occur by various routes, including accidental or unauthorized launch; deliberate¶ first attack by one nation; and inadvertent attack. In an accidental or unauthorized launch or¶ detonation, system safeguards or procedures to maintain control over nuclear weapons fail in¶ such a way that a nuclear weapon or missile launches or explodes without direction from leaders.¶ In a deliberate first attack, the attacking nation decides to attack based on accurate information¶ about the state of affairs. In an inadvertent attack, the attacking nation mistakenly concludes that¶ it is under attack and launches nuclear weapons in what it believes is a counterattack.3¶ (Brinkmanship strategies incorporate elements of all of the above, in that they involve intentional¶ manipulation of risks from otherwise accidental or inadvertent launches.4¶ )¶ Over the years, nuclear strategy was aimed primarily at minimizing risks of intentional¶ attack through development of deterrence capabilities, though numerous measures were also¶ taken to reduce probabilities of accidents, unauthorized attack, and inadvertent war. For purposes¶ of deterrence, both U.S. and Soviet/Russian forces have maintained significant capabilities to¶ have some forces survive a first attack by the other side and to launch a subsequent counterattack.¶ However, concerns about the extreme disruptions that a first attack would cause in the¶ 1¶ other side’s forces and command-and-control capabilities led to both sides’ development of¶ capabilities to detect a first attack and launch a counter-attack before suffering damage from the¶ first attack.5¶ Many people believe that with the end of the Cold War and with improved relations¶ between the United States and Russia, the risk of East-West nuclear war was significantly¶ reduced.6¶ However, it has also been argued that inadvertent nuclear war between the United¶ States and Russia has continued to present a substantial risk.7¶ While the United States and Russia¶ are not actively threatening each other with war, they have remained ready to launch nuclear¶ missiles in response to indications of attack.8¶ False indicators of nuclear attack could be caused in several ways. First, a wide range of¶ events have already been mistakenly interpreted as indicators of attack, including weather¶ phenomena, a faulty computer chip, wild animal activity, and control-room training tapes loaded¶ at the wrong time.9¶ Second, terrorist groups or other actors might cause attacks on either the¶ United States or Russia that resemble some kind of nuclear attack by the other nation by actions¶ such as exploding a stolen or improvised nuclear bomb,10 especially if such an event occurs¶ during a crisis between the United States and Russia.11 A variety of nuclear terrorism scenarios¶ are possible.12 Al Qaeda has sought to obtain or construct nuclear weapons and to use them¶ against the United States.13 Other methods could involve attempts to circumvent nuclear weapon¶ launch control safeguards or exploit holes in their security.14¶ It has long been argued that the probability of inadvertent nuclear war is significantly¶ higher during U.S.-Russian crisis conditions,15 with the Cuban Missile Crisis being a prime¶ historical example. It is possible that U.S.-Russian relations will significantly deteriorate in the¶ future, increasing nuclear tensions. There are a variety of ways for a third party to raise tensions¶ between the United States and Russia, making one or both nations more likely to misinterpret¶ events as attacks.16¶ Although many deterrence system failure modes have been identified, additional research¶ could be valuable in identifying residual hazards, quantifying their relative risks, and informing¶ policies.17 Many analysts have recommended that analysis be performed of risks of inadvertent¶ nuclear war. Hellman18 suggested employing probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) methods, such as¶ those used in assessing risks at nuclear power plants. These can assess overall system failure¶ probabilities using fault trees to define relationships between failure-initiating events and¶ enabling conditions. The methods also incorporate information on system component failure¶ rates and interactions, with statistical estimation of system component failure rates and other risk¶ model parameters using available empirical data.19 Complete characterization of all relevant¶ nuclear weapons system component failure rates and interactions would require significantly¶ more information than is publicly available, though such interactions also may be impossible to¶ fully predict because of the complexity of relevant systems and their interactions.20 However,¶ useful characterization of at least some potential failure modes is provided in the literature on¶ inadvertent nuclear war hazards, and relatively limited amounts of such information have yielded¶ important insights in previous estimates of probabilities of specific nuclear inadvertent nuclear¶ war or other war scenarios.21 This paper incorporates and builds on that work.
“The ‘pakistanization’ of Turkey.” After the bombings in Ankara and Istanbul over the last week, it is hard to see Turkey as the economic and the democratically prosperous country it once was. Rather, with continued terrorist violence, many now question whether Turkey under the AKP is becoming a fragmented and semi failed state. A gateway between the Middle East and Europe, it was not long ago that Turkey was considered a darling amid a fractured Middle East. Nearly 15 years ago, in fact, the newly-elected Justice and Development Party (AKP) swept to power on the ambitious promise to transform the country. The nation’s economy, which had languished for decades, was radically transformed by a comprehensive neo-liberal economic agenda that heralded robust economic growth. This growth, in step with continued political reform, eventually saw Turkey mentioned as an unlikely candidate for EU membership. Not so anymore. Rather, recent times have seen Turkey’s star begin to fade, with the state slipping slowly into authoritarian rule. And despite boasting one of Europe’s best airlines, its once-vibrant tourist industry is in tatters, particularly since a series of terrorist attacks and policy blunders have seen Turkey becoming isolated, both regionally and internationally. The once bright star now better resembles a typical Middle Eastern Mukhabarat country than possible EU member, with an oppressive state apparatus and weak institutional framework dominating the modern Turkish state. Failure in regional policy In the wake of the Arab Spring, Turkey initially saw itself the leader in a new age of Islamist states. With Syria collapsing into civil war, however, Ankara soon engaged in an interventionist policy, as the personal relationship between Assad and Erdogan, who had reportedly once holidayed with one another, soon soured. To be sure, the ‘zero problems with neighbours’ foreign policy was soon upended by a series of continuing foreign policy mishaps. Turkey’s support and funding of Islamist elements in Syria, including groups like Jabhat Al-Nursa, and their ambivalent attitude towards Daesh, fanned the sectarian divisions that had already opened up across the Middle East. More recently, however, the shooting down of a Russian jet has seen Russia and Turkey pursue the start of a possible ‘hot’ war, with no end in sight to the seething animosity that has developed between the two. A growing Kurdish proto-state – which Moscow now supports – adds another dangerous dimension to the rivalry. While Turkey has shown a humane approach to the influx of Syrian refugees, Ankara’s recent statements appear as if they are using the refugee crisis to their political advantage as seen with the recent EU-Turkey deal. With talk of a declaration of semi-autonomy by Rojava, many are querying what the AKP’s next move will be and whether there will be an offensive into Syria. What is readily apparent, though, is that Ankara’s growing intransigence is contributing to the current domestic destabilization inside Turkey. Internal insecurity Since the Gezi protests and the corruption charges against top officials in the government in 2013, there has been a systematic push towards authoritarianism in Turkey. The centralization of authority has given more powers to the security apparatus within the Turkish state. The government has conducted its ‘witch-hunt’ against the ‘parallel state’ and internal dissidence that has seen a significant reduction in the independence of the judiciary. As such, there has been a continuing politicization of judicial decisions, with more and journalists facing arrests and imprisonment. The seizing of critical media outlets by court-appointed trustees, moreover, has also done little to promote economic and political stability for foreign investors. Meanwhile, purges of ‘Gulenist’ elements within the police and security forces by the Courts of Peace have left the Turkish security apparatus weakened and lacking much-needed experience and capabilities. The effects of these purges were demonstrated by the recent spate of bombings in Ankara and Istanbul. With security efforts focused on dissidents – especially given the broadening definition of what constitutes a ‘terrorist’ – there has been a lack of internal security when it has come to capturing potential PKK and ISIS terrorists. The recent bombings by TAK (a splinter faction of the PKK) have shown that the government’s war against the PKK can be brought to Western Turkey. The attacks in Istanbul on Istiklal Caddesi by ISIS-affiliated members against foreign tourists (despite German embassy warnings of an upcoming attack) are another telling example of recent intelligence failures further. On top of this, there has been virtually no one brought to account for these attacks. The government and intelligence forces, for their part, have stubbornly refused to accept the blame, despite the fact that the government appears helpless to safeguard their citizens from further attacks. What’s next for Turkey? For now, Turkish society remains polarized. Many still support the government’s agenda, especially in the country’s conservative heartland. In the West of Turkey, however, the story is different, with people asking how many bombings occur before someone is held accountable. And as the conflict in the country’s East reaching new proportions with government-led military operations occurring on a daily basis, many Kurds are fleeing the violence. Internal displacement is now at record levels. Aside from this, Turkey is also looking more and more Middle Eastern state; the shrinking presence of NGOs, critical media, and civil society, are in stark contrast to its liberal society only a few years ago. Further, as the government pursues its push for an executive presidential system in the ensuing chaos (despite deep polarization between the political parties and civil society on this issue), many are asking whether such a move is pushing Turkey to the brink. Unless Ankara implements drastic changes, including consistent efforts by the government in bringing about domestic stability, there is the distinct possibility of Turkey becoming another casualty in an increasingly unstable region.
I. Introduction Like other forms of debate, Cross-Examination (C-X or Policy) Debate focuses on the core elements of controversial issue. Cross-Examination Debate develops important skills, such as critical thinking, listening, argument construction, research, note-taking and advocacy skills. Cross-Examination Debate is distinct from other formats, with the exception of Parliamentary Debate, in its use of a two-person team. Cross-Examination Debate also places emphasis on questioning or cross-examination between constructive speeches. While specific practices vary, Cross-Examination Debate typically rewards intensive use of evidence, and is more focused on content than on delivery. II. Rules of Cross-Examination (Policy) Debate This section highlights the important rules that govern the Cross-Examination (Policy) Debate format. Because these rules focus on the goals and procedures of debate, they do not include all that might be considered, from a strategic perspective, principles of effective debate. A. Resolutions and Preparation The topic for Cross-Examination (Policy) Debate is typically called a "resolution" or "proposition." Different types of propositions may be used in a Cross-Examination (Policy) Debate, but policy propositions tend to be the most common. Different leagues, organizations or individual tournaments may use a particular resolution for a particular debate. So that clash might occur in a debate, debaters should engage in research on both sides of the topic. Research is primarily the job of debaters. Teachers and coaches may conduct research in order to improve their job performance and to facilitate the learning of their students, but should limit the amount of research they conduct for debaters. B. Interpretation of the Resolution Cross-Examination (Policy) Debate involves two teams, each consisting of two people. One team takes the affirmative position and is responsible for defending and supporting the resolution. The other team takes the negative and is responsible for refuting the affirmative, which may be done in a variety of strategic ways. The affirmative team is responsible for the initial interpretation of the resolution, and for presenting a case that defends and supports the resolution. The negative team may challenge this interpretation if they believe the affirmative team's interpretation is unreasonable. 2 1. Arguing a Case for the Resolution The objective of the affirmative team is to construct and present a case that defends and supports the resolution. An adequate case (one that meets a certain burden of proof) depends on what type of proposition is debated. Individual topics and tournaments determine what burden is required. 2. Arguing Against the Resolution The objective of the negative team is to refute the affirmative case, which, by extension, is an argument against the resolution. Depending on the topic and the type of proposition, the negative may have a variety of possible strategies available when refuting the affirmative case. C. Rules During the Debate 1. In-Round Research is Prohibited Topic research must be completed prior to the beginning of a debate. Once the debate begins, the participants may not conduct research via electronic or any other means. No outside person(s) may conduct research during the debate and provide it directly or indirectly to the debaters. Debaters, however, are allowed to use a dictionary to determine the meaning of English words. 2. Citations are Mandatory Debaters may cite or refer to any public information. When doing so, they should be prepared to provide complete source documentation to the opposing team and to the judge, upon request. A team's documentation of cited material must be complete enough so that the opposing team and the judge can locate the information of their own. Ordinarily, such documentation would include the name of an author (if any), the name and date of a publication, the URL of a Web site (if the information was retrieved electronically), and a page number (if
When comparing the economics of technologies, based on policy portfolios crafted to address GHG emissions, RET options will become increasingly favorable as extractive fuels and energy begin to reflect the cost of carbon when compared with the costs of RET — particularly when compounded with technical and learning cost decreases of RETs themselves. Further research is needed to understand how to continue to optimize the use of RET resources, including more sophisticated understanding of the systems-level integration across power, fuels, land use, transportation, and energy demand. Concepts for rethinking paradigms from the early 20th century are emerging, such as “load following supply” for electric power systems, and comprehensive community and regional planning that includes natural resource management and the full suite of residential/commercial and industrial elements to minimize energy or GHG emissions while providing optimal options for quality of life.9 Finally, future innovations in global financing mechanisms may work to align fiscal resources with RET development much the way 20th century infrastructure was supported in Europe and the United States (for examples of new approaches to financing low-GHG energy infrastructure, see Cory et al., 2008; Fuller et al., 2009). 5. Conclusions GHG emissions associated with energy extraction and use are a major component of any strategy addressing climate change mitigation. Renewable energy technologies (RETs) as well as biofuels technologies have been accelerating rapidly during the past decades, both in technology performance and cost-competitiveness — and they are increasingly gaining market share. These technology options offer many positive attributes, but also have unique cost/benefit trade-offs, such as land-use competition for bioresources and variability for wind and solar electric generation technologies. Given the growing interest and use in RETs as a viable short- and long-term option for limiting future climate change, key issues that need to be addressed for increased use of RETs include: • Continued innovation. For most RETS, costs remain high compared to fossil fuel alternatives. Many RETs are relatively immature technically and are, thus, poised for further (and perhaps significant) cost and performance improvements. Further, technologies such as storage systems and dynamic load management warrant further research. Technology innovation should be complemented by advances in system-level integration, geospatially and temporally high resolution resource data, forecasting, systems management, planning, and analytic methodologies. • Policy frameworks. To integrate RETs into the energy system, it is key to include portfolio approaches that address key issues such as comprehensive and comparable cost/benefit of all energy options, provision of stable and predictable policy environments, and transitional pathways as broader climate related (and CO2-price related) legislation and agreements are developed. • Improved analysis capabilities. Evaluating RETs in energy systems is especially important as transport electrification accelerates. This ranges from power/energy system models to integrated assessment models.
The economic crisis has an empirical basis in factual events and economic statistics, but is also a social construct. In a narrow sense, the term economic crisis refers to the worldwide recession of 2007–2008, which changed economic circumstances and investors’ outlooks and caused governments to nationalize and/or invest in failing banks and to stimulate the economy inter alia through bail outs, expansion of the money supply (quantitative easing), and low interest rates. It changed the lives of many whose employment or work conditions were drastically affected (Melike 2014). It also made many observers much more critical about capitalism and the stability of markets, especially financial markets (Murphy 2011, Stephan and Weaver 2011, Rifkin 2014, Weaver 2014). In Europe, the economic crisis was accompanied by (perceptions of) a debt crisis, a banking crisis, and a euro crisis, all interrelated. The financial crisis, debt crisis, bank crisis, neo-liberal crisis, and global financial collapse are not just different names but also refer to different, albeit closely related, empirical phenomena. Importantly, the perception and representation of such phenomena in crisis terms can give scope for motivating and/or justifying responses.
NOT so long ago, observers were agog at the sheer quantities of materials produced by China’s miracle economy. One newspaper reckoned that China had made more cement in two years than the United States did in the entire 20th century. But the days of double-digit economic growth are over, and many basic industries have ended up with massive overcapacity. As more and more of that spare capacity finds its way on to the world market, it looks likely to fuel a protectionist backlash.∂ The most striking case is steel. China produces roughly half of the world’s annual output of 1.6 billion tonnes. Analysts at UBS, an investment bank, reckon that this year it will produce 441m tonnes more than it will consume. With prices slumping, China’s 101 biggest steel firms lost some $11 billion during the first ten months of this year, according to one estimate, roughly twice what they made in profits last year. Unsurprisingly, they are seeking to export their unwanted product, even at a loss. Official data released this week confirm that China has, in the 11 months to November, exported over 100m tonnes of steel for the first time (see chart). China’s exports are now bigger than the total steel production of any country apart from Japan.∂ The American steel industry’s lobbyists have begun clamouring for action to stop what they consider illegal dumping of subsidised product. In Europe, an industry already suffering from cuts and closures is pushing the European Commission not to grant China “market economy” status, a legal designation that would make it harder to hold back the tide of Chinese imports.∂ Chinese officials are unbowed. President Xi Jinping, during his recent state visit to Britain, claimed that his country has already made big cuts in steelmaking capacity. On December 9th China threw more fuel on the fire by cutting export taxes on several types of steel. A trade war may be brewing, and steelmen are on the front lines.
Despite a lot of buzz about the Kremlin’s turn to the East in Russian political and media circles, there are some important challenges that would appear to hinder the future development of Russian-Chinese relations. With Russian President Vladimir Putin going to visit China in late June, the leading Moscow-based think tanks are considering the future trajectory of Russia-China relations. To what extent has Russia’s “pivot to the East” actually taken place? During the week of May 30, two events were dedicated to this question: the May 30-31 international conference “Russia and China: Taking on a New Quality of Bilateral Relations,” organized by the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), and the June 2 presentation of the new Valdai report “Toward The Great Ocean 4: Turn To The East.” While some experts argue that the pivot to China is in full swing, there are a lot of skeptics who think otherwise. According to them, Russia has failed to complete the turn to the East. The main factor they cite is that economic cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is not advancing as quickly as originally projected, evidenced by the lack of Chinese investment in Russia and the significant decrease of the trade turnover between the two countries. Lack of economic cooperation In fact, Russia-China trade dropped from about $88 billion to almost $64 billion between 2014 and 2015, according to the Valdai report. The RIAC report gives different data, but underlines the common trend: Russian-Chinese trade turnover plummeted from $95 billion to $68 billion over the same period of time. In comparison, China’s trade with Europe and the U.S. has been robustly increasing for the last three years. In 2015, it reached about $590 billion with the EU and almost $660 billion with the U.S., according to recent statistics. That’s why, economically, Russia’s pivot to the East has failed to take place, as RIAC General Director Andrei Kortunov told Russia Direct. “While Russian-Chinese trade has decreased by 30 percent, Beijing’s trade with Washington has been steadily rising despite geopolitical differences," he said. Moreover, some Chinese experts question Russia’s approaches of doing business. For example, Li Fenglin, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of China to Russia (1995-1998), is among the skeptics. During his speech at the RIAC conference, he said that Russia and China are lacking cooperation in the field of small and medium-sized business, which is overshadowed by the robust collaboration between the state gas monopolies of the two countries. Likewise, Evgeny Nadorshin, chief economist at PF Capital-Moscow, an investment company based in New York, argues that the model of China-Russia cooperation is outdated, with Russia exporting raw materials like gas and oil and China providing manufactured goods. Meanwhile, other participants of the RIAC conference believe that China’s level of investment is not increasing because of China’s tough manner of negotiating and its tenacity in promoting its national interests. The Chinese companies offer very tough conditions that Russians cannot accept, which accounts for the lack of Chinese investment in Russia, according to Kilzie Fares, the chairman of the board at CREON Energy, a Russian consultancy on the oil, gas and chemical industries. “Without economic collaboration, there won’t be the social foundation for robust political relations,” warns Kortunov.
1) America Will Never Be The New Saudi Swing America is never going to be in a position to produce enough liquids to perform the role of swing producer in the oil world. It might notionally overtake Saudi production by 2017, but that hardly leaves it much export margin to play with. U.S. pricing ‘power’ will purely become a function of how much collateral damage it does to other producer states, not dictating how much consumers have to pay at the pumps.
World War II ended 65 years ago. The Cold War disappeared 21 years ago. Yet America's military deployments have little changed. Nowhere is that more evident than on the Japanese island of Okinawa. Okinawans are tired of the heavy U.S. military presence. Some 90,000 — nearly 10 percent of the island's population — gathered in protest at the end of April. It is time for Washington to lighten Okinawa's burden. An independent kingdom swallowed by imperial Japan, Okinawa was the site of a brutal battle as the United States closed in on Japan in early 1945. After Tokyo's surrender, Washington filled the main prefecture island with bases and didn't return it to Japan until 1972. America's military presence has only been modestly reduced since. The facilities grew out of the mutual defense treaty between America and Japan, by which the former promised to defend the latter, which was disarmed after its defeat. The island provided a convenient home for American units. Most Japanese people also preferred to keep the U.S. military presence on Japan's most distant and poorest province, forcing Okinawans to carry a disproportionate burden of the alliance. Whatever the justifications of this arrangement during the Cold War, the necessity of both U.S. ground forces in Japan and the larger mutual defense treaty between the two nations has disappeared. It's time to reconsider both Tokyo's and Washington's regional roles. The United States imposed the so-called "peace constitution" on Japan, Article 9 of which prohibits the use of force and even creation of a military. However, American officials soon realized that Washington could use military assistance. Today's "Self-Defense Force" is a widely accepted verbal evasion of a clear constitutional provision. Nevertheless, both domestic pacifism and regional opposition have discouraged reconsideration of Japan's military role. Washington's willingness to continue defending an increasingly wealthy Japan made a rethink unnecessary.
In Part III of this Essay, I will argue that the Court's actions in the first year of the Obama administration are cut from the same cloth as its decision to intervene in Bush-era disputes. As this section has suggested, the Court has never risked national security or executive branch non-acquiescence in its enemy combatant decision making. Moreover, as I argued in Part I, Court decision making in this area has largely tracked social and political forces. For reasons I will now detail, the Court's decisions both to steer clear of this issue in the spring and summer of 2009 and its fall 2009 decision to hear the Uighur petition match past Court practices. Throughout the enemy combatant dispute, the Court has found ways to expand its authority without risking an institutionally costly backlash.¶ III. Conclusion: The Past Is Prologue¶ Supreme Court interventions in the enemy combatant disputes never pushed the limits of what was acceptable to the political [*523] branches of government. The Court, instead, maximized its authority by moving incrementally and expanding judicial power in ways generally acceptable to the political branches. This was true of Bush-era decision making and there is no reason to think that the Court will depart from past practices during the Obama administration.¶ Consider, for example, the Court's March 2009 decision to back away from a case involving Bush administration efforts to detain a legal resident without charges. After agreeing - in December 2008 - to hear a challenge to the Bush administration's detention of Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri at a South Carolina Navy brig, the Court sided with the Obama administration and removed the case from its docket. n170 The administration had claimed the case was moot because - in February 2009 - it formally filed federal criminal charges against al-Marri (so that he would be tried in federal court and not held indefinitely at a military base). n171 Mr. Marri's lawyers objected, arguing (unsuccessfully) that the administration could subsequently relocate him to a military base and, consequently, the Court should still resolve his legal challenge. n172¶ The Court's decisions to hear and then moot al-Marri are readily understandable. The Fourth Circuit had upheld the Bush administration in al-Marri and - when agreeing to hear the case - the Justices had good reason to slap down the Bush administration for their continuing efforts to sidestep federal court review over enemy combatant policy-making. Not only had the Court taken a strong stand in favor of judicial review in Boumediene and other decisions, but the November 2008 election of Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress further solidified the Court's position with elected officials and the American people. And, with none of the eighteen amicus briefs in the case supporting the Bush administration, n173 a Court ruling against [*524] Bush administration actions would have further buoyed the Court's status with academics and other interest groups. By March 2009, however, there was no good reason to ask the new administration to sort out its views on the al-Marri detention. Candidate Obama had campaigned against the Bush administration efforts to fence out federal courts from war-on-terror litigation. Indeed, when asking the Court to moot the case, the Obama administration told the Justices that it was willing to have the Fourth Circuit ruling vacated (showing "that the government is not attempting to preserve its victory while evading review"). n174 Against this backdrop, there was simply no reason for the Justices to force the Obama administration to formally disavow or embrace Bush administration legal arguments. An Obama administration decision disavowing Bush administration arguments would not strengthen the Court's position vis-a-vis the executive (as the Obama Justice Department had already conceded the Court's authority to vacate the lower court ruling); an administration decision supporting Bush administration arguments would set the stage for a costly battle between the Court and the new administration. A decision on the merits, moreover, would have opened the Court up to charges of judicial over-reaching. In its brief seeking to moot al-Marri, the government argued that keeping the case alive "would lead only to an advisory opinion with no real-world impact on any individual" and that the Court should not reach out to decide "in a hypothetical posture" "complex constitutional questions" about the line where "national security policy and the Constitution intersect." n175¶ The Court's participation in Kiyemba likewise displays the Court's sensitivity to its status vis-a-vis the other branches and to the risks of unnecessarily interjecting itself in national security policy. This was true of both the June 2009 decision to hold over the appeal of the Uighur petitioners and the October 2009 decision to hear the case (but to schedule oral arguments so as to delay any decision until the summer of 2010). n176¶ June 2009 was too early for the Court to enter this dispute. Even though petitioners cast the case as an opportunity for the Court to defend its turf (suggesting that Boumediene had become an empty shell and it was up to the Court to give meaning to the decision), n177 [*525] the Court well understood the costs of entering this dispute. At that time, the Obama administration and Democratic Congress were sorting out their policy priorities on Guantanamo, Bagram detainees, and much more. Correspondingly, the Court had reason to think that a ruling demanding the relocation of Uighur detainees to the United States would not sit well with either the administration or Congress. Not only did the Obama administration oppose the relocation of the Uighurs to the United States, n178 Congress enacted legislation in June 2009 that severely limited the President's power to move Guantanamo detainees to the United States or resettle them in another country. n179¶ By holding the issue over, however, the Court gave the Obama administration time both to sort out its policy priorities and to relocate the Uighur detainees (and, in so doing, to try to moot the case). n180 In its brief opposing certiorari, the Obama administration made clear that it was trying both to close Guantanamo and to relocate the Uighur petitioners and asked the Court to respect the "efforts of the political Branches to resolve issues relating to petitioners and other individuals located at Guantanamo Bay." n181 Furthermore, the decision to hold the case over bought the Court time to see how the enemy combatant issue would play out among politicians, interest groups, the media, and the American people. As Part I reveals, Court enemy combatant decisions track social and political forces. As Part II reveals, the Court has moved incrementally - advancing its authority to say "what the law is" without risking backlash or national security.¶ The Court's October 2009 decision to hear Kiyemba does not break from this pattern. By scheduling oral arguments for spring 2009, the Court both provided elected government with additional time to settle this issue and provided itself with an opportunity to calibrate its decision making against the backdrop of elected government action and other subsequent developments. n182 More than that, [*526] since Boumediene only decided the threshold issue that enemy combatants were entitled to habeas corpus relief, Kiyemba is a good vehicle for the Court to provide some details on how habeas proceedings should be conducted. In particular, there is little prospect that the decision will impact the rights on many Guantanamo detainees. By the summer of 2010, Guantanamo may be closed; if not, most detainees who prevail in habeas proceedings are likely to have been relocated to another country. Moreover, Kiyemba raises a quite narrow issue, namely, whether federal courts can mandate that Guantanamo detainees be relocated to the United States if no foreign nation will take them. n183 In other words, there is next to no prospect that Kiyemba will result in the type of scrutinizing judicial review that might raise national security risks (assuming, of course, that the Court will rule against the administration). Instead, Kiyemba seems likely to further tighten judicial control over the executive - but only in a very modest way.¶ Throughout the course of its enemy combatant decision making, the Court has moved incrementally. In so doing, the Court has expanded its authority vis-a-vis the President. Obama administration efforts to moot al-Marri and to relocate Uighur detainees (thereby mooting that litigation) speak to the administration's desire to avoid Supreme Court rulings that might limit the scope of presidential power. Unlike the Bush administration (whose politically tone deaf arguments paved the way for anti-administration rulings), n184 the Obama administration understands that the Court has become a player in the enemy combatant issue.¶ What is striking here, is that the Court never took more than it could get - it carved out space for itself without risking the nation's security or political backlash. Its 2004 and 2006 rulings provided ample opportunity for the President to pursue his enemy combatant initiative. Its 2008 ruling in Boumediene, while clearly constraining the political branches, reflected the views of the new Democratic majority in Congress and (to a lesser extent) the views of presidential candidates Obama and McCain. n185 Its decision to steer clear of early Obama-era [*527] disputes likewise avoids the risks of a costly backlash while creating incentives for the  Obama administration to take judicial authority into account (by settling these cases outside of court). n186 Put another way, by taking prevailing social and political forces into account, the Court was able to flex its muscles without meaningfully undermining the policy preferences of the President and Congress.¶ I, of course, recognize that the Court's willingness to engage the executive and, in so doing, to nullify a signature campaign of the Bush administration, is a significant break from the judiciary's recent practice of steering clear of disputes tied to unilateral presidential war making. n187 At the same time, I see the Court's willingness to challenge, and not defer, as not at all surprising. The Bush administration made arguments that backed the Court into a corner. The Court could either bow at the altar of presidential power, or it could find a way to slap the President down. It is to be expected that the Court chose to find a way to preserve its authority to "say what the law is." n188 The Justices, after all, have incentives to preserve the Court's role in our system of checks and balances - especially when their decisions enhance their reputations with media and academic elites. n189 This is true of the Supreme Court in general, and arguably more true of the current Court - given its penchant to claim judicial supremacy and given the importance of these institutional concerns to the Court's so-called swing Justices. n190 It is also noteworthy that the enemy combatant cases were at the very core of the judicial function. At oral arguments in Hamdan, Justice Kennedy emphasized the importance of habeas corpus relief, n191 suggesting that limitations on habeas relief would "threaten[] the status of the judiciary as a co-equal partner of the legislature and the executive." n192¶ [*528] One final comment on the nature of the dialogue that took and is taking place between the three branches on the enemy combatant issue: Throughout the Bush-era, these cases were anything but a constitutional dialogue. The executive persisted in making the same argument, and, as its political fortunes diminished, the Court carved over more and more issue space for itself. For its part, the Bush-era Congress played no meaningful role - it simultaneously backed the executive while signaling to the Court that it would support judicial invalidation of executive initiatives. With a new administration in place, there is reason to think that the inter-branch dynamic will change. The Obama administration has advanced its policies while pursuing a less confrontational course; avoiding absolutist arguments and trying to steer clear of an adverse Supreme Court ruling. In so doing, the administration has yet to launch the type of broadsides that challenge the foundations of judicial authority. Up until now, the Court has responded in kind, leaving the administration breathing room to pursue its policies without a Supreme Court pronouncement on the scope of presidential power. It is a matter of pure speculation whether this pattern will continue. At the same time, there is good reason to think that the Court will follow the path it has laid down in Bush-era cases, taking social and political forces into account so as to protect its turf without risking national security or elected government backlash.
In addition to being clean and plentiful, wind also may bolster national security, since it's a distributed energy source. "It's not like a nuclear or coal power plant where you can target a single location," Jacobson says. "Turbines are distributed. You'd essentially have to destroy individual turbines separately."
NOAA made several attempts a decade ago to promote a national aquatic farming initiative that would cut through the red tape and set up a one-stop-shop for deep-water fish farming permits. Bills were introduced in Congress twice but were shot down due to opposition from entrenched fishing interests. While this sort of short-term protectionism is always politically popular, the reality is that domestic fisheries continue to shrink due to catch limitations. A thriving deep water aquaculture industry could provide sustainable jobs for old fishing communities, repurposing much of the fishing fleet and dockside infrastructure to handle the new business. Perhaps someday. As for now, Brian is focused on making his venture a success in a country that still understands the value of economic freedom.
CONCLUSION: THE NEUROSIS &amp; NIHILISM OF A ‘LIFE’ AGAINST LIFE. This is why Lacan proposes that his enquiry into ethics must be one to go “more deeply into the notion of the real”(LE:11). Further into what he would rather call the real, given that previous notions of ‘nature’ have been too far ‘different’––from being far too Platonic––than his own; and because it’s the very exclusions in these previous notions which upon return, as return of excess, are yielding our most tragic problems. Today when faced with problems of the magnitude of global warming––a special but by no means solo case of adverse environment change at present due to our physical treatment of the planet––we often think the answer is to be more moral, more good, and we are thankful when exponents of the Good in some way bring attention to the problem. However, the idea of the Good as introduced by Plato, and nigh all of its descendants whether secular, rationalist, religious or not, continue to predicate themselves on a radically false picture of the human-condition: if not still of the entire cosmos––which only then lines itself up aside of an age- old repression, a repression of das Ding, that Freudian Thing in our inner real which, when it returns after being disavowed and denied in the name of the Good too long, is even more devastating. Presently we are accelerating along the path of what Lacan discloses as our civilisation’s “race towards destruction”, a “massive destruction”, “a resurgence of savagery”, snaking the paths traced out before us by the centuries long dominion of Western morality [51]; and the nihilism detected by Nietzsche before the turn of the 20th has never threatened to reach such the grand finale. But what I would have us take from this enquiry here is that this is not because we aren’t in accordance enough with a moral ideal of the Sovereign good, but rather, it’s because we aren’t in accordance enough with a proper understanding of the real. It’s because we still at some level think that being more moral, in accordance with the Good’s inherited repressive structures towards our drives, desire, and truthfulness about the real, is actually the answer to––rather than the source of––our most tragic problems. The goal here is by no means then to encourage all to let their Things run wild––which would probably be nothing short of an instant conflagration––but this is why and precisely why we must desist from deluding ourselves under the tightening grip of a Sovereign Good, for this is precisely the move which cuts the Thing loose after pressing down for far too long, a slippery hand’s palming on the coils of a spring, forever readying the subsequent explosion. For when that which is really real––as opposed to what Christian-Platonism falsely called the ‘real’––is forced from mind, it can’t really disappear because it is real, and it tends to end up only in our gun-sights as an imaginary overlaying of an external other, when the signifier ‘enmity’ appears. The earth itself can even seem like the enemy after while, one which like Plato in his Phaedo, we might think then to escape from “as if from a prison”, and especially from “the bonds of the body”, in the hope that we may live one day without the earthly altogether[52]. Following such negations to their logical conclusion, life itself becomes enemy too, for as being made up of the earthly and organic, life could never be free of what it is in essence. And what is the death-drive Freud tells from the start, if not to return us sundry to that dust-bowl of the inorganic; as per that “second death”[53] fantasm Lacan salvages from the Monstre de Sade, which wills to go beyond the destruction of mere beings, by destroying too the principle from which fresh sets could emerge. Such negative devaluations of our earthly, organic life though are really of our own construction: as de Sade, like any pervert, is only the mirror which shows expressed what Platonic- neurotics are but hide inside––a cess-pit of loathing contempt for life, built up from the unconscious and disowned, distorted and damned up, built up, instinctual-ideational elements of their own subjective psyches, phobically ferocious of that Thingly real lying not so dormant, and readying within… But is it now still possible as Nietzsche teaches to say ‘Yes’ to the real of nature both   without and within––to return to it!––even though it is more frightful and we are less guaranteed protection of it than the Platonic history of metaphysicians taught? For with the further disclosures of The Ethics of Psychoanalysis––Lacan’s following up and extension of the meta-ethical implications of Freud: perhaps even Nietzsche, our great intellectual übermensch, may too have bitten off more snake- head than he could chew? From certain moments in Nietzsche’s texts we can perhaps interpret that he may have had this Thing in his sights, but saw nothing much to come of it, so instead, elected to turn away, though not without some perhaps hinted at self- amusement.[54] But with psychoanalysis, rightly or wrongly, such truths are out. It doesn’t seem all positive at first, and perhaps it never entirely will. But we must not let this deeper disclosure desist us now from the core Nietzschean project of locating and overcoming the nihilism which begs us to take cover in idealising fictions, as if life as life is not worth living. Not because nihilism and the annihilation of the species is wrong in the sense of being immoral, but rather because it is bad art, mediocre art, and the ‘knowledge’ claims it trumpets on should only make us flare. If we are at our full intellectual and creative will to power, we can only consider such cultural-civil regressions as we saw on display with that whole propaganda comedy that surrounded the war for more oil in Iraq as infantile; the hapless results of sibling rivalries gone too far astray. But we must also resist being caught up in the imaginary of those who would only re-preach to us now of a return to the Good, who would only redeploy such versions of nihilism’s precursory defensive fictions, the pernicious ones, which would only then re-falsify our data, and leave us disappointed when the truth then re-emerges. Doing more harm than good does Platonism in the end by leaving us untrained for the real, with the habit instead to take some truth as ‘error’, and error as ‘truth’––as ‘real’––to the point even of epistemic dysfunction. Take the grotesque intellectual poverty of that whole Christian middle-ages for example, whence put into relation with the heights of Aristotle and his fellow Greeks, as Augustine and Aquinas amplified some of the worst bits of Platonism, and threw the rest into abyss. The overcoming of the moralising good of Christian-Platonism though does by no means imply then a subsequent affirmation of all that brutal Roman like greed, slavery, decadence, circus-bread corruption and mindless colonial expansion that we’ve heard all about, and are hardly so free of with our corporate today––just ask a Latin-American for instance![55] For it is possible within the perspectives opened up by Nietzsche, Freud, Lacan, as Silvia Ons puts it, to view a social-historical or individual neurosis of any kind: including the expressed acted-out, perverse-sadistic form that escapes when the Good is temporarily loosed of its repressive grip––and say to the would be Platonist: ‘No, not that, that’s not a cure, that’s a mirage; that’s sheer fantasy, resentment, spite; that’s not a cure it will only make things worse; worse in a different way, but worse nonetheless!’ By greater mindfulness then, with guided affirmation towards even that fearsome Freudian Thing that The Ethics of Psychoanalysis has us find now in our inner natures: we can eventually again say ‘Yes’-to-life in such the way that it overcomes the nihilism of not caring too much whether we as individuals or species live or die, whether we as culture or civilisation advance or decline. But we can only do this with fullest efficacy by freeing ourselves of all that wasted neurosis sickness that feels it must deny our Thing like aspect of the real: because from all those Christian-Platonic prejudices of the Good, it has been taught that such ‘things’ are too far beneath it. We must continue instead to train ourselves to stare the real directly in the face, without flinching, and that’s all we can do at least to start. For unless we can continue to utilise, sublimate, enjoy and get a positive, well-guided jouissance out of all aspects of life––including that Freudian Ding in our real––then the chances are we’re going to be at least in part, happy enough in no longer living it: offering not even a puff of genuine political praxis! We either face up to the death-drive snaking long beneath the dank, hidden history of the un-real, anti-real Good of Platonism––or let the disowned, un-understood drive resurge of its own volition until it accidentally finishes us!s Ethics, May 1960.
His message that day was simple: The country needs to use more renewable energy, and companies like solar-panel maker Ausra need tax credits to lure more investment. What the Senate Democratic leader didn't mention was how hard it's been to persuade Congress to renew those clean energy tax credits before they expire at the end of the year. It's a story hundreds of companies, unions and environmental groups know well after months spent lobbying Congress to renew the tax incentives. Few, if any, lawmakers oppose the credits. What's frustrating clean energy supporters is the battle over how to pay for them.
If pictures tell the tale, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, so famous their last names need not be mentioned, had a marvelous time on their recent trip to Cuba, where they were trailed by starry-eyed fans, just as they are everywhere else they go. According to press accounts, they were forced to cut short a tour of Havana’s historic old city because they were surrounded by a swarm of thousands, and their security guards got nervous.¶ That just goes to show you that Fidel Castro’s efforts to wall off the island nation from his powerful enemy to the north have failed miserably. He and his brother have perfected the dark arts of the dictatorship — jailing dissidents, stifling protest, controlling internal news media, severely restricting travel abroad — but the lights of the outside world shine brightly through the cracks.¶ Castro’s long-running tyranny has not managed the thoroughgoing isolation of, say, North Korea, where citizens have little realistic knowledge of the rest of the world.¶ Still, Castro has his accomplices here in the United States — fanatics who would help him wall off Cuba, restrict the access its citizens have to American culture and generally thwart a hoped-for transition from dictatorship to democracy. Bizarrely, those accomplices consider themselves Castro’s biggest enemies. They have dedicated themselves to his demise.¶ Indeed, if you know about the recent trip to Cuba by America’s First Couple of Pop, you probably heard about it through the controversy ginned up by a handful of Florida Republicans: Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart. Without waiting to investigate the trip, Ros-Lehtinen and Diaz-Balart, especially, began complaining that it was likely a violation of the antediluvian U.S. embargo.¶ As it turns out, Beyoncé and Jay-Z entered Cuba legally. They went as part of a cultural and educational exchange arranged under the auspices of a group called Academic Arrangements Abroad and approved by the U.S. Treasury Department, according to Reuters. But the Florida pols didn’t want facts; they wanted to embarrass President Obama by implicating two high-profile political supporters in something nefarious.¶ It’s the anti-Castro faction who should be embarrassed. The Cuban embargo is dumb, one of the most antiquated and least sensible federal laws remaining on the books. Enacted in the early 1960s, it is a remnant of a different time — an era of bobby socks, segregation and a serious threat emanating from the Soviet Union.¶ The Cuban embargo makes no more sense today than laws requiring white and “colored” water fountains. It is kept alive by a handful of powerful politicians of Cuban heritage, who cling to their parents’ and grandparents’ bitterness toward Castro. Many members of Cuba’s affluent classes fled the island after Castro’s 1959 revolution, when he began nationalizing private industries and strengthening ties with the Soviets.¶ His long-running dictatorship has been an economic disaster and a catastrophe for civil liberties. But with the Soviets long gone, Castro represents absolutely no threat to the United States. Further, the most promising avenue for changing Cuba lies in courting it, not cutting it off.¶ When Richard Nixon visited China in 1972, ending a 25-year breach, he did so with a similar notion in mind. China remains a Communist country. It has a totalitarian government; it restricts human rights; as a nuclear power with a huge military, it could pose a threat to the United States and its allies. Yet, no reasonable politician suggests that the U.S. government should restrict travel or commerce with China. For decades, our government has believed the best way to change China is through engagement.¶ Using that standard, President Bill Clinton sought to weaken the Cuban embargo during his term by encouraging educational and cultural exchanges. Though President George W. Bush stopped them, Obama has revived the trips. While the sensible policy would be to end the embargo, the cultural exchanges are at least a step in the right direction.
The bwa's goals were three-fold. First, like other Black feminist organizations founded later on, the bwa aimed to dispel the myth of the Black matriarchy. Their second goal was to reevaluate the oppression of Black women in slavery. Countering "the widespread concept that by some miracle, the oppression of slavery for the black woman was not as degrading, not as horrifying, not as barbaric as it had been for the black man," the bwa argued that, in a society where Black men were oppressed because of their race, Black women were "further enslaved by our sex." The bwa's third goal, to redefine the role of Black woman in revolutionary struggle, responded to the sexism of Black Nationalist rhetoric, which, while it elevated Black women to a pedestal as "African Queens," also called for their subservience to Black men. In recounting the history of the organization, the twwa collective illuminates the contradictions in nationalist rhetoric: "Now we noticed another thing. And that is, with the rise of nationalism and the rejection of white middle class norms and values, that this rejection of whiteness..took a different turn when it came to the black woman. That is, black men began defining the role of black women in the movement. They stated that our role was a supportive one, others stated that we must become breeders and provide an army; still others stated that we had Kotex or pussy power" (Third World Women's Alliance 1972, 8).¶ Beal recalls that former sncc members in bwa viewed genuflection to male power as contradictory and absurd. They did not bow to the violence of Alabama State Troopers in the South, so why did Black nationalist men think that Black women would submit to patriarchy from anyone, be it in Black organizations or in the bedroom? (Beal 1997). The bwa recognized the contradictions in redefining Blackness based on sexist ideas about family and sex roles including following the white patriarchal nuclear family. It called, instead, for "a true revolutionary movement [that] must enhance the status of women."
Acid rain has been a fully realized ecological problem for only a few decades. The effects of acid rain have been recorded in the eastern United States, Great Britain, Germany, and elsewhere. More recently, acid rain is becoming a significant problem in China, Japan, and other rapidly industrializing nations like India and Taiwan. Scientists fear the negative effects will continue to worsen unless governments and industries work together. Acid rain can affect bodies of water by increasing the acidity until fish and marine vegetation can no longer survive. As acidity rises, forms of aquatic life struggle to survive. At pH 5.5, bottom-dwelling bacterial decomposers start to disappear, leaving organic debris to collect. In such cases, plankton, the base of the aquatic system, lack its food source, negatively affecting all marine life. Further, if the composed leaf litter problem persists, toxic metals such as aluminum and mercury can be released and seep into the groundwater. At pH levels of 4.5 and below, nearly all aquatic life will die. Acid rain also greatly affects forests and soil by washing away vital nutrients and replacing them with harmful toxins. Some of the great forests in Germany and western Europe are believed to be dying from acid deposition, which is a result of a combination of wet and dry acid pollution. Scientists believe essential nutrients for plant life are washed away by acid rain, which can also affect crop yields. During this process, toxic metals are transferred from the atmosphere to forests. These deposits of lead, zinc, copper, chromium, and aluminum, among others, retard growth of local plant life, as well as mosses, algae, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and fungi, all of which contribute to the health of forests.
The advantages of enclosed photobioreactors are obvious.¶ They can overcome the problems of contamination¶ and evaporation encountered in open ponds (Molina¶ Grima et al. 1999). The biomass productivity of photobioreactors¶ can average 13 times more than that of¶ a traditional raceway pond. Harvest of biomass from¶ photobioreactors is less expensive than from raceway¶ ponds, because the typical algal biomass is about 30¶ times as concentrated as the biomass found in raceways¶ (Chisti 2007).
It’s only March, but it now seems clear that for service to the industry, the winner of European Shale Gas Man of the Year will go to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. It’s hard to know who is more surprised: Putin, the EU or Russian investors. It wasn’t meant to be like this. Putin forgot EU gas import dependency is matched by Russian export dependency. Gazprom has the pipeline export monopoly and only opened up LNG exports to include Novatek in 2013. Within Russia there are many oil and gas producers, but Gazprom, as direct descendant of USSR Ministry of Gas Industry, and still 38% owned by the Russian Federation, has the monopoly of exports. This from Oxford Institute of Energy Studies from a couple of weeks ago is as up to date as one can get: Sberbank estimates that Gazprom generated $162 billion of total revenues in 2013,34 meaning that gas exports to Europe as a whole accounted for 39% of this and exports through Ukraine for around 20%. Gazprom’s overall reliance on gas exports has been reduced over the past decade as the company has diversified into oil (via GazpromNeft), power generation and other related businesses. Nevertheless, the company would clearly be hit very hard by any interruption to its European exports. It’s ironic that the OIES was until recently thought of as being too conservative and too eager to highlight the major role Russian gas played in European energy to the exclusion of LNG and shale gas. But their point today is that one could almost say that the last thing anyone want’s to do is what Russia, and Gazprom, has just done: revealing yourself as unreliable and expensive makes customers seek alternatives: If Gazprom were seen as a reliable supplier, rather than as a tool of the Russian government, it wouldn’t be so vulnerable to competition. Of course, former K.G.B. agents aren’t known for their respect for market forces, and Putin cares far more about using Russian power than about Gazprom’s profits. But he’s about to find out that, when you’re running an authoritarian petrostate, energy profits are power: Russia depends on oil and gas revenue to fund its imperial ambitions and maintain stability at home. Alienating customers and giving competitors an opening isn’t just bad business. It’s bad politics. Putin likes to think of himself as a geopolitical grandmaster. But when it comes to natural gas he isn’t thinking enough moves ahead. Putin certainly chose the wrong winter, but I guess he couldn't have spoilt the Sochi Games. Unlike the 30 year record low winter in the US, it has been very mild in Europe and as a result, Europe’s gas storage is already 45% full at time where it normally would be empty. It would be easy enough to reach 100% with Norwegian, Algerian or LNG supplies alone over the lower use summer season. People forget that the simplified reason behind storage is that gas flows out of holes in the ground at the same pressure in January or July. Therefore it has to go somewhere and gas storage is the answer. Russia could actually stop selling gas to Europe and no one would be any the wiser, or colder, until next winter. Russia would immediately notice the difference in the bank, which is why they don't want to interrupt supply. That presents an interesting possibility that is making the rounds in Brussels, Washington and NATO circles. One has to understand that after the 2006/09 Russia/Ukraine disputes, other things have changed, quite apart from shale and LNG. Europe’s total gas demand is 10% below the peak as Europe burns more coal, renewables displace small, but noticeable, gas volumes and the economy has soured.The EU has also got Norway as even more reliable supplier eating more and more into what Russia considered a captive market. LNG of course has been already been disrupted by the evaporation of US demand, increasing the pool of suppliers. LNG is complex but essentially, if Europe was going to pay the price, which is still likely to be less than Russian gas is (or was), there’s plenty of gas sloshing around. In short, “Russia needs Europe more than Europe needs Russia.” Those words were spoken by David Cameron of all people in Brussels but the point was made explicit by US State Department Special Envoy for Energy Affairs Carlos Pascual: Russian gas giant Gazprom may lose the European energy market, since Europe can buy 160 billion cubic meters of gas from alternative sources – the exact amount it purchased from Gazprom in 2013, according to Carlos Pasqual, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine (2000-2003) and the State Department’s Special Envoy for Energy Affairs. Energy analysts believe the European Union’s initiative on reducing reliance on Gazprom is serious. Paqual, speaking during a press conference at the Ukrainian Crisis Media Center on March 21, estimated that over the next several years “at least 80-90 billion cubic meters of gas could enter the European market through new sources from Australia, Mozambique, Algeria, and other countries, while the U.S. government recently approved six new drilling licenses that could add yet another 80 billion.” The last refers to the US LNG export story, a favourite of Republican Senators back home even as it ignores the fact that permitting exports and achieving them via terminals are two different things. Back to Brussels, and moving away from energy, initial fears that Europe, and specifically Germany and the UK ,would be too eager to give in to Russian blackmail have been proven wrong. Merkel seems to have given up on diplomacy, stating Putin is out of it. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told Mr. Obama by telephone on Sunday that after speaking with Mr. Putin she was not sure he was in touch with reality, people briefed on the call said. “In another world,” she said. The reality, which both Putin and many energy “experts” including green enablers like EcoFin didn’t see coming, is that Brussels now thinks if push came to shove, they could do without Russian gas. Not only that, there is a new toughness in Europe that surprises themselves as much as anyone. Expect to hear a strange sound we thought we would never hear again: European sabre rattling. While no one is shooting, expect to see, if Putin wants it, various troop movements into the Baltics and Poland to match the Russian “exercises” near eastern Ukraine. Obama was heading to Brussels this week anyway to visit the EU. Significantly, he’s now going across town to NATO HQ as well. But at the same time, there may be a more useful form of pre-emptive strike: A European gas buyers strike. Why wait for Russia to have the upper hand over supply in the event of a serious winter in 2014/15? Storage can only go up to 100% and that’s easy to reach in spring and summer from non-Russian sources. But cutting off the cash now will have a more immediate impact on Russia. US and European financial sanctions are already starting to hurt. Recommended: Key world markets to see big changes. Get in-depth reports FREE. Europe can comfortably do without Russian gas for the rest of the year. In fact, we may even save money compared to Russian prices and save the cash for any possible LNG spikes this winter. Could Russia do without European money so easily? Let's cut them off first when they are more vulnerable instead of giving them billions to put us over a gas pipe next year. In the big game in Putin’s mind, he can simply switch to China. But that’s as fanciful a notion as those LNG Liberty Tankers unloading on the beach. Russia and China have been talking gas deals for years, agreeing on everything apart from that little matter of price. But, in a yet another own goal for FC Kremlin, China will get an even better gas price now they realise they have VV Putin in a judo hold. "With Western sanctions, the atmosphere could change quickly in favor of China” Going back to shale, the Brussels meeting is reconvening in June with some concrete plans to change the energy mix. Russia has shown itself to be unreliable and expensive. That’s not a good combination in any business and Europeans will now rush to get gas from various sources including, starting at the end of 2015, US LNG. The US LNG is only available thanks to shale and if they aren’t yet saying much on shale in public, even Merkel and Hollande understand the contradiction that buying US shale while banning our own is irrational. It's going to be interesting to see the Green reaction here. We may get the chance, albeit unwillingly for most, to see one of their pet theories in practice: Radical demand reduction. We certainly shall see proof that a rapid rise in renewables is as fanciful as instant LNG. Unfortunately, we may also see what it is allegedly being considered in the UK: The suspension of the large coal fired power station closures planned for next year. If the UK government hadn't been shaken by the combination of green complaints and inconsequential earthquakes, to preclude Cuadrilla's shale gas plans, the UK at least would be facing the possibility of domestic shale gas supplies coming on line this winter, instead of 2016/17. Even after the multi year obsession and enabling of the "risk" industry, we missed one of the greatest gambles of all: supply won't even show up.
The task of feminist ethics is to make visible the¶ experiences of women in moral theory. Feminist¶ discoursive ethics argues that the 'generalized other'¶ should be completed by the 'concrete other' to take¶ into account experiences of women and their conception¶ of self. Thus, besides the principle of egalitarian¶ reciprocity, which concentrates on the social and¶ ecological compatibility, we have to recognize the¶ principle of 'complementary reciprocity' to make¶ possible a 'communicative ethics of need interpretation'¶ (Benhabib, 1986).¶ The ethical theory of the economic foundations¶ and its feminist critique help us to identify as a main¶ foundation of the present economic system what we¶ call maintenance economy. In this paper we define¶ maintenance economy as productive and creative¶ (reproductive) activities that are carried out without payment of money. To these belong ecological processes¶ as well as the maintenance of social and¶ physical relations that are indispensable for human¶ existence and which we call caring activities. In our¶ society these numerous caring activities are mainly¶ carried out by women. Our hypothesis is that any understanding of the¶ maintenance economy is the basis for an understanding¶ of economic activities as a whole (Busch-Liity et¶ al., 1994; Biesecker, 1992). We have to take into¶ account the fundamental impact of this realm for any¶ economic and other human activity. Traditional¶ economists often fail to notice the importance of this¶ maintenance economy for every economic system.¶ The ethical theory of economic foundations in its¶ broadened view helps us to make this impact visible.¶ By rewriting economics from an ethical and feminist¶ perspective against the background of the ecological¶ and social crisis, we will get necessary insights to¶ redesign the socio-politicai structures towards a better future for women, men, and children.
Donald Trump is the champion of outsourcing to nemesis countries he has attacked and does attack, particularly Mexico. But Donald Trump has a blind eye to people brought here to work with work visas (H-2B) for the hospitality industry in particular. In doing so, he is infuriating many of his core supporters, especially of the paid anti-immigrant “professionals.” Not only has his own company hired thousands of imported immigrant laborers for Florida’s Mar De Lago, particularly from Romania, but his administration has just announced that over and above the congressionally-mandated annual cap of 66,000 H-2B temporary work visas it is issuing 15,000 more for immediate use to expire September 30. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly made the announcement of the 23 percent increase that he is allowed to make. He said it was temporary to help American business. The decision was jointly made by Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Labor. The departments say that the harm that some businesses face if they don’t find workers is greater than the harm American workers could face if someone participates in the program fraudulently or at all. Businesses that apply for the 15,000 visas must prove they will suffer “irreparable harm” if they are not able to hire temporary foreign labor. Imagine seasonally affected agricultural businesses trying to apply for these visas after the country has reached its threshold and you can understand the burden the Trump administration has placed on businesses. But this move has infuriated Trump’s most outspoken anti-immigrant supporters. In short, Trump has unleashed the wrath of a cluster of organizations connected to or founded by Michigan doctor John Tanton. The polite word used by much of the media for Tanton’s groups are “immigration restrictionist.”
In Wyoming, as in other states, lawmakers and public officials are elected in part to manage the state's finances. This includes generating revenues (money coming into the state from various sources) and approving expenditures (the money spent on governmental functions and servicing state debt). State budgets are complex and fluid, as they depend on anticipated revenues and planned expenditures, which may alter over the course of a fiscal year. If revenues do not keep pace with expenditures, states generally have to raise taxes, cut services, borrow money, or a combination of the three. State budget decisions are also influenced by policy decisions at the national level, such as the Affordable Care Act or energy and environmental regulations, and issues at the local level, such as crime and the quality of education.
Perhaps one of the most alarming measures that the TPP will implement will be the further destruction of the U.S. manufacturing sector, as the TPP will send even more manufacturing jobs overseas. Furthermore, very little is known about the agreement. The negotiations have been taking place in secret and very few of the details have been unveiled to the public. Like other trade agreements before it, such as NAFTA and the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement (KOR-US), the TPP is being advertised to the U.S. as a means to improve our economy and increase exports. However, if the disastrous effects of NAFTA are any indication, TPP will only serve to further cripple our industrial base. America has already experienced the destruction of our manufacturing capabilities with NAFTA, a “free trade” agreement that saw much of our manufacturing industry outsourced to foreign nations. If our leaders – primarily President Obama – continues to ram the TPP into law, then surely the United States will fall victim to even more economic destruction. Another scary thing about this particular agreement is that the one’s leading the negotiations and gathering support aren’t even taking into account or listening to what the People of the U.S. want. The U.S. public knows how damaging “free trade” agreements are, but those taking part in the TPP negotiations don’t care. They’re too busy working to appease corrupt corporations and other 1%-ers who stand to benefit financially from the TPP.
On the question of international law relative to outer space, specifically the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, that law is permissive relative to properly licensed and regulated commercial endeavors. Under the 1967 Treaty, lunar resources can be extracted and owned, but national sovereignty cannot be asserted over the mining area. If the Moon Agreement of 1979, however, is ever submitted to the Senate for ratification, it should be deep sixed.
Climate change killed the dinosaurs. Will it kill us as well? Will we let it destroy the human race? This was the grim, depressing message that hung in the background of the Climate Change Forum hosted on Friday by the Philippine National Red Cross at the Manila Hotel. "Not one dinosaur is alive today. Maybe someday it will be our fossils that another race will dig up in the future, " said Roger Bracke of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, underscoring his point that no less than extinction is faced by the human race, unless we are able to address global warming and climate change in this generation. Bracke, however, countered the pessimistic mood of the day by saying that the human race still has an opportunity to save itself. This more hopeful view was also presented by the four other speakers in the forum. Bracke pointed out that all peoples of the world must be involved in two types of response to the threat of climate change: mitigation and adaptation. "Prevention" is no longer possible, according to Bracke and the other experts at the forum, since climate change is already happening. Last chance The forum's speakers all noted the increasing number and intensity of devastating typhoons--most recently cyclone Nargis in Myanmar, which killed more than 100,000 people--as evidence that the world's climatic and weather conditions are turning deadly because of climate change. They also reminded the audience that deadly typhoons have also hit the Philippines recently, particularly Milenyo and Reming, which left hundreds of thousands of Filipino families homeless. World Wildlife Fund Climate and Energy Program head Naderev Saño said that "this generation the last chance for the human race" to do something and ensure that humanity stays alive in this planet. According to Saño, while most members of our generation will be dead by the time the worst effects of climate change are felt, our children will be the ones to suffer. How will Filipinos survive climate change? Well, first of all, they have to be made aware that climate change is a problem that threatens their lives. The easiest way to do this – as former Consultant for the Secretariats of the UN Convention on Climate Change Dr. Pak Sum Low told abs-cbnews.com/Newsbreak – is to particularize the disasters that it could cause. Talking in the language of destruction, Pak and other experts paint this portrait of a Philippines hit by climate change: increased typhoons in Visayas, drought in Mindanao, destroyed agricultural areas in Pampanga, and higher incidence rates of dengue and malaria. Sañom said that as polar ice caps melt due to global warming, sea levels will rise, endangering coastal and low-lying areas like Manila. He said Manila Bay would experience a sea level increase of 72 meters over 20 years. This means that from Pampanga to Nueva Ecija, farms and fishponds would be in danger of being would be inundated in saltwater. Sañom added that Albay, which has been marked as a vulnerable area to typhoons, would be the top province at risk. Sañom also pointed out that extreme weather conditions arising from climate change, including typhoons and severe droughts, would have social, economic and political consequences: Ruined farmlands and fishponds would hamper crop growth and reduce food sources, typhoons would displace people, cause diseases, and limit actions in education and employment. Thus, Saño said, while environmental protection should remain at the top of the agenda in fighting climate change, solutions to the phenomenon "must also be economic, social, moral and political." Mitigation Joyceline Goco, Climate Change Coordinator of the Environment Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, focused her lecture on the programs Philippine government is implementing in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. Goco said that the Philippines is already a signatory to global agreements calling for a reduction in the "greenhouse gasses"--mostly carbon dioxide, chloroflourocarbons and methane--that are responsible for trapping heat inside the planet and raising global temperatures. Goco said the DENR, which is tasked to oversee and activate the Clean Development Mechanism, has registered projects which would reduce methane and carbon dioxide. These projects include landfill and electricity generation initiatives. She also said that the government is also looking at alternative fuel sources in order do reduce the country's dependence on the burning of fossil fuels--oil--which are known culprits behind global warming. Bracke however said that mitigation is not enough. "The ongoing debate about mitigation of climate change effects is highly technical. It involves making fundamental changes in the policies of governments, making costly changes in how industry operates. All of this takes time and, frankly, we're not even sure if such mitigation efforts will be successful. In the meantime, while the debate goes on, the effects of climate change are already happening to us." Adaptation A few nations and communities have already begun adapting their lifestyles to cope with the effects of climate change. In Bangladesh, farmers have switched to raising ducks instead of chickens because the latter easily succumb to weather disturbances and immediate effects, such as floods. In Norway, houses with elevated foundations have been constructed to decrease displacement due to typhoons. In the Philippines main body for fighting climate change, the Presidential Task Force on Climate Change, (PTFCC) headed by Department on Energy Sec. Angelo Reyes, has identified emission reduction measures and has looked into what fuel mix could be both environment and economic friendly. The Department of Health has started work with the World Health Organization in strengthening its surveillance mechanisms for health services. However, bringing information hatched from PTFCC’s studies down to and crafting an action plan for adaptation with the communities in the barangay level remains a challenge. Bracke said that the Red Cross is already at the forefront of efforts to prepare for disasters related to climate change. He pointed out that since the Red Cross was founded in 1919, it has already been helping people beset by natural disasters. "The problems resulting from climate change are not new to the Red Cross. The Red Cross has been facing those challenges for a long time. However, the frequency and magnitude of those problems are unprecedented. This is why the Red Cross can no longer face these problems alone," he said. Using a medieval analogy, Bracke said that the Red Cross can no longer be a "knight in shining armor rescuing a damsel in distress" whenever disaster strikes. He said that disaster preparedness in the face of climate change has to involve people at the grassroots level. "The role of the Red Cross in the era of climate change will be less as a direct actor and increase as a trainor and guide to other partners who will help us adapt to climate change and respond to disasters," said Bracke. PNRC chairman and Senator Richard Gordon gave a picture of how the PNRC plans to take climate change response to the grassroots level, through its project, dubbed "Red Cross 143". Gordon explained how Red Cross 143 will train forty-four volunteers from each community at a barangay level. These volunteers will have training in leading communities in disaster response. Red Cross 143 volunteers will rely on information technology like cellular phones to alert the PNRC about disasters in their localities, mobilize people for evacuation, and lead efforts to get health care, emergency supplies, rescue efforts, etc.
For the first time, the Constitution acknowledged that state governments might violate constitutionally guaranteed rights. Accordingly, the legislative and judicial branches of federal government were empowered to remedy those violations. It is in that context that the U.S. Supreme Court was justified in preventing Florida state officials from denying equal protection to voters within and without the state. That was not mere activism — at least not in the sense of fabricating entitlements never grounded in the Constitution. Rather, it is judicial responsibility, allegiance to the law and to the Constitution, rooted securely in a theory of rights as propounded by our framers.
Lastly, the end of the Cold War has seen a strengthening of international and regional mechanisms of dispute resolution and conflict containment.46 In the African context, three mechanisms are salient. The first is United Nations peacekeeping. As Figure 7 shows, UN peacekeeping has grown remarkably in the size of missions in sub-Saharan Africa during the last twenty years and in the sophistication of mandates.47 In the past decade, almost every UN peacekeeping mission is deployed with a robust Chapter VII mandate, as opposed to more limited Chapter VI mandates, which were dominant in the 1990s and before. To be sure, one should not be naïve about the problems of peacekeeping.48 On the other hand, there has been learning in the organization, and empirically the missions are more frequent, more sophisticated, and larger than at any previous time. There are sound theoretical reasons to think UN peacekeeping may have an effect on conflict reduction.49 Second, African regional mechanisms are stronger. The African Union and regional organizations like ECOWAS have taken a greater interest in the prevention of armed conflict.50 In addition, in many cases African luminaries serve as ad hoc ambassadors of peace. In Kenya's 2007–8 crisis, for example, Kofi Annan was a key player; in Côte d'Ivoire's 2010–11 crisis, Raila Odinga and five African heads of state were quite active. South Africa plays an increasingly active role in settling African wars. Jerry Rawlings has emerged as an elder statesman. Critics question the decisions and effectiveness of these actors, but on balance their presence is greater than in previous periods of African international relations. Finally, international criminal justice mechanisms – from the ad hoc tribunals for Rwanda and Sierra Leone to the International Criminal Court – are stronger than ever before.51 Again, one may be circumspect about the strong deterrence claims of advocates, but on the other hand in some cases the implantation of these mechanisms correspond with a decline of warfare. On balance, it is reasonable to conclude that each of these mechanisms shapes the incentives – even marginally – of African decision makers in ways that limit the extent of warfare. They may not always work in every case, but they point to a stronger and strengthening international conflict reduction regime that has emerged since the end of the Cold War. The proposition clearly deserves greater empirical testing. But taken together with the diminished opportunities and incentives for civil war that followed the end of the Cold War,
2.8 Marine litter¶ The problem:¶ Litter is found in coastal areas and oceans across the world, even in remote places far from human population centres, dispersed by marine currents and wind. Litter in the marine environment:¶ · damages ecosystems and wildlife;¶ · threatens human health and safety,¶ · has a negative influence on the cultural, aesthetic and amenity values of society, and¶ · adversely affects economic activities such as tourism and fisheries.¶ Marine litter consists mainly of slowly degradable or non-degradable substances, which inevitably accumulate in the environment, causing an ever growing problem. It is difficult to estimate the total amount of marine litter in the oceans, but it is believed that around 70 per cent of litter entering the oceans lands on the seabed, 15 per cent on beaches and 15 per cent remains floating on the surface. Litter originates from two sources: Sea-based litter includes:¶ · trash from all manner of vessels;¶ · oils from offshore platforms or from boats and transport ships;¶ · refuse from aquaculture installations;¶ · discarded ships, fishing equipment and nets.¶ Land-based sources of litter include:¶ · municipal wastes from trash dumps, untreated sewage or storm water;¶ and the special category medical waste;¶ · various types of wastes from industrial installations and military activities;¶ · wastes originating from tourism and leisure activities (unep, 2005a).
Nothing has changed. The United States still exercises effective hegemony over the world economic and political system. China may occasionally resent that reality, but the benefits of participating in that system far outweigh the drawbacks. The agenda-setting power of the U.S. is visible in two recent Chinese economic reform initiatives: its consideration of joining the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and its request at the last Strategic and Economic Dialogue to re-open negotiations on the bilateral investment treaty (BIT) with the U.S. Chinese leaders know that to generate the productivity gains needed for sustained economic growth they must lower trade and investment barriers, and secure better access for Chinese firms to investment deals abroad. To achieve those goals, they must deepen their engagement in a trade and investment regime whose rules are largely determined by the United States.
All members of the Tohono O’odham tribe, whether U.S. or Mexican citizens, are entitled to access the reservation clinic overseen by the U.S. government. In practice, border policies prevent this. According to the Tohono O’odham Nation’s Resolution 98-063, passed in 1998, “enforcement of U.S. immigration laws has made it extremely difficult for all Tohono O’odham to continue their sovereign right to pass and re-pass the United States-Mexico border as we have done for centuries as our members are routinely stopped by the U.S. Border Patrol, while others have been actually ‘returned’ to Mexico even though enrolled.” Many O’odham in Mexico do not have the proper documentation now required to cross legally, whether birth certificates (lacking due to home births) or tribal IDs (because they lack the paperwork or witnesses required for enrollment).
If a future Republican president has the opportunity to replace Justice Ginsburg, the results could be no less consequential. Here’s a short list of decisions that would immediately become vulnerable if Ginsburg’s vote went to a conservative justice: No More Marriage Equality: United States v. Windsor — the decision striking down the unconstitutional Defense of Marriage Act — was a 5–4 decision with Ginsburg in the majority. If Ginsburg is replaced by another conservative, DOMA could roar back to life. At the very least, the nation’s drive towards nationwide marriage equality could come to a screeching halt. Criminalizing Sex: Although Lawrence v. Texas, which struck down Texas’ “sodomy” law, was a 6–3 decision, one of those six justices has since been replaced by the staunchly conservative Justice Samuel Alito. If another member of the Lawrence majority is replaced, it could lead to gay sex being outlawed entirely in several states. Lawrence’s holding, however extends far beyond gay couples to prohibit laws criminalizing non-commercial sexual activity between consenting adults. Thus, if Lawrence falls, the government could find its way into every American’s bedroom. The End of Abortion Rights: Roe v. Wade is already on life support. Indeed, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is the so-called swing vote on abortion, hasn’t voted to strike a law restricting the right to choose in 21 years. Nevertheless, Kennedy provided the key fifth vote to retain “the essential holding of Roe v. Wade” in a case called Planned Parenthood v. Casey. If Ginsburg is replaced by a conservative, there will likely be only four votes willing to retain that holding. Watering Down Minority Votes: Five justices voted in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry to strike part of a Texas redistricting map because it tried to protect an incumbent Republican congressman by reducing the impact of Latino voters. If Ginsburg is replaced by a conservative, these kinds of tactics could become common. Executing Children & The Intellectually Disabled: There are almost certainly four votes on the Supreme Court to permit executions of children and the intellectually disabled. Ginsburg’s replacement could be the fifth. Judges for Sale: Four justices joined a dissent arguing that there’s nothing wrong with a wealthy businessman spending $3 million to place a judge on a state supreme court — only to have that judge cast the key vote to overturn a $50 million verdict against the businessman’s company. Ginsburg’s replacement could places judges up for sale. Millions Without Health Care: Finally, the decision that largely preserved the Affordable Care Act was a 5–4 decision, with four justices voting to repeal Obamacare in its entirety. If those four justices gain a fifth vote, it could not only strip millions of Americans of the health insurance that they will soon gain under this law, but it could toss the entire American health care system into chaos. Among other things, if the dissent’s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety were to actually happen, Medicare could lose its ability to pay claims until the agency that administers the program completed a lengthy rulemaking process that can take months.
The first article, from the good folks over at Breaking Defense, discusses the well-worn subject in defense circles revolving around China striking U.S. forces first in a possible conflict—namely a massive conventional strike (most scholars argue by missiles of various types). The scary part according to the piece: “Because China believes it is much weaker than the United States, they are more likely to launch a massive preemptive strike in a crisis.” Yikes.¶ The second article is brought to us by distinguished University of Pennsylvania Professor Avery Goldstein courtesy of Foreign Affairs. Goldstein explains that “For at least the next decade, while China remains relatively weak compared to the United States, there is a real danger that Beijing and Washington will find themselves in a crisis that could quickly escalate to military conflict.”¶ Some heavy stuff for sure. To be fair to both pieces, I would encourage Flashpoints readers to look at the finer points of both articles—there is a lot to absorb beyond these few points I bring to your attention. ¶ Indeed, the idea of escalation and preemptive strikes by China has been discussed in various circles for several years now. For numerous reasons that scholars consider, such as history, the current nature of military technology or the various arguments made by Chinese academics advocating such a military posture, many feel that it would be very much in Beijing's interests to strike hard and decisively. In an interview I conducted with noted scholar Roger Cliff last year, he explained that many U.S. air bases that are close to China have few hardened facilities to protect themselves from a missile strike. This makes them sitting ducks in a conflict.
Al-Qa`ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is one of the few beneficiaries of Yemen’s collapse into civil war. It now governs one of the country’s three major ports and has expanded its operations in Yemen, benefiting from a larger recruiting pool. AQAP’s enlarged safe haven supports its efforts locally, but also serves as a sanctuary for the external operations cell that previously has threatened the United States several times. The affiliate remains al-Qa`ida’s greatest direct threat to the United States and it is growing stronger. Al-Qa`ida’s Yemen-based affiliate has been quietly expanding as the country descends further into civil war. It may be one of the few beneficiaries of Yemen’s collapse, other than the Islamic State, which is developing its own Yemeni franchise. Al-Qa`ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has taken advantage of the turmoil to try its hand at governance again and build support among Sunni tribes angered by the Huthi takeover of large swaths of the country. Yemen’s civil war has secured nearly all of AQAP’s immediate military objectives. The West retreated. The Yemeni military and security forces, what is left of them, are no longer fighting AQAP. Those elements that remain are divided and degraded, operating without a central command, and have no incentive to enter into another fight. The Yemeni state is broken, and local authorities have filled the void. Mediation efforts with Yemeni stakeholders have not yielded much progress on the political front, and even if a new central government emerges, it will have to work hard to rebuild relationships with provincial and local authorities. Finally, there is an active insurgency in Yemen rooted in Sunni communities that provides an opportunity for AQAP to further establish itself. The conditions are ripe for success, and AQAP is an adaptive organization. It appears to have learned from strategic errors in 2011 and 2012, which led to a popular uprising against it. The late AQAP emir, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, advised his Algerian counterpart in the summer of 2012 that, based on AQAP’s experiences in Abyan, meeting the people’s basic needs was the first step in governance.1 The group also appears to have copied tactics from al-Qa`ida’s Syrian affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra, and has better integrated itself into the population, by using local governance structures for example.2 Additionally, the broad mobilization of Sunnis against Huthis is giving AQAP momentum on which to draw. This condition was not present during the Arab Spring and will only further serve AQAP’s interests. AQAP’s gains in Yemen could have disastrous consequences. AQAP was behind at least four major attempted attacks on U.S. interests outside of Yemen, and all of those occurred when the group was weaker than it is today. AQAP is also still a key asset for the global al-Qa`ida network, providing overall leadership guidance, sharing expertise, and coordinating transnational attacks. AQAP’s growing strength in Yemen could reverberate throughout the al-Qa`ida network, raising the stakes in the competition between al-Qa`ida and the Islamic State to lead the global jihadist movement.3 Tapping into Yemen’s Insurgency The Yemeni insurgency began in earnest after the Huthi takeover of the central Yemeni government in January 2015, though many local militias had mobilized months earlier. Yemen’s complex political dynamics influenced the process. Many of those opposed to the Huthis also opposed the central government, but saw the Huthis as an invading force. These “popular resistance forces” draw from the local population and fight to protect their territory. They are not mobilizing along sectarian lines, but view the conflict in terms of the distribution of power. Despite the absence of religion as a primary factor, the frontline of the conflict ran through Sunni populations, creating a prime opportunity for AQAP in such places as al-Bayda, Shabwah, and Abyan, especially as AQAP tapped into the insurgency’s momentum. AQAP had already declared the Huthis as an enemy, describing them as heretics taking orders from Iran, who must be stopped.a By fall 2014, AQAP had expanded its campaign against them. Militants began conducting smaller-scale, disruptive attacks against Huthi positions and began assassinating Huthi officials. The campaign focused initially on the capital, Sana’a, and also al-Bayda governorate, where AQAP already had some limited support. AQAP conducted mass-casualty attacks against the Huthis, such as a December 18 twin suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (SVBIED) strike in the Red Sea port city of al-Hudaydah.4 The dedication of resources to the fight against the Huthis had little tangible effect on AQAP’s continued campaign against the Yemeni military. AQAP was able to sustain the same level of activity against the Yemeni military even as it increasingly targeted Huthis. This shows that AQAP had maintained some sort of reserve capability, and also that it was probably able to add strength over time. AQAP took advantage of the breakdown of Yemeni security forces in January 2015 and attacked now-isolated Yemeni military bases. Between February and April 2015, AQAP attacked the bases of the 19th Infantry Brigade in Shabwah, the 39th Armored Brigade in Abyan, and the 23rd Mechanized Brigade in Hadramawt.5 AQAP seized weaponry in each attack. These weapons were probably distributed to AQAP forces in Abyan and Shabwah; there is little evidence of them appearing in al-Bayda. Complex AQAP attacks against the Yemeni military ended in April, when it was evident the Yemeni military had effectively disbanded. AQAP’s primary effort on the ground is against the Huthis, and it is using this fight to make inroads among other Sunni populations that have mobilized in resistance. It claims to be active on all fronts against the Huthis and to be running training camps for new fighters. Jalal al-Marqishi, an AQAP military commander who led the fight in 2011 and 2012, characterized AQAP’s presence as both direct and indirect, including training and providing supplies and military advice.6 The group’s recent media releases include training videos on how to build improvised explosive devices (IEDs), for example.b AQAP appears to be attempting to replicate Jabhat al-Nusra’s success in gaining acceptance by using its military capabilities in service of goals important to local interests. The alignment of AQAP’s objectives with those of the popular resistance militias created an alliance where it might not otherwise have existed, especially since AQAP’s ideology is foreign to most Yemenis. It is within this space that AQAP seems to have been able to expand its base within the insurgency. AQAP is now a dominant force in such places as al-Bayda, where its ability to organize military offensives against the Huthis seems to have led local tribal militias to accept the presence of AQAP forces.c AQAP’s presence in al-Bayda is strategically important because a vital road from Yemen’s capital to the southeast runs through the governorate, providing direct access to central Yemen. AQAP had previously made inroads there, particularly in northwestern al-Bayda, where some of the local tribes openly supported it in 2012.7 The group has expanded since, building on anti-Huthi sentiments among local tribes. Though some clans were initially neutral to the Huthis’s arrival in al-Bayda, the deaths of fellow tribesmen began to drive popular resistance against the Huthis, and so AQAP stepped in to take advantage.8 For example, AQAP reportedly formed an alliance with the al-Hamiqan tribe in southeastern al-Bayda in February 2015 to fight the Huthis.9 AQAP has been careful to limit collateral damage and that has prevented a backlash against the group and allowed it to exploit local anger at the Huthis.d While the tribes may still turn on AQAP once the common enemy is defeated, opportunities to integrate AQAP’s forces into local militias and personnel into local governance structures may mitigate this risk. The Saudi-led military intervention is also creating opportunities for AQAP. In mid-July, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates deployed troops alongside newly trained Yemeni forces in Aden after a nearly four-month-long air campaign against the Huthis.10 The coalition rolled back Huthi gains in Aden before focusing on Lahij and Abyan. AQAP is among the groups filling the power vacuum behind the coalition’s advances. AQAP militants briefly seized buildings in Aden on August 22, and residents report AQAP forces are still in the city.e AQAP has also seized buildings in Zinjibar, the capital of Abyan, which AQAP held in 2011 and 2012.11 The coalition forces, including the Saudis, Emiratis, and Yemeni militias, are not focused on AQAP’s growing presence behind their frontline. AQAP’s Experiment with Governance in Hadramawt The deterioration of the Yemeni military has allowed AQAP to develop a safe haven in the country. It has been able to gather resources in areas removed from the frontlines, such as in Yemen’s eastern Hadramawt governorate. AQAP seized control of al-Mukalla, one of Yemen’s three major port cities, on April 2, 2015.12 But AQAP did not raise the tell-tale black flag immediately.13 Instead, the group took a softer approach. Its forces in al-Mukalla adopted the name, Sons of Hadramawt, and called for a local council to govern the city. Al-Mukalla-based leaders established the Hadhrami Domestic Council (HDC), a local council of Salafist-leaning individuals responsive to AQAP demands, which took over governance from the Sons of Hadramawt on April 13.[f] The failure of a powerful anti-government tribal alliance, the Hadramawt Tribal Confederacy (HTC), to re-secure al-Mukalla, first by force and then by negotiation, suggests that AQAP’s influence is durable.g The HDC runs the local government and administers the city. The Sons of Hadramawt maintain a security presence in the city, but reports from al-Mukalla described AQAP as operating in the shadows rather than openly, as it did in Abyan governorate during 2011. The Sons of Hadramawt turned over control of al-Mukalla’s infrastructure in the months following the initial seizure, including returning control of the airport.14 It is very likely that the Sons of Hadramawt is still able to move resources in and out of al-Mukalla’s air and sea ports, which will help AQAP support its efforts in southern and central Yemen. The Sons of Hadramawt police the city, and it operates a group called the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice that is essentially a religious police force.15 The group enforced a ban on the mild narcotic qat starting in early May, burning what it had seized in the street, and issued another warning against the drug in early July.16 Violence is used sparingly, but as an example. AQAP publicly executed two men accused of providing the information that led to the death of the group’s former emir, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, on June 1717 and hung their bodies from a bridge as a warning.18 At the end of July, the Sons of Hadramawt also publicly flogged individuals it claimed had used hashish.19 The group seems to have cemented its presence in the city. Residents protested against AQAP in late April and early June, but these demonstrations died out.20 Protesters in July cited the uptick in U.S. airstrikes in the area as a grievance and there were reports of the HDC negotiating AQAP’s withdrawal from the city, yet it remains in control through the Sons of Hadramawt and the HDC.h AQAP may be seeking to expand its control over Hadramawt. There are reports that Sons of Hadramawt convened a meeting in Shihr city in the district next to al-Mukalla in early August.21 AQAP seized the major infrastructure in the city, including the oil terminal and the seaport, in April, but there had been no attempt to govern.22At the end of July, however, there were indications that AQAP may have been seeking to re-open the front in Wadi Hadramawt, the HTC’s stronghold, which may be an attempt to secure the oil infrastructure there. On July 31, AQAP conducted a SVBIED attack targeting the 135th Brigade in al-Qatan, after more than four months of near inactivity[.2]3 A second roadside bomb attack on August 4 injured two soldiers in Sayun, Hadramawt.24 The resumption of a front in Wadi Hadramawt would probably mobilize the HTC to prevent further gains by AQAP, though the HTC leadership may acquiesce to AQAP in order to avoid further conflict. An Enduring Threat AQAP’s threat is heightened by its position within al-Qa`ida’s global network.25 There have been a series of reports over the past two years that AQAP is working with al-Qa`ida individuals in Syria to target the United States or the West and that individuals trained by AQAP’s imaginative bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, have moved into Syria.26 Al-Asiri is the mastermind behind AQAP’s most innovative and difficult-to-detect bombs, and he continues to improve his designs.27 AQAP probably maintains a connection to Syria—and therefore the foreign fighters in Syria—through the al-Qa`ida cell operating alongside Jabhat al-Nusra, dubbed the Khorasan Group.28 Significant attrition within AQAP’s leadership in 2015 has not reduced the threat.i AQAP, like other al-Qa`ida groups, is resilient to attrition. Al-Asiri remains at large and he has replicated his capabilities among apprentices.29 The death of Nasir al-Wuhayshi, who had been emir since 2007 and had become al-Qa`ida’s global general manager in 2013, did not cause notable shifts in AQAP’s Yemeni operations.30 Qasim al-Raymi, AQAP’s military commander, who had been at al-Wuhayshi’s side since 2006 and had overseen AQAP’s major transnational attacks, now commands the entire organization and has pledged bay`a (allegiance) to al-Qa`ida emir Ayman al-Zawahiri.31 A potential challenge for the group, however, will be replacing several leading religious leaders killed in recent drone strikes.j It is not readily apparent who will become that voice for AQAP, which will become a more important issue as the Islamic State expands in Yemen.32 The emergence of the Islamic State in Yemen increases the pressure on AQAP to sustain its success. The Islamic State’s leadership has openly described their al-Qa`ida counterparts as having abandoned true jihad and pursuing a failed strategy.k The Islamic State’s continued victories in Iraq and Syria, and its newfound strength in Sirte, Libya may encourage some Yemenis to support the Islamic State over AQAP, as will some Yemeni Salafist sheikhs declaring support for the Islamic State, such as Sheikh Abdul Majid al-Raymi.[l] An AQAP judge from Ibb, Ma’moun Abdulhamid Hatem, may have facilitated the initial growth of the Islamic State in Yemen. He publicly supported the group initially and the first major Islamic State suicide attack drew on recruits from Ibb.33 Recruitment by the Islamic State still appears limited though, and the group is restricted to operating as small cells.34 However, the Islamic State has signaled it may challenge AQAP in al-Bayda, expanding from its current focus on Sana’a.m For the time being, it is unlikely that the Islamic State will overtake AQAP as the predominant jihadist group in Yemen. AQAP is deepening its own relations with Sunni tribes and remains sensitive to Yemeni tribal `urf (customs), but AQAP must maintain its momentum with an ongoing narrative of victory if it is to prevent the Islamic State from making further gains. As has been noted, the Islamic State’s rise in the global jihadist movement challenges al-Qa`ida. Al-Qa`ida’s response will probably be to attempt to prove that its strategy—one that uses attacks against the West to undermine support for governments in Muslim-majority lands—remains successful. As a result, al-Qa`ida is likely under pressure to conduct a spectacular attack against the West in order to demonstrate its continued relevance. That would almost certainly involve AQAP’s well-developed capabilities, which have been enhanced by its expanded safe haven in Yemen. The persistence of AQAP’s bomb-making capabilities and its expertise in transnational attacks underpins the enduring threat from that group. A July 30 statement attributed to al-Asiri noted that AQAP has “chosen war against America” and that “America is first.”35 The leaders of both al-Qa`ida and AQAP have again begun pushing for smaller-scale lone-wolf attacks in the West.n AQAP first began calling for such attacks, which it calls lone jihad, in July 2010, with the release of its English-language magazine Inspire and regular statements from the late radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.36 Khaled Batarfi, a senior AQAP commander who was freed from al-Mukalla’s prison when AQAP took control of the city, appeared in an August 4 video that praised the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris and the Chattanooga shooter in the United States.37 Batarfi called for Muslims to expand the “jihad uprising,” and cited lone jihad as helping to achieve global goals.
The Trump administration is preparing executive orders that would clear the way to drastically reduce the United States’ role in the United Nations and other international organizations, as well as begin a process to review and potentially abrogate certain forms of multilateral treaties. The first of the two draft orders, titled “Auditing and Reducing U.S. Funding of International Organizations” and obtained by The New York Times, calls for terminating funding for any United Nations agency or other international body that meets any one of several criteria. Those criteria include organizations that give full membership to the Palestinian Authority or Palestine Liberation Organization, or support programs that fund abortion or any activity that circumvents sanctions against Iran or North Korea. The draft order also calls for terminating funding for any organization that “is controlled or substantially influenced by any state that sponsors terrorism” or is blamed for the persecution of marginalized groups or any other systematic violation of human rights. The order calls for then enacting “at least a 40 percent overall decrease” in remaining United States funding toward international organizations. The order establishes a committee to recommend where those funding cuts should be made. It asks the committee to look specifically at United States funding for peacekeeping operations; the International Criminal Court; development aid to countries that “oppose important United States policies”; and the United Nations Population Fund, which oversees maternal and reproductive health programs. If President Trump signs the order and its provisions are carried out, the cuts could severely curtail the work of United Nations agencies, which rely on billions of dollars in annual United States contributions for missions that include caring for refugees. The second executive order, “Moratorium on New Multilateral Treaties,” calls for a review of all current and pending treaties with more than one other nation. It asks for recommendations on which negotiations or treaties the United States should leave. The order says this review applies only to multilateral treaties that are not “directly related to national security, extradition or international trade,” but it is unclear what falls outside these restrictions. For example, the Paris climate agreement or other environmental treaties deal with trade issues but could potentially fall under this order. An explanatory statement that accompanies the draft order mentions two United Nations treaties for review: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Taken together, the orders suggest that Mr. Trump intends to pursue his campaign promises of withdrawing the United States from international organizations. He has expressed heavy skepticism of multilateral agreements such as the Paris climate agreement and of the United Nations.
In Brown v. Board of Education, Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, waxed rhapsodic about the role of public education in American life. After noting that it was “perhaps the most important function of state and local governments,” he went on to observe that “it is the very foundation of good citizenship…[and] a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment.”1 It is with the first part of Warren’s declaration that this chapter is concerned. I investigate how education came to be the “most important function” of state and local governments. How did legislators who remained generally distrustful of government intervention—state, federal, or otherwise—accede to the creation of an extensive network of publicly-funded schools? And in what ways and to what extent did the framing and reframing of these subnational constitutions affirm, embody, and actualize this function? To answer these questions, I have organized this chapter into three sections. The first section examines the earliest attempts at including provisions related to education in state constitutions. The aim here is twofold: first, to illustrate how these earliest provisions, regardless of wording (or re-wording, as the case may be), created no enforceable legal rights and duties; and second, to show how one notable court of the era, the Massachusetts Supreme Court, twice interpreted its constitutional provision in exactly that manner.
Society and its institutions are analogical to Derrida’s notion of community. Derrida, however, asserts an aversion to the word community as well as to the thing itself. His primary concern for the word relates to its connotations of fusion and identification (Weber, 1995). Caputo (1997) elucidates these meanings with reference to Derrida’s etymological examination of community. Communio is a word for military formation and a kissing cousin of the word “munitions”: to have a communio is to be fortified on all sides, to build a “common” (com) “defense” (munis), as when a wall is put up around the city to keep the stranger or the foreigner out. The self-protective closure of “community,” then, would be just about the opposite of . . . preparation for the incoming of the other, “open” and “porous” to the other. . . . A “universal community” excluding no one is a contradiction in terms; communities always have an inside and an outside. (p. 108) Thus, the word community has negative connotations suggesting injustice, inequality, and an “us” versus “them” orientation. Community, as a thing, would constitute a binary opposition with the aforementioned concept of democratic society. The latter evolves with, not against, the other. Although the connotations may be latent and unconscious, any reference to a community or a derivative there of connotes the exclusion of some other. A demo- cratic society, then, must reject the analogical conceptions of community and present itself as a receptacle for receiving difference, that is, the demos (the people) representing a democratic society.
Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as prosperity) of a nonviolent nature, which, though far in the future, demands urgent action. It is the threat of global warming to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. Scientists worldwide have been observing the gathering of this threat for three decades now, and what was once a mere possibility has passed through probability to near certainty. Indeed not one of more than 900 articles on climate change published in refereed scientific journals from 1993 to 2003 doubted that anthropogenic warming is occurring. “In legitimate scientific circles,” writes Elizabeth Kolbert, “it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fundamentals of global warming.” Evidence from a vast international scientific monitoring effort accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: an international panel predicts “brutal droughts, floods and violent storms across the planet over the next century”; climate change could “literally alter ocean currents, wipe away huge portions of Alpine Snowcaps and aid the spread of cholera and malaria”; “glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and…worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than a decade ago”; “rising sea temperatures have been accompanied by a significant global increase in the most destructive hurricanes”; “NASA scientists have concluded from direct temperature measurements that 2005 was the hottest year on record, with 1998 a close second”; “Earth’s warming climate is estimated to contribute to more than 150,000 deaths and 5 million illnesses each year” as disease spreads; “widespread bleaching from Texas to Trinidad…killed broad swaths of corals” due to a 2-degree rise in sea temperatures. “The world is slowly disintegrating,” concluded Inuit hunter Noah Metuq, who lives 30 miles from the Arctic Circle. “They call it climate change…but we just call it breaking up.” From the founding of the first cities some 6,000 years ago until the beginning of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere remained relatively constant at about 280 parts per million (ppm). At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how serous the effects will be. As the newspaper stories quoted above show, we are already experiencing the effects of 1-2 degree warming in more violent storms, spread of disease, mass die offs of plants  and animals, species extinction, and threatened inundation of low-lying countries like the Pacific nation of Kiribati and the Netherlands at a warming of 5 degrees or less the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida, and inundate Manhattan up to the middle of Greenwich Village. Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation that keeps the winter weather in Europe far warmer than its latitude would otherwise allow. Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system. At worst, says physics professor Marty Hoffert of New York University, “we’re just going to burn everything up;   we’re going to het the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, and then everything will collapse.” During the Cold War, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the Untied States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possible end life on this planet. Global warming is the post-Cold War era’s equivalent of nuclear winter at least as serious and considerably better supported scientifically. Over the long run it puts dangers form terrorism and traditional military challenges to shame. It is a threat not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet.
Feminist analyses of human trafficking have eschewed a traditional security framework, considering instead the security of trafficked persons, recognizing the manner in which both traffickers and the state itself pose security threats. Table 1 summarizes the traditional security and feminist approaches to human trafficking and demonstrates how changing the referent object of security leads to a change in policy focus as well.5 Feminists challenge the traditional security approach to international human trafficking on two levels: the ethical and the pragmatic. Feminists argue that as an issue of ethics, human trafficking is first and foremost a violation of human rights.6 Focusing on trafficking as a security threat to the state neglects the voices of trafficked persons, whose human rights the state is legally obligated to protect. Founded on the premise that scholars of trafficking need to shift their focus from state security to the security of people, feminist research on trafficking began with analyses of the experiences of trafficked persons, emphasizing in particular the plight of women trafficked for sexual exploitation. From a standpoint of efficacy, feminists hold that traditional security approaches compound rather than solve the problem of trafficking. First, repressive border control policies make migration more difficult and dangerous and increase migrants’ vulnerability to traffickers. Second, trafficked persons who are deported are themselves prone to re-trafficking. In short, feminists maintain that traditional security approaches to human trafficking are both morally and practically deficient. Feminist analyses of human trafficking do more than expand the referent of security from states to people. While many feminists highlight the plight of trafficked persons—and this remains an important and worthy endeavor— it is important to note that to simply expand the referent of security is insufficient: care must be taken in regard to how actors are constructed as threatened. This is because prevalent constructions of human trafficking rely upon and reproduce gender and racial stereotypes that (1) discount women’s agency, (2) establish a standard for victimization that most trafficked persons cannot meet, and (3) unjustly prioritize the sexual traffic of white women over the traffic of women and men of all races who are trafficked for purposes including, but not exclusive to, the sex trade. Feminist approaches to human trafficking clearly share a good deal with the alternative security frameworks that have arisen in the past two decades. In J. Ann Tickner’s words, “Feminists’ commitment to the emancipatory goal of ending women’s subordination is consistent with a broad definition of security that takes the individual, situated in broader social structures, as its starting point.”7 In particular, feminist approaches are largely congruent with the concept of “human security” proposed in the UN Development Program’s (UNDP) 1994 Human Development Report.8 Though the concept itself has been subject to debate and criticism, human security, in general, is characterized by a shift in focus from security of the state to the security of people, changing the referent of security in much the same way that feminists have done with trafficking.9 This is not to say, however, that a human security approach to trafficking would subsume a feminist approach; feminist analyses of trafficking establish the necessity of gender as a category of analysis in a way that traditional and human security theories do not. As noted, feminists not only establish women as a referent of security and focus on gender-related human rights abuses but also, and perhaps more significantly, study the manner in which gender stereotypes are used to establish and reproduce categories of practices, perpetrators, and victims.
No one knows what they've got until they lose it," said Belkis Brito, the managing director of socialist televiseion channel Guatopo TV, which she and her team run from the chavista stronghold of Santa Teresa del Tuy, an industrial conurbation on the outskirts of Caracas. A member of one of the more radical factions of chavismo, Belkis works hard to propagate the ideologies of her comandante. From her radical perspective, she has little faith in President Maduro's commitment to the Bolivarian Revolution. "We voted for him because he spoke passionately about the revolution," she said in an interview in the television studio, overlooking the asbestos roofs of the surrounding slum. "But Maduro is not continuing the fight with the speed that we need. We want to see concrete action." President Maduro is not only feeling pressure from the chavistas who mourn his predecessor, he is also facing an opposition party that refuses to accept his victory in last month's elections. Citing over 3,000 counts of electoral fraud, the party's allegations range from multiple-voting in chavista-strong areas to polling booth intimidation. Such claims have been lent momentum by the U.S. government's refusal to legitimize Maduro's leadership on similar grounds. "He's fighting a battle on two fronts," said Mark Jones, professor of political science at Rice University in Texas, "with an opposition that denies his legitimacy as president and with the chavistas who supported him only because Chavez told them to." The crisis created by the opposition's refusal to legitimize the newly elected president has been magnified by a schism within the government itself. With the opposition barred from participating in congress until Maduro is recognized, decisions are being made by the shadowy "political-military command" fronted by Diosdado Cabello, the congress president and military-backed political powerhouse currently embroiled in a corruption scandal. Ultimately, the power wielded by Cabello within the government could turn into the most serious threat to Maduro. Polarizing the country further than ever, the opposition's position manifested a brawl in the National Congress and Capriles himself has been threatened with jail for his submission to the supreme court that Maduro's victory be annulled. Yet while the politicians bicker, Venezuela is suffering. The annual inflation rate is nearing 30 percent, the country's annual homicides exceed those of the United States and Europe's combined, and the chronic shortages of basic goods are causing supermarket waiting times of up to three hours. "There's no sugar, flour, oil, or toilet paper," said Ricardo Mota, a 34-year-old publicist waiting in a Caracas store to buy four bags of rice, the maximum permitted due to short supply. "We're forced to stock up on these things because we don't know when there will be more." "It's the government's fault," he added. "The socialists have been fighting so hard to stay in power that they've ignored the needs of the people." Many observers doubt Maduro's ability to handle these problems. The new president's public confidence and political influence have suffered following a difficult post-election period for the socialists. "Maduro looks like someone who just barely scraped a win after Chavez left him a 15 percentage point lead," says David Smilde, professor of sociology at the University of Georgia. "His lack of popularity gives him less power within the government, and therefore less mandate to be an effective president." Maduro has been left with no one but himself to blame for the country's worsening situation. The political strategy of passing the buck to the preceding government is unavailable to a politician who campaigned primarily on extolling the virtues of his predecessor. "Right from the beginning there was the danger that whoever had to follow Chavez would become the scapegoat for the problems he left behind", says Professor Smilde, "and it's going to make Maduro go down in history as the man who couldn't keep up Chavez's legacy". "Chavez's charisma and popularity allowed him to get away with far more in terms of policy shortcomings," says Professor Jones. "Maduro gets none of that benefit because he lacks the built-up goodwill that Chavez enjoyed." "Maduro isn't being cut any slack", he says, "he's being forced to be one hundred percent accountable for the failings under Chavez. This would be difficult for anyone, but it's especially tough for a president who is seen as illegitimate." Others see little reason to lose faith in Venezuelan socialism simply due to the loss of its posterboy. "Everyone says Chavez was popular because of his charisma," says Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C., "but he won 15 elections because he delivered on his promises." "The government needs to stabilize the exchange rate, bring down inflation and handle the shortages," the co-director of the independent think tank continued, "the situation is very fixable. The economy isn't a question of charisma, it's a question of policy." As Venezuela takes stock following the loss of Hugo Chavez, the country is looking to the man charged with carrying the torch of the firebrand leader's legacy. But lacking the show-stealing, crowd-pulling, blame-dodging charisma that Hugo Chavez exuded, the irony is that having won the election, Maduro must now win the country's confidence if he is to lead his nation forward. "We don't need jokes, or songs, or dancing politicians," said Enzo Bogatí, a 40-year-old communications technician speaking from an opposition heartland in the district of Altamira in Caracas, "we've had fourteen years of that and look where it got us". "What Venezuela needs is sound policy and responsible government," he added, "that's something we haven't seen in a long time."
President Mike Pence? The question is way ahead of where we are. There’s no solid reason to expect that President Trump will leave office before his term is done, whether by resignation, impeachment or the untried mechanism of the 25th amendment.   But that hasn’t stopped anyone from talking about it — from Republicans wistful for the days of a functional White House to Democrats trying to guess which unpalatable future would be worse for their battered party. And the answer should be straightforward. Pence would be an improvement on grounds of simple competence. He would make the country safer. Under a President Pence, Americans would have less cause to fear that a blundering president might lead us into war with North Korea or Iran. Progressives would find almost nothing to like in Pence’s domestic policies. There’s no sugarcoating that. He would be the most conservative president of modern times — easily more conservative than Trump, more even than Ronald Reagan, the right’s patron saint. He would be the most conservative president of modern times — easily more conservative than Trump, more even than Ronald Reagan. His economic views are in line with orthodox Republicanism: lower taxes, smaller government, fewer regulations. Pence’s positions on social issues spring from Christian conservatism: He’s fiercely opposed to abortion, gay marriage and almost any expansion of rights for gays, lesbians and transgender people. Despite all that, unlike the president, he has read the Constitution and understands its meaning. He would be less likely than Trump to try to pressure the FBI to drop an investigation, to take one example. He has even defended freedom of the press. He was coauthor of a bill to protect journalists from being compelled to identify their sources, and he founded a bipartisan press freedom caucus — along with, of all people, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Glendale), now one of the top congressional investigators pursuing Trump. “He’s a person of real integrity,” said Rick Boucher, a former House member from Virginia who was the Democratic coauthor of the bill to shield journalists. “He’s very conservative, especially on social issues. But he does have respect on the other side of the aisle. He’s very serious about public policy, and willing to work with Democrats where there’s common purpose.” (That doesn’t mean Boucher is ready to endorse his old colleague for president. “I was a strong Obama supporter,” he said. “I won’t sleep easy until there’s a Democrat in the White House.”) To be sure, Pence already has questions to answer about his short tenure as vice president. After Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey, Pence vigorously parroted the White House’s initial explanation that Comey was cashiered based on a recommendation from the Justice Department. That wasn’t true — and Pence may have known it wasn’t true at the time. Pence has also maintained that he didn’t know Trump’s first national security advisor, Michael T. Flynn, was under investigation by the FBI when he was appointed. That denial may turn out to be true. Even though Pence was formally the chairman of Trump’s transition, he wasn’t in the president-elect’s inner circle when the initial staffing decisions were made. There’s plenty of evidence that even now, Trump aides spend much of their time hiding important facts from each other. In any case, the FBI’s investigation of Flynn is likely to bring any discrepancies to light. (In which case: President Paul Ryan? That’s a matter for another column.) As a matter of pure politics, it’s impossible to predict whether a President Pence could improve GOP prospects in the 2018 congressional election or win reelection himself in 2020. But Pence represents a slice of his own party, the social conservative right, which has never won a presidential nomination, let alone a general election. (George W. Bush ran with their support, as did Mitt Romney, but neither was as rooted among social conservatives as Pence.) He’d have a lot of work to expand his appeal beyond the GOP base, to attract independent Trump loyalists who might blame him for their man’s downfall, or spurn him as the kind of establishment politician they abhor. And, if he were to become president, he’d come under immediate pressure from those Trump loyalists to pardon his predecessor for any crimes committed in office or during the campaign. The last time that happened, when Gerald Ford pardoned Richard M. Nixon in 1974, it left the new president vulnerable to a Democratic challenger. It’s tempting, of course, for partisan Democrats to say: Let Republicans continue to struggle in the mess Trump makes. Why give them a chance to right their ship? The worse the better. But that ignores the risks that would come from allowing Trump to continue exercising the powers of the presidency in both law enforcement and foreign policy. For the next three years, given the limited alternatives, I’d opt for President Pence — the sooner the better.
A Formal and Legally Binding Agreement International agreements to promote cooperation in scientific research and development can be bilateral or multilateral, government-wide or at the level of individual technical agencies (e.g., the National Science Foundation or the National Institutes of Health). The focus of this paper is on bilateral, government-wide agreements, also referred to as umbrella agreements, framework agreements, or simply S&T agreements. Scientific cooperation between the United States and other countries is undertaken using a variety of arrangements, from informal scientist-to-scientist collaborations to cooperation between research institutions to formal agreements between technical agencies. While S&T agreements are not necessary for these types of interactions, other nations often seek S&T agreements with the United States because they carry the weight of being legally binding and having been negotiated on behalf of the U.S. government. These agreements endeavor to establish a framework to foster international science collaboration while protecting intellectual property, establishing benefit sharing, and preventing taxation of research equipment. The contents of an S&T agreement usually include common features such as types of cooperative activities and ways to encourage access to facilities and personnel, as well as clarification that some information or equipment—such as those requiring protection for national security reasons—are not covered under the agreement. There are three areas where the agreement text often varies: (1) the preamble, which is not legally binding and is often used to highlight the public motivations behind the agreement; (2) the intellectual property rights annex, which delineates how the parties share and exploit intellectual property generated; and (3) the implementation plan, including whether to establish a joint committee that would meet regularly to review execution of the agreement.
Emergency preparedness requires substantive and procedural coordination to harmonize initiatives at various levels of governance. Dynamic federalism can occur in a manner that allows federalist systems to address climate change.15 Nascent disaster planning has begun to harmonize the roles of the public sector’s various layers, fleshing out the means by which communities will address human security as climate risks become better understood.16 An adaptive process informed by new scientific understanding of where and in what manner climate disruptions are likely to occur provides for better planning for potential extreme flooding and heat waves. For instance, local jurisdictions can work with their national partners to update maps in order to reflect the climate impacts for given areas. Current maps are not likely to adequately guide flood insurance decisions or requisite emergency response resources. Overall, adaptation measures need to integrate policies to protect food security and such infrastructure as transportation systems and power stations in the face of fires, floods, and other potential disasters. 17
Onshore state and local economies benefit from the development of OCS resources by providing goods and services to offshore oil and gas extraction sites. Onshore communities provide all manner of goods and services required by offshore oil and gas extraction. A variety of industries are involved in this effort: shipbuilders provide exploration vessels, permanent and movable platforms, and resupply vessels; steelworkers fashion the drilling machinery and specialized pipes required for offshore resource extraction; accountants and bankers provide financial services; and other onshore employees provide groceries, transportation, refining, and other duties. These onshore jobs, in turn, support other jobs and other industries (such as retail and hospitality establishments).
The profound injustices that inhere in climate change’s disproportionate effects are obvious, yet two bear explication. One is that the unequal burden that is occurring, and is predicted, falls on those who have not been primarily responsible for climate change, domestically as well as internationally.75 African Americans, for example, are “less responsible for climate change than other Americans; . . . at present, African Americans emit 20 percent less greenhouse gases per household,”76 and on a per capita basis.77 It is also true that the less wealthy half of America, regardless of race, is far less responsible for carbon dioxide emissions as well.78 Further, historically these percentage disparities were even higher.79 The second, and perhaps most compelling, injustice is the compounding effect of the environmental risk on the underlying societal inequities— inequality that resulted in the uneven patterns of development and access to resources and opportunity in America.80 In other words, the legacy of slavery, segregation, the placement of reservations for indigenous populations, and the more elusive systemic discrimination that has followed, for example, is now locking in differentiated experiences of a warming planet. The reach of that racial discrimination has deep implications for the structuring of sound and just climate policy. The distribution of climate change impacts is likely to be increasingly unjust; for that reason, it is imperative that the solutions proffered neither entrench existing vulnerabilities nor introduce new ones.81 Without early and meaningful participation from EJ communities, the interests and needs of those communities will insufficiently inform strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change.82 In short, climate policy for both mitigation and adaptation can create its own “winners and losers,”83 and without fair decision-making in the process of crafting solutions, “fair outcomes will only ever be coincidental.”84
Seizing the opportunity to change the logic of international cooperation in China’s wind energy sector does not come without risk. Business actors on both sides will be reluctant to enter into comprehensive partnerships fearing that their engagement will follow the familiar unsustainable pattern of cooperation. Foreign companies will be concerned about sharing technological expertise without getting significant market entry in return. At the same time, skepticism about foreign companies’ willingness to share the latest technology and cooperate on an equal footing will result in Chinese companies being reluctant to provide entry points into the domestic market. Newly emerging incentive structures are currently opening a window of opportunity for breaking this vicious cycle, but change will not occur without decisive action. Both sides will have to credibly signal a fundamental change in approach in order to prepare the ground for new models of cooperation. In addition, governmental actors on both sides will have to play an active role in facilitating this development by providing additional incentives and minimizing possible risks for those companies willing to take the cooperative logic to the next level. Based on the analysis of past mistakes as well as present opportunities, this paper outlines ways in which the emergence of a new model of international cooperation in China’s wind power sector can be facilitated by all parties involved. The recommendations specifically address four groups of actors: China’s political leadership, Chinese companies active in the wind sector, the European Union (EU) as a political actor1 and European companies involved in the development, manufacturing and trade of wind energy equipment. The required change in the logic of international technology cooperation can only be achieved if all of these groups alter their current behavior with regards to three interlinked dimensions: (1) Shift in paradigm to reflect the changing realities of China’s wind energy market (2) Targeted public and private investment in strategically chosen technology areas (3) Improved management of intellectual property rights (IPR) and profits from innovation
A maritime stand-off between China and the Philippines developed in a reef area known as the Scaborough Shoal in April, with China denying reports it was preparing for war at the height of the tension in May.∂ Both sides accused the other of intruding into territorial waters.∂ Vietnam was also angered by a recent call from China for oil exploration in disputed territory.∂ China has overlapping territorial claims with several Asean members - the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei - in the resource rich area.∂ But Asean members are divided over what to do. The four affected countries want action but others, like Cambodia, are recipients of Chinese aid and investment, and reluctant to rock the boat, says the BBC's Guy DeLauney.∂ Asean was set up in 1967 by Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore. Brunei joined in 1984, followed by Vietnam in 1995, Laos and Burma in 1997 and Cambodia in 1999.
This effect only holds, however, in areas that are rich in nutrients. In the experimental microcosms where the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus were kept low, those limits defined the relative abundance of plants and animals. And other factors—ocean acidity or salinity—could also play large roles. "The ultimate effect of temperature on zooplankton and consumers higher in the food chain will depend on other ocean conditions that affect resource availability," O'Connor says. That could mean that nutrient-rich waters in places like the Arctic Ocean will begin to see this food chain shift as the seas continue to warm—and a consequent rise in the number of fish. "Our experiments and current theory suggest that warming in nutrient-rich areas should increase [the number of] fish," O'Connor says. "I think we can figure out how and where climate change may lead to greater fish productivity and where it might reduce fish productivity." But even in the Arctic, there is typically a nutrient limit, says phytoplankton ecologist Michael Behrenfeld of Oregon State University. "It's a very interesting idea," he says. But an increase in fish harvests "might be a bridge too far with this. There are other factors that need to be considered." For example, his own satellite-imagery research on the phytoplankton in the North Atlantic reveals that bloom starts in wintertime as a result of deep, nutrient-rich water welling up to the surface. Warming is diminishing that upwelling and therefore the availability of nutrients. "We see a decrease in blooms," Behrenfeld says. "How much can we use [four-liter] microcosms to extrapolate to natural systems, especially natural systems at longer timescales?" Nevertheless, the experiment provides a glimpse of how the marine food chain might be transformed by climate change. "Worldwide, ocean waters are warming and will continue to warm by several degrees," O'Connor says. "By understanding the effects of temperature in these ideal conditions, we can begin to apply this model to natural systems."
Earlier this month representatives and senators were back in their home states celebrating Independence Day. Wouldn’t it be terrific if they had also been celebrating Oil Independence Day? Unfortunately, that was not the case. As temperatures rise across the country, so does our national anxiety over gas prices. Every summer brings the same dilemma: families agonizing over how much of their paychecks they are willing to fork over to errands and summer road trips, and politicians agonizing about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and engaging in “drill, baby, drill” politics. The fact is, we will never be energy independent as long as we remain joined at the hip with oil. Oil-based policies — even commonsense ones, such as “use it or lose it” leases to prevent big oil companies from sitting on prime reserves in the Gulf — would have a modest impact. They would raise American production over the short term, but they would have little impact on the world price of oil — which Americans pay even on domestic oil — and would leave America fully exposed to future oil price shocks. A recent trip back to my home state of Oregon shows a different path forward. We can chart a course toward lasting energy independence by making modest investments in electric vehicle infrastructure now. With this in mind during the Independence Day work period, I drove border to border in Oregon completely oil-free to showcase the new possibilities of electric vehicles — eight counties, more than 300 miles and not one drop of gasoline. Now that’s what I call declaring independence from overseas oil! Consider this added benefit: It cost only 3 cents per mile to fuel the Nissan Leaf. For the cost of one $50 tank of gasoline, the Leaf can carry you and your family halfway across America. My border-to-border trip was possible because our state recently completed the first “electric highway,” with charging stations available every 20 to 40 miles on Interstate 5 between the Washington state and California borders. Many of these stations are fast chargers where drivers can charge up in under half an hour. This infrastructure is a beginning, but much more needs to be done. With a sustained focus on vehicle incentives, charging infrastructure and a little bit of research and development, we could greatly accelerate the adoption of oil-free car travel. But we need a plan and the determination to get us there. To that end, I have introduced the Promoting Electric Vehicles Act along with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). This bill would create a half-dozen pilot electric vehicle deployment communities for infrastructure to be installed and tested. This deployment community approach would allow us to see what works best for drivers in different types of communities — big and small, urban and rural, North, South, East and West — and use those lessons to create deployment plans that will work all across America. Our bill also emphasizes investment in battery technologies, which is a key component in bringing down costs over time. Right now, the high cost of batteries makes the initial cost of an electric vehicle prohibitive for some families. Battery research and development can help make electric vehicles affordable for more families in the future, as well as pack more juice into batteries of lower weight and volume. More than 236 years after we first declared our independence as a nation, it’s time for us to finally declare our independence from overseas oil and rising gas prices. We have the technology and the know-how to make electric vehicles a true choice for millions of families over the next decade, providing freedom from oil and oil prices. Now we just need the political will to move forward.
Over the longer term, there are other threats. Because of its conventional military weakness compared to the US (and Israel), Iran has typically preferred to employ terrorism and cyber attacks – more often directed at American allies than at the US itself – to create problems for Washington without creating a pretext for a major US military response. We’ve already seen that begin with mysterious attacks on Saudi oil tankers off the coast of the UAE, and drone strikes by Iran’s Houthi allies on Saudi oil pipelines. These attacks have the twin benefits for Iran of hurting (and potentially humiliating) a key American ally while simultaneously jacking up the price of oil. In the past, the Iranians have also mounted cyber-attacks on the computer network of Saudi Aramco, the company that controls the Saudi oil network. If Iran continues this pattern of activity, the US and its allies will look for ways to deter and defeat the Iranian attacks. At some point, the US (or the Israelis, if they get dragged in, as they often are) might decide to respond with a military strike. And the Iranians might feel compelled to respond in kind, if only to demonstrate that they won’t take a punch without throwing one in return. Again, there’s good reason to believe that that would be the end of it, but it’s not impossible that it might be the start of something bigger. We should also remember that on occasion in the past, Iran has overstepped itself, mounting terror attacks that could have (and should have) crossed American red lines. In 1996, Iran blew up the Khobar Towers housing complex in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 and injuring almost 400 American military personnel. In 2011, Iran plotted to blow up a restaurant in Washington, D.C. while the Saudi Ambassador was dining there. The attack was foiled before it could be executed, but if brought to fruition, it could have killed scores of people in America’s capital. These were reckless Iranian moves at times of great tension that could easily have triggered a US military response.
Bioprospecting has the added potential to cause negative impacts on delicate ecosystems of the deep seabed and Antarctica. In situ experiments in and around the Deep Seabed can introduce light and noise or change water temperature, which, in-turn, can affect pro-creation and the survival of organisms in these areas. Bioprospecting activities can also produce pollution in the form of debris or discharge from vessels and equipment. Additionally, inadvertent movement of organisms through disrupting currents or discarding of scientific samples can lead to biological contamination. Finally, there is the usual possibility of over-exploitation in harvesting organisms in these regions and the flow on environmental impacts. Yet, this aspect is unclear due to the lack of information about ecosystems in these marine habitats. In this respect, the precautionary principle7 would seemingly apply to any future environmental regulations developed to govern bioprospecting activities in the High Seas and Antarctica. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (‘the Assessment’) est- mates that the current and projected future impact of bioprospecting on ecosystems is low, because the amount of material that needs to be harvested is normally small.8 The Assessment also states that there is a strong synergy between biodiversity preservation and bioprospecting, since the latter benefits from preserving the former. However, it warns that great uncertainty remains about the potential impact of bioprospecting activities. As the projected impact is minimal, although uncertain, bioprospecting does not presently implicate provisions of international agree¬ments which regulate actions likely to have serious adverse environmental impacts in the commons. The legal implications of any potential environmental impacts from bioprospecting are not explored in detail through this issue brief, but must be a consideration for decision-makers in drafting future laws and policies to regulate this activity. materials between States, particularly for developing nations. Additionally, there are no clear guidelines on the environmental standards bioprospecting expeditions must meet. The content and interplay between the existing laws governing bioprospecting in the High Seas and Antarctica are examined below, along with the legal gaps and uncertainties this exposes in the current framework.
There are millions of stowaways headed for the Arctic. Sea-dwelling organisms that could wreak havoc on Arctic ecosystems are hiding out in and on ships that, more and more, are using shipping routes in the North. A report published last week by Whitman Miller, an ecologist at the Marine Invasions Research Laboratory at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, stated that invasive species are destined for the Arctic with the influx of vessels. Melting sea ice has opened routes in the Arctic — the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route — making a quicker path from one side of the world to the other. "The economic draw of the Arctic is enormous," Miller wrote in the report. "Whether it's greater access to the region's rich natural resource reserves or cheaper and faster inter-ocean commercial trade, Arctic shipping will reshape world markets. If unchecked, these activities will vastly alter the exchange of invasive species, especially across the Arctic, north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans." Organisms from ports can cling to the undersides of a ship's hull or hunker down in the large tanks of seawater inside a ship. "Ships are moving over the Arctic and can carry a tremendous number of species in their ballast water ... connecting ports in a way that they have not been connected before," Miller said last week. The danger lies in the likelihood of these critters taking over their new environment and killing off native species. Miller said for the past century or so, ships traveling between oceans got from one to the other by way of the Panama or Suez Canals. "The potential biological cocktail that you can concoct is pretty staggering," Miller said. Ballast tanks on big ships can hold up to about 100,000 metric tons of water, Miller said. And once you start multiplying that by the number of shipping vessels in the water heading north, the amount of water and living organisms exchanged is enormous. When a species arrives in a new environment, they have no established predators, said Gary Freitag, a marine biologist with the Marine Advisory Program in Ketchikan. "They have a tendency to prey on the native species, eat the food of the native species, and take over habitat of the native species," he said. "And in most cases, they're a little more resilient because if they're able to establish in an unfamiliar habitat, they're pretty flexible critters." If left unchecked, invasive species spread rapidly with little course of action because they can be difficult to detect until the damage is done. "We don't quite know what will happen in the Arctic because we haven't experienced invasive species really in the Arctic yet." A few years ago, Freitag traveled to the North Slope to collect data from the waters off Point Barrow. Much of their efforts were stymied by a storm, he said, but he is planning more work in the North. A current threat in other parts of Alaska is the European green crab, a hardy crustacean that can thrive in a variety of climates.
But Xi’s innovation is not his charisma per se – refreshing though it is after years of Hu’s stoicism. Rather, Xi Jinping is distinctive in that he is the first Chinese Party head to truly understand that authoritarian politicians have something to learn from their democratic counterparts. Western politicians may get flak for perceptions of pandering or placing electoral viability ahead of common interest, but one thing at which democratic politicians unquestionably do better is connecting and empathizing with ordinary people.¶ Xi gets it. Whether it’s Corey Booker’s masterful use of Twitter or Bill Clinton’s moving performance during the ‘92 debates, it is clear that the best politicians are the ones who can speak at the level of their audience, and in doing so humanize themselves as individuals who understand the struggles of ordinary citizens. In one sense, Xi has already proven himself to be a better student of this than Mitt Romney, whose comment antagonizing 47% of the country would have gone down just as badly in China as it did in the United States.¶ This is all the more important because of the age Xi lives in. The country he inherits is a place where vigilant netizens can shelter criminal defendants, oust adulterous officials, and even help abolish unconstitutional regulations. This level of scrutiny is unprecedented, particularly for a new leader whose vision and humanity are still unknown quantities. In a country where the previous cohort of sovereigns have appeared ever more distant while public outrage towards graft and inequality have only grown fiercer, Xi’s projection of himself as an   authentic and upright  leader could set him apart as an entirely new breed of politician.¶ Crafting an empathetic public image can enhance sound leadership. This is true for any polity, but  particularly for non-democratic societies where leaders lack the legitimacy-conferring authority of popular election. President Obama had more than a year to sell himself on the campaign trail before setting foot into an office he had won. Xi, in comparison, had his stilted official biography rolled out via state news organs, but lacked the autonomy to personally introduce himself to the Chinese people until he actually assumed the reins of power. His 'presidential campaign' is only just beginning.¶ If he succeeds, it will be a boon to him in two ways. First, China’s challenges are severe, and as they worsen, frustrated citizens will need to know they have an empathetic leader on high. In China, there remains a longstanding belief that the emperor, under the mandate of heaven, is fundamentally just. As long as instances of local abuse are brought to his attention, all will be remedied. This is what still brings countless aggrieved petitioners into Beijing every year with letters addressed to China’s highest authorities. But if trust in top leadership is eroded, and Xi is perceived to have lost his 'mandate' – whether heavenly or not – a loss of faith in existing arrangements can contribute to serious social instability.
The relation between India and Pakistan has always been a complex one. Since the partition of British India, the Indo-Pak relationship has been plagued by suspicion and hostility. The peace talks, proposals and other noticeable steps taken in order to increase the harmony between the two nations allow us to believe that an Indo-Pak war is highly unlikely. Nevertheless, if the unthinkable happens, the damages will be catastrophic on both the sides.
The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change, as climate can be an important determinant for future price trends (32), as well as the short-term variability of prices. Since 2007, the world food equation has been at a precariously low level and, consequently, even small shocks on the supply or demand side of the equation will have large impacts on prices, as experienced in 2008 (62). Food security of the poor is strongly affected by staple food prices, as a large part of an impoverished family’s income has to be spent on staple foods. Climate change is likely to increase food market volatility for both production and supply [see (63) for the supply side]. Food system stability can also be endangered by demand shocks, for instance, when aggressive bioenergy subsidies and quota policies were applied by the political economy (64). These sorts of policy shifts, made in the past decade by the United States and the European Union, have been motivated in part by energy security concerns and partly by climate mitigation objectives (65–67). The resulting destabilization of food markets, which contributed to major food security problems, was therefore partly related to climate change (policy). The 2008 food crisis stemmed from a combination of a general reduction of agricultural productivity and acute policy failures, exacerbated by export restrictions applied by many countries, a lack of transparency in markets, and poor regulation of financial engagement in food commodity markets (68, 69). A broad set of risks needs to be considered, of which climate change is an increasingly important one, that can ripple out to destabilize food systems, resulting in high and volatile food prices that temporarily limit poor people’s food consumption (70–73), financial and economic shocks that lead to job loss and credit constraints (74), and risks that political disruptions and failed political systems cause food insecurity (75). This complex system of risks can assume a variety of patterns that could potentially collide in catastrophic combinations.

As with ethnic and racial profiling in general, the likelihood that a particular politically profiled individual or group is connected with terrorism is minuscule. Actual terrorists can easily conceal their political and religious views, as the September 11 hijackers did.
In No Future Edelman takes on Cornel referencing of futurity in an op-ed for the Boston Globe that he wrote with Sylvia Ann Hewitt titled "A Parent's Bill of Rights."27 The title is disturbingly smug (as if biological parents of the middle class did not already have uncontested rights to their children!), and the editorial is a neoliberal screed on behalf of the culture of the child. But Edelman's critique never considers the topic of race that is central to the actual editorial. West's pro-children agenda aligns with his other concerns about the crises Of African American youth. Edelman's critique of the editorial, with which for the most part I am deeply sympathetic, is flawed insofar as it decontextualizes West's work from the topic that has been so central to his critical interventions: black- ness. In the same way all queers are not the stealth-universal-white-gay- man invoked in queer antirelational formulations, all children are not the privileged white babies to whom contemporary society Caters. Again, there is for me a lot to like in this critique of antireproductive futurism, but in Edelman's theory it is enacted by the active disavowal of a crisis in afrofuturism.2S Theories Of queer temporality that fail to factor in the rela- tional relevance of race or class merely reproduce a crypto-universal white gay subject that is weirdly atemporal—which is to say a subject whose time is a restricted and restricting hollowed-out present free of the need for the challenge Of imagining a futurity that exists beyond the self or the here and now. The question of children hangs heavily when one considers Baraka's present. On August 1 2, 2003, one Of his daughters, Shani Baraka, and her female lover, Rayshon Holmes, were killed by the estranged husband of Wanda pasha, who is also one of Baraka's daughters. 'Ihe thirty-one- and thirty-year-old wome" murders were preceded a few months earlier by another hate crime in Newark, the killing Of fifteen-year-old Sakia Gunn. Gunn was a black transgendered youth who traveled from Hoboken to Greenwich Village and the Christopher Street piers to hang out With other young queers of color. Baraka and his wife, Amina, have in part dealt with the tragic loss of their daughter by turning to activism. The violent fate of their child has alerted them to the systemic violence that faces queer people (and especially young people) Of color, the Barakas have both be- come ardent antiviolence activists speaking out directly on LGBT issues. Real violence has ironically brought Baraka back to a queer world that he had renounced so many years ago. Through his tremendous loss he has decided to further diversify his consistent commitment to activism and social justice to include what can only be understood as queer politics. In the world of The Toilet there are no hate crimes, no lexicon that identifies homophobia per se, but there is the fact of an aggression constantly on the verge of brutal actualization. The mimetic violence resonates across time and to the scene of the loss that the author will endure decades later. "Ibis story from real life is not meant to serve as the proof for my argument. In- deed, the play's highly homoerotic violence is in crucial ways nothing like the misogynist violence against women that befell the dramatist's family or the transgenderphobic violence that ended Gunni young life. I men- tion these tragedies because it makes one simple point. The future is only the stuff of some kids. Racialized kids, queer kids, are not the sovereign princes of futurity. Although Edelman does indicate that the future of the child as futurity is different from the future of actual children, his fram- ing nonetheless accepts and reproduces this monolithic figure of the child that is indeed always already white. He all but ignores the point that Other modes of particularity within the social are constitutive of subjecthood beyond the kind Of jouissance that refuses both narratological meaning and what he understands as the fantasy Of futurity. He anticipates and bristles against his future critics with a precognitive paranoia in footnote 19 of his first chapter. He rightly predicts that some identitarian critics (I suppose that would be me in this instance, despite my ambivalent rela- tion to the concept Of identity) would dismiss his polemic by saying it is determined by his middle-class white gay male positionality. 'Ihis attempt to inoculate himself from those Who engage his polemic does not do the job. In the final analysis, white gay male crypto-identity politics (the re- staging Of whiteness as universal norm via the imaginary negation Of all other identities that position themselves as not white) is beside the point. The deeper point is indeed "political," as, but certainly not more, politi- cal than Edelman's argument. It is important not to hand over futurity to normative white reproductive futurity. That dominant mode of futurity is indeed "winning," but that is all the more reason to call on a utopian po- litical imagination that will enable us to glimpse another time and place: a "not-yet" where queer youths of color actually get to grow up. Utopian and willfully idealistic practices of thought are in order if we are to resist the perils of heteronormative pragmatism and Anglo-normative pessimism. Imagining a queer subject who is abstracted from the Sensuous intersectionalities that mark our experience is an ineffectual way out. Such an escape via singularity is a ticket whose price most cannot afford. The way to deal with the asymmetries and violent frenzies that mark the present is not to forget the future. The here and now is simply not enough. Queerness should and could be about a desire for another way of being in both the world and time, a desire that resists mandates to accept that which is not enough.
Pronouncements of American decline miss the real transformation under way today. What is occurring is not American decline but a dynamic process in which other states are catching up and growing more connected. In an open and rule-based international order, this is what happens. If the architects of the postwar liberal order were alive to see today's system, they would think that their vision had succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Markets and democracy have spread. Societies outside the West are trading and growing. The United States has more alliance partners today than it did during the Cold War. Rival hegemonic states with revisionist and illiberal agendas have been pushed off the global stage. It is difficult to read these world-historical developments as a story of American decline and liberal unraveling. In a way, however, the liberal international order has sown the seeds of its own discontent, since, paradoxically, the challenges facing it now -- the rise of non-Western states and new transnational threats -- are artifacts of its success. But the solutions to these problems -- integrating rising powers and tackling problems cooperatively -- will lead the order's old guardians and new stakeholders to an agenda of renewal. The coming divide in world politics will not be between the United States (and the West) and the non-Western rising states. Rather, the struggle will be between those who want to renew and expand today's system of multilateral governance arrangements and those who want to move to a less cooperative order built on spheres of influence. These fault lines do not map onto geography, nor do they split the West and the non-West. There are passionate champions of the UN, the WTO, and a rule-based international order in Asia, and there are isolationist, protectionist, and anti-internationalist factions in the West. The liberal international order has succeeded over the decades because its rules and institutions have not just enshrined open trade and free markets but also provided tools for governments to manage economic and security interdependence. The agenda for the renewal of the liberal international order should be driven by this same imperative: to reinforce the capacities of national governments to govern and achieve their economic and security goals. As the hegemonic organization of the liberal international order slowly gives way, more states will have authority and status. But this will still be a world that the United States wants to inhabit. A wider array of states will share the burdens of global economic and political governance, and with its worldwide system of alliances, the United States will remain at the center of the global system. Rising states do not just grow more powerful on the global stage; they grow more powerful within their regions, and this creates its own set of worries and insecurities -- which is why states will continue to look to Washington for security and partnership. In this new age of international order, the United States will not be able to rule. But it can still lead.
Robert P. Johnson thought he had a shot at being best man at the wedding of his friend and workout buddy, Christopher J. Billings. Instead, he was indicted federally three weeks before the wedding for conspiring to sell cocaine, based on the account of a confidential informant. When prosecutors provided a glimpse of the evidence against him -- text messages replete with inside jokes -- Johnson knew who his accuser was: Billings. The bride, Johnson learned later, was an ex-girlfriend of the Drug Enforcement Administration boss who initially supervised the investigation. “I guess at the time [Billings] was my best friend,” said Johnson last month, four years after he was found not guilty. “I didn’t understand how someone who I was friends with could do this to me.” Most of the area’s federal drug cases rest, in part, on the accounts of confidential informants who help law enforcement in return for leniency or money, or occasionally out of altruism. Many probes start with an informant and then proceed to surveillance, wiretaps and searches. Sometimes informants’ backgrounds, credibility and connections don’t fit comfortably within guidelines set in Washington. The Post-Gazette has uncovered instances in which informants used to build federal cases were convicted murderers, liars or double agents working with both law enforcement and the targets. One informant with a violent past, used in a DEA case that ended in acquittal, wasn’t put through the federal review process. The results have included the indictment and incarceration of people whose lives were turned upside-down prior to their exonerations. Only nine people have been fully acquitted in federal court cases brought in Pittsburgh since 2009, but four of those not guilty verdicts involved shaky informants. Two of those exonerated defendants first spent years behind bars. U.S. Attorney David Hickton, whose office has prosecuted about 3,000 people since 2009, said cooperators, including informants, “are essential to obtaining convictions in nearly all significant cases.” He declined to discuss specific cases but added that “the naked information supplied by a cooperator forms only a part of the evidence which we obtained through many means, through hundreds or sometimes thousands of hours of very hard investigative work.” Judge Stephen S. Trott, of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, an authority on informants since he served as associate attorney general in the 1980s, said they are necessary but shouldn’t be the centerpieces of a prosecution. “These informants are very good at fooling the [prosecutors] and everybody else,” Judge Trott said. “They’re basically sociopaths. … There are too many cases when informants blow up in people’s faces because they don’t know how to use them.” The Case of the Confidential Informant To tell the truth An informant system combining criminality, human frailty and strict secrecy has come under fire following two cases closed in Massachusetts last year. Mobster James “Whitey” Bulger, 85, was sentenced to two life sentences for involvement in 11 murders and other crimes, some committed while he was an FBI informant. Mob boss Mark Rossetti, 55, was sentenced to 12 years on charges including crimes of violence committed while he was reporting to the FBI. “Right now you’ve got law enforcement making all of these decisions. No one is looking over their shoulder,” said U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Boston Democrat who has proposed congressional oversight of federal use of informants. The public only sees “when a case blows up.” The Post-Gazette reviewed 1,329 affidavits -- sworn statements written by law enforcement professionals and filed in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh from 2009 through 2014. Most of the affidavits were submitted in pursuit of judges’ approval of warrants to search or seize property, get data on the use or location of a phone, place a tracking device on a vehicle or in a package, or to support a criminal complaint. The Post-Gazette identified 384 cases, many with multiple defendants, that stemmed from the affidavits. Of those cases, 148 were built in part on the work of confidential informants. Nearly two-thirds of the cases investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration involved informants. The informants’ identities typically aren’t revealed to judges or the defense. Their names emerge only in those rare instances in which the defendant goes to trial and the secret source must be called as a witness. Even then, background on the informant is often kept under wraps until days before he or she testifies. The affidavits reveal an informant mill in which suspects became informants and helped agents to bust others, who then in turn became informants aimed at other targets. In late 2008, the DEA approached Liam S. Doherty, now 35, a mortgage broker then living in Penn Hills, and asked him if he was selling cocaine. Mr. Doherty handed over about two ounces of cocaine and two bottles of pills, according to his testimony at Johnson’s trial. He named Billings as his cocaine source. Mr. Doherty told agents that he owed Billings money for cocaine he’d received earlier. Over two months, the DEA gave Mr. Doherty $18,400 in government funds, which he paid to Billings to cover the debts and buy cocaine, as much as nine ounces at a time. Why use government funds to pay a drug debt? The informant’s debt to his drug source creates an opportunity to start a case, said Steve Kaufman, chief of the Criminal Division of Mr. Hickton’s office. ”It’s not like at that point [the informant is] just going to pay off the debt and walk away.” In March 2009, agents searched Billings’ house, and found steroids and creatine, an amino acid ingested by bodybuilders and sometimes used to dilute cocaine. Billings wouldn’t name his cocaine source until his fiancee, Leanne Balistrieri, showed up. “Well, I, I, I took her in the room, Leanne Balistrieri, ‘What should I do?’” Billings testified. He said he knew she’d dated a DEA man but didn’t know if he was involved in the bust. “She asked me and it was, like I said, I like whispered, ‘Bob.’ And she kind of screams, ‘Who?’” At that point, Billings testified, he said to her: “Bobby Johnson.” “It was pretty much right there when I decided to cooperate.” Ms. Balistrieri, who did not testify and has divorced Billings, said in September that she told him only: “You have to tell the truth.” Consider the source “You must provide truthful information to the [investigating agency] at all times.” That’s the first thing an agent is supposed to tell a newly recruited secret source, according to the Department of Justice Guidelines Regarding the Use of Confidential Informants, issued in 2001. The guidelines are nearly 10,000 words of Department of Justice recommendations to its internal investigators, plus agents of the DEA and U.S. Marshals Service. The FBI has its own guidelines, released in 2006. “One of the things that [the department’s] rules and guidelines attempt to preserve, and attempt to ensure, is the reliability of the informant and their suitability as a witness,” said Alexandra Natapoff, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who researches informant policy. The 2001 guidelines tell agents to review a prospective informant’s criminal history and substance abuse, and whether the person is “reasonably believed to pose a danger to the public.” The FBI’s guidelines also call for a review of criminal history. Nothing in that history, though, bars the person from becoming a registered informant. To build a case against 14 people accused of selling heroin and methamphetamine -- and possessing guns while doing it -- in Allegheny County’s western suburbs, the FBI used informants with backgrounds including violence and dishonesty. Informants in the case against the crew allegedly led by Neil Thomas, 30, of North Fayette, made drug buys that led to a wiretap and searches. Thomas has pleaded not guilty. One of the three informants “has prior felony convictions for drug crimes, criminal homicide, retail theft, and false reports to law enforcement, among other crimes,” according to an FBI agent’s affidavit. Another had prior theft, drug and resisting arrest convictions, was charged but not convicted of forgery theft by deception and false identification to law enforcement, and was cooperating for “judicial consideration” on new theft, marijuana and gun charges. U.S. Rep. Lynch said he can understand law enforcement using, as an informant, someone with an assault conviction. “But certainly homicide is probably a non-starter, right? We can probably agree on that.” Though federal prosecutors said it’s rare to use someone with a homicide conviction as an informant, they argued against a blanket ban. “There might be a person who has a homicide conviction for shooting someone and there might be a person who has a homicide conviction for vehicular homicide,” said Mr. Hickton. Either way, he said, “The person by law has paid their debt to society by serving their sentence.” Though that person may face “tough questions” if called to testify at trial, law enforcement shouldn’t automatically reject their help, he said. “The question is not what the guy’s background is,” said Judge Trott, “but can [the information] be corroborated.” Often an informant’s work is corroborated through other investigative tools. It’s not always easy. In their takedown of the Manchester OGs street gang, blamed for heroin dealing and dozens of North Side shootings, the FBI used an informant who had to be reined in. Through a wiretap, agents learned that while the informant was working with them, he or she was making unauthorized calls to the leader of the gang. The source, according to the affidavit, “was admonished to refrain from engaging in any criminal activity and was once again advised that his cooperation must be truthful.” All 19 defendants were convicted. Two were sentenced to two decades in prison.
At a House hearing, Philippe Cousteau, grandson of legendary ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau, urged Congress to reinstate the offshore drilling bans that until last fall had been in effect for 25 years in Atlantic and Pacific coastal waters.¶ "It's absolutely critical for the health of the oceans," said Cousteau, a board member of the advocacy group Ocean Conservancy. "Oil spills still occur."¶ Actor Ted Danson, a founder and board member of Oceana, an ocean advocacy group, said offshore drilling is "flirting with disaster" because of potential oil spills not only at drilling rigs, but in transporting the oil produced.¶ Danson said the country should be moving away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and energy from tidal waves because of the threats of climate change, which he said is another threat to ocean health.¶ Tourism and fishing industry spokesmen from North Carolina, Florida and California said they are worried offshore drilling would impact billions of dollars a year fishing and tourism industries.¶ "We cannot afford any kind of spill. ... We can't take the risk," D.T. Minich, executive director of the St. Petersburg/Clearwater, Fla. visitor's bureau, told the House panel.¶ W.F. "Zeek" Grader Jr., executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Association, said he's not so worried about spills, but that exploratory seismic activities and drilling rigs would "kill fish... scare fish and make it impossible for fishing operations to be held."¶ But Jefferson Angers, president of the Center for Coastal Conservation in Louisiana said: "The fishing and oil and gas industries have coexisted in Louisiana for half a century and they've worked well together."¶ On restoring the broad moratorium, "it may be the ship has already sailed," said Rahall, adding that the issue is, "do we need buffer areas, do we need certain areas off limits?"¶ Rep. Doc Hastings of Washington, the House Resources Committee's top Republican, countered that expanded offshore drilling is "about creating good American jobs" and reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil and the OPEC oil cartel.¶ But energy experts acknowledge that any new offshore oil development would do little to spur short-term job creation and that it would take years for new leases to be issued and another 5 to 7 years before oil would begin to flow from any new discoveries.
Both political parties need to make “a series of compromises” to develop an energy plan to hasten American energy independence, Midland Rep. Michael Conaway said Tuesday.
COLONIALISM IS NOT SETTLER COLONIALISM Colonisers and settler colonisers want essentially different things.3 True; in practice, the two stances are often intimately intertwined and there are elements of both demands in most statements uttered by both colonisers and settler colonisers. Moreover, this confusion is necessarily compounded by the fact that in any given colonial setting there often are different groups of colonisers demanding different things of the colonised while entertaining different definitions of what may constitute ‘labour’ (i.e., physical, spiritual, consumption, sexual, reproductive labour, and so on). Similarly, different settler colonisers may disagree on what indigenous people ‘going away’ should actually mean (i.e., being physically eliminated or displaced, having one’s cultural practices erased, being ‘absorbed’, ‘assimilated’ or ’amalgamated’ in the wider population, but the list could go on). In the end, what is being said in the context of a sometime contradictory cacophony is: ‘you, work for me while we wait for you to disappear’, and ‘you, move on so that you can work for me’.
America’s critical infrastructure—the utilities, refineries, military defense systems, water treatment plants and other facilities on which we depend every day—has become its soft underbelly, the place where we are now most vulnerable to attack. Over the past 25 years, hundreds of thousands of analog controls in these facilities have been replaced with digital systems. Digital controls provide facility operators and managers with remote visibility and control over every aspect of their operations, including the flows and pressures in refineries, the generation and transmission of power in the electrical grid, and the temperatures in nuclear cooling towers. In doing so, they have made industrial facilities more efficient and more productive. But the same connectivity that managers use to collect data and control devices allows cyber attackers to get into control system networks to steal sensitive information, disrupt processes, and cause damage to equipment. Hackers, including those in China, Russia and the Middle East, have taken notice. While early control system breaches were random, accidental infections, industrial control systems today have become the object of targeted attacks by skilled and persistent adversaries. Industrial control systems are being targeted The recently discovered Industrial Control System modules of the HAVEX trojan are one example. The malware infiltrated an indeterminate number of critical facilities by attaching itself to software updates distributed by control system manufacturers. When facilities downloaded the updates to their network, HAVEX used open communication standards to collect information from control devices and send that information to the attackers for analysis. This type of attack represents a significant threat to confidential production data and corporate intellectual property and may also be an early indicator of an advanced targeted attack on an organization’s production control systems. Other hacks represent a direct threat to the safety of U.S. citizens. Earlier this year, the FBI released information on Ugly Gorilla, a Chinese attacker who invaded the control systems of utilities in the United States. While the FBI suspects this was a scouting mission, Ugly Gorilla gained the cyber keys necessary for access to systems that regulate the flow of natural gas. Considering that cyber attackers are numerous and persistent—for every one you see there are a hundred you don’t—those developments should sound alarms among executives at companies using industrial controls and with the people responsible for protecting American citizens from attacks. To their credit, both businesses and the U.S. government have begun to take action; however, neither is adequately addressing the core of the issue. The threat isn’t static Businesses continue to believe that cybersecurity issues can be addressed solely through technology. The problem was created by technology so the solution must be more technology, they reason, ignoring the spirit of Einstein’s observation that “no problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.” Technology is static and the threat is not. Hackers will always find a way to beat technology-based solutions. That’s why we have to do more than create barriers to keep out intruders. We have to man our digital borders with people who have the same skill and determination as the attackers similar to the use of technology, the ability to regulate a solution is inherently limited. Regulation creates a compliance mentality in which policies and investments are based on achieving and maintaining compliance. Compliance is predictable, which makes it the hacker’s best friend. Lack in security professionals who understand both digital security and control system technology Legislation (HR 3696) has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that would increase the sharing of information related to control system breaches to better arm security professionals to prevent future breaches. That is a worthwhile goal; unfortunately, there is a dire lack of security professionals with an understanding of both digital security and control system technology to benefit from this information sharing. Filling this gap is where the lion’s share of the cybersecurity effort must go. It is estimated in the latest Project SHINE report that the United States has more than half a billion control system devices connected to the Internet. The SANS Institute, the largest cybersecurity training organization in the world, estimates that in the U.S. power industry alone thousands of new or existing control systems security professionals must be deployed or further developed in the next five years to adequately address the challenge of control system security within the electric sector.
The U.S. biopharmaceutical industry is not only a world leader in the development of new medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics and one of our nation’s top performing industry innovation drivers, but is also a highly valuable industry in terms of its economic contributions and impacts. The economic impacts, or more precisely the revenue and expenditure impacts, of the biopharmaceutical industry are typically measured by using the well-established regional economic analysis technique of input/ output (I/O) analysis, which tracks the revenues of a sector and the related economic activity of suppliers to the sector and its personnel. This analysis uses a custom IMPLAN I/O model to quantify the interrelationships between the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry and the remaining sectors of the U.S. economy. Economic impacts consist of three types: direct effects (the specific impact of biopharmaceutical industry expenditures in the first round of spending), indirect effects (the impact of expenditures by suppliers to the biopharmaceutical industry), and induced effects (the additional economic impact of the spending of biopharmaceutical industry employees and suppliers’ employees in the overall economy that can be attributed to the direct biopharmaceutical industry expenditures). Taken together, these three impact effects combine to form the total impacts. In other words, the I/O analysis models the “ripple effect” that originates from direct biopharmaceutical industry expenditures in the economy, flows through industry suppliers as they buy additional inputs, and through workers who spend their wages. The Economic Impact of the U.S. Biopharmaceutical Industry on the Nation The overall output impact, typically referred to as the “total economic impact” of the biopharmaceutical industry on the U.S. economy, totalled more than $1.2 trillion in 2014.16 This total impact includes $558 billion in direct effects of biopharmaceutical businesses sales and $659 billion in indirect and induced effects—meaning that every $1.00 in output generated by the biopharmaceutical industry generated an additional $1.18 in output in other sectors of the economy (TABLE 3). This significant output multiplier of 2.18 is due to the high value-added nature of the industry, its extensive The overall output impact, typically referred to as the “total economic impact” of the biopharmaceutical industry on the U.S. economy, totalled more than $1.2 trillion in 2014. Definition of Impact Variables EMPLOYMENT: The number of individuals whose employment is due, totally (direct employment) or in part (indirect or induced employment) to the economic effects of the industry. LABOR (PERSONAL) INCOME: Salaries, wages, and the full cost of benefits including non-cash payments received by individuals in the economy. Includes employee compensation and sole proprietor income. VALUE-ADDED: The difference between an industry’s total output and the cost of its intermediate inputs; sometimes referred to as the industry’s “Contribution to GDP”. OUTPUT: The dollar value of production (i.e., sales). PERSONAL TAX REVENUE: The dollar value of taxes generated due to the creation of personal income; includes company paid portion of social security taxes. 11 supply chain relationships, and the industry’s higher wage jobs. This total economic impact represented more than 3.8 percent of total U.S. output.17 The revenues of the biopharmaceutical industry are responsible for supporting more than 4.4 million jobs throughout the U.S. economy. These jobs consist of the nearly 854,000 jobs directly in the industry and an additional 3.6 million indirect and induced jobs in 2014. For every one biopharmaceutical industry job, the industry supports an additional 4.21 jobs, for a total employment multiplier of 5.21. Together, the biopharmaceutical industry and the workforce of its suppliers and other impacted segments of the economy received $311 billion in wages and benefits in 2014. The biopharmaceutical industry also is an important generator of federal, state, and local government revenues through the wages and benefits provided to its employees. The impact analysis shows that the incomes of biopharmaceutical industry workers, directly and through the multiplier effect, generated $67 billion in personal tax revenues—nearly $9 billion in state and local personal tax revenue and more than $58 billion in federal personal tax revenues in 2014.
Discrimination and Gender Stereotypes Undermine Latinas’ Educational Opportunities. A. Latinas face cultural stereotypes and a lack of role models in their daily lives. All girls, including Latinas, receive subtle and not-so-subtle messages about women’s roles in society. But gender and ethnic stereotypes can negatively affect Latinas’ educational performance in particular.62 Stereotypes may portray Latinas as submissive underachievers and caretakers, and too often these can be reinforced—albeit perhaps unintentionally—by family, school personnel, and the media.63 Because of these stereotypes, many “low income Latinas do not foresee their possibilities for doing well in school and pursuing post-secondary education or careers, and so leave school and start a family.”64 More egalitarian views about gender roles, on the other hand, have been found to contribute positively to Latinas’ selfimage and self-esteem and also to predict higher academic achievement and grades.65 1. Latinas are influenced by family and societal expectations. While some of the girls in our study said they did not notice a difference between their parents’ hopes for them and their brothers, other participants noted that parents do have differing expectations for their sons and daughters. A staff member from an after-school program, for example, said: My dad’s side of the family is Latino so I’ve seen personally it’s just a thing that’s there. Even female teachers are not given much respect by boys in the classroom, and the girls aren’t given respect by the boys. [There’s a] hierarchy, [it’s] most apparent with siblings—I had a girl in my class who had 6 siblings and she was being encouraged to be a dental tech or something with hair, and she said she couldn’t go to college because, she said, my parents can only afford to send the boys to college. A high school counselor for at-risk students said that the attitudes of some Latinas about high school and post-secondary options stem from their parents’ gender bias: I think I see where Hispanics usually tend to as far as going to college. Some, not all, come from families that think the female role is staying home and not going to college and having a career. Staying home and having a family is first and foremost. Similarly, a girl who is currently in college talked about feeling limited by what she felt were patriarchal constraints promoted by cultural norms: For example, the idea that you’re not supposed to move out of your home until you get married . . . [t]his limits your academic ambitions and forces you to settle to attend a school close to home that may or may not be the best choice for you. Some girls whom we interviewed demonstrated a determination to prove the stereotypes wrong. Some are motivated to try harder precisely to avoid the future that others envision for them. For example, one student, asked whether there was anyone in particular whom she relied on for support or advice about school, said: Not really. I take my family’s experiences and my friends’ experiences and I set that in my mind to not be like that—like not have kids or get pregnant—and no one in my family has graduated from high school. In too many instances, however, Latina girls internalize these gender stereotypes. A staff member at an after-school program for Latinas in middle school noted that the prevalence of gender stereotypes in the Latino community can cause some Latinas to “get the message that their job is to be pretty and have babies.” In addition, an after-school program coordinator observed that she hears about Latina girls “getting into violent relationships and being abused by the boyfriend in high school, verbally and physically.” In fact, in a 2003 survey by the CDC, 9.2% of Latina high school students reported that they had been victims of physical dating violence. While this percentage is less than the percentage of Black girls who report dating violence (14%), it exceeds the rate at which White girls experience such violence (7.5%).66 2. Many Latinas lack role models to inspire and advise them on reaching educational and career goals. According to some of the school and program staff we interviewed, one of the primary challenges facing Latinas in school today is the absence of female role models or inspiring influences. For example, the director of a mentoring program for Latinas said that the absence of good role models profoundly undermines Latinas’ self-esteem: One of the things I see all the time [is] a lack of pride, even [in] the concept of Latina. In some communities where they have been migrant workers and they play a certain role in that community, and they never [have] seen themselves as the professional or the doctor in that community. That really plays down on them and they don’t see themselves doing that. Programming and Latina empowerment and education really teaches them that and changes that. Someone in front of them who looks like them and came from where they came from, that makes it a lot more real. A staff member from an after-school program, who previously taught at a middle school, also commented on the importance of role models: I was working with eighth graders in particular and their families. A lot of them don’t believe that they can make it. They don’t have a lot of positive role models and positive influence. Girls are expected to go to work and help out with their families. Or get married and have babies. . . . Even in the eighth grade we had about four or five girls go in for pregnancy tests. In our interviews, many girls said that neither their parents nor others in their families had gone to college, so they lacked an educational role model and also someone to go to for guidance within the family. Roughly 40% of the girls we surveyed indicated that their mothers either had not finished or had not even attended high school. And Census data show that in comparison to Whites, Latinos are far less likely to have parents who went to college: while almost four in ten White children have parents who attended college, only one in ten Latino children do.67 As one teacher explained, “get[ting Latinas] into the real world” is key to giving them hope for the future and role models with whom they can identify: I guess sometimes I see that they realize they have an option and that they can go forward and graduate . . . by giving them actual experience and taking them out in the community and have other people tell them. We connect with the tri-city Hispanic Chamber [of Commerce] and they see other people making it and they see a connection, then they have more drive. Peer influences are also critical. More than half of our survey respondents reported that they had friends who had dropped out. For those trying to stay in school and succeed, the loss of part of a peer network can be discouraging and make it even harder to achieve academic goals. Aside from the motivational benefits, there also is a strong practical need for educational and career role models. Many students we interviewed lacked any understanding of their options for post-secondary education or the prerequisites to attain it, much less first-hand knowledge of the many benefits of attending college. I have a lot of people tell me “you’re going to end up pregnant.” B. Latinas face the intersection of ethnicity and sex discrimination—and related barriers—at school. Despite the prohibitions of federal law,68 Latinas also face gender and ethnicity discrimination—and sometimes the intersection of those two types of discrimination—by teachers, school staff, and their peers. When teachers and others in school demonstrate a lack of cultural sensitivity or rely on ethnic, racial, or gender stereotypes, student engagement and learning is hindered, increasing the risk that the students subject to discrimination will do poorly, fall behind, and drop out.69 1. Latinas face explicit discrimination based on their ethnicity. The school and program staff we interviewed cited incidents of discrimination as barriers to Latinas’ success. A school employee assigned to work with at-risk students said that discrimination is “a challenge for the girls, they don’t feel as comfortable in the classroom setting maybe. Racism they feel.” She then shared this story: One student brought in a worksheet that was racist, and I gave it to an administrator. It came out of a workbook—it had a picture of a Mexican family with a sombrero, donkey, and wagon, and you had to complete math problems and figure out the puzzle with a saying. The student came in and said, “[Counselor’s name], how racist is this?” I took it to the administrators and told them that their teachers may not see it as a problem but this student did. They did not realize until they saw it. Eighty-seven of the students who responded to our written survey and several of the girls we interviewed stated that they had been treated differently at school because of their ethnicity. One student reported that a teacher declined to acknowledge her complaint that a classmate had called her “a wetback.” As a result, in addition to feeling targeted by her classmate’s use of the epithet, she felt isolated and unsupported. The student explained: I had already felt like I was maybe out of place—like people had nicer stuff than me and they made me feel like nothing compared to them, the 2. Latinas face unwelcoming school environments. Beyond explicitly discriminatory treatment, Latinas often face policies that create an unwelcoming atmosphere at school. Because feelings of alienation and marginalization have been linked to dropout,70 enabling students to embrace their ethnic identity in a welcoming, multicultural school environment may be integral to Latinas’ academic achievement. A number of students we interviewed reported not feeling comfortable speaking Spanish with friends at school, and some felt unable to embrace their own identities as Latinas with pride, particularly when the school they attended was predominantly White or African-American. Some students also reported being prohibited by their teachers from speaking Spanish at school; one survey respondent said she was suspended for doing so. Girls at one high school felt disappointed that there is only one club focused on Latino students, even though Latinos, and primarily bilingual Latinos, comprise about 25% of the school population. Some of the students also complained that their schools and curricula reflected a lack of appreciation for Latino heritage—noting, for example, that their school sponsored several activities and assignments for African-American History month, while offering no assignments and only one activity in recognition of Hispanic Heritage month. 3. For Latinas, gender stereotypes exacerbate discrimination based on ethnicity. Latinas report that they often find that they are subject to stereotypes and expectations at school that relate to their status as women in a traditionally patriarchal society. Gender stereotypes limit the range of “possible selves” that girls can envision becoming because they may internalize the images or expectations that they see around them.71 As researchers have noted, for example: “Pregnancy, housework, and stereotypes of ‘women’s work’ and career options have an impact on girls’ possible selves in ways that differ from boys’ possible selves.”72 Our respondents told us stories that illustrated how the intersection of ethnicity and gender create enhanced barriers for them. Girls in one of our focus groups, for example, reported that a non-Latino teacher in the school asked a ninth grade Latina student sitting with her friends in the cafeteria: “Why aren’t you pregnant yet?” One of the girls we interviewed who was the oldest of several siblings and often shouldered parenting duties, stated: “I have a lot of people tell me ‘you’re going to end up pregnant.’” A college student who responded to our survey wrote that she felt she was treated differently as a Latina when she was in high school: Generally, academic expectations are lower. You are supposed to get married and have kids and not set high academic goals for yourself. For example, at one point when I told a teacher I was heading away to college, he said he gave me two years before I was married and pregnant. Even those who are successful at school feel the pressure of their teachers’ assumptions and diminished expectations. Another student who is currently in college stated: I did well in high school. . . . I think that for that reason staff at the high school treated me as if I was better than my other Latina peers. Instead of feeling good, it felt unfair because I knew the staff expected less of me (as a Latina) and that was the reason for their better treatment . . . . I went through high school knowing I wasn’t having the same experience as my peers (they were tracked, left to linger without getting any real support for improvement). I was the “token” Latina achiever and thereby treated more like my White peers. Other students reported that they were treated differently by their peers, particularly where they were one of only a few Latinas in an environment dominated by White or African-American students. This peer discrimination, too, can turn students off to school. As one student who attended a mostlyWhite school explained: Being Latina, I felt so out of place in middle school . . . . And I never liked talking about my family, my background . . . . I just didn’t really want to be at school. 4. Some Latinas face sexual harassment at school. Research has shown that girls are more likely than boys to feel sexually harassed at school, and girls are more likely to be impacted negatively by the harassment.73 In addition to suffering psychologically, girls who are victims of sexual harassment in general are more likely than boys to report not wanting to go to school, trying to change seats in class to avoid a harasser, or not being able to pay attention or participate as much in class.74 These patterns can contribute to poor academic performance and eventually lead a student to drop out.75 Despite the fact that the vast majority of girls responding to our survey said they had never been sexually harassed at school, 20 girls reported having been touched offensively or harassed verbally while at school. Any instances of sexual harassment must be taken seriously by schools.76 Considering that incidents of sexual harassment often go unreported, more research may be appropriate to evaluate the true extent of sexual harassment of Latinas in school.
We can however consider that any state contemplating a clandestine programme, or in this case one or more underground nuclear tests, must make certain calculations about its ability to conceal all of the evidence all of the time from a watchful international community. Balancing risks—military and strategic gains against the political, diplomatic and economic costs—is not easy. A potential violator has to be sure that his preparations to test, as well as its conduct and aftermath, can be concealed from the international community indefinitely. In the case of the CTBT, it will be a combination of national technical means (NTMs) and the treaty’s International Monitoring System (IMS) and on-site inspections that place a series of high hurdles in the face of a would-be proliferator. Tripping over just one can compromise his plans and negate any conceivable military advantage that he might have been hoping to derive from a clandestine test, or tests. It is worth recalling here that Sir William Penney, the leader of the UK’s nuclear weapons programme in the 1950s and early 1960s, advised Harold Macmillan’s government in 1962 that even though the Soviet Union might be confident in avoiding the detection of one test under the then envisaged verification system, it could not be at all sure that a series of, say, three tests would go unnoticed. Penney’s view was that one test would not alter the strategic balance and so the risk of a test ban treaty was worth taking as one would need a series of tests to obtain a strategically significant advantage. M ore than fifty years later we have the CTBT’s IMS, which, as of August 2011, has 86 per cent of its primary stations (including seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound and radionuclide stations), 83 per cent of its auxiliary seismic stations and 63 per cent of its radionuclide laboratories certified. Their detection capabilities are immeasurably superior to those planned by the 1958 Geneva seismic experts’ meeting. Simulations of global detection thresholds today, measured in terms of equivalent nuclear-yield in kilotons of TNT (kt), suggest that the IMS network is capable of detecting and identifying, worldwide, explosions fired close- coupled underground in hard rock, in the atmosphere, and in the ocean, with a yield equal to or more than one kiloton. In many areas of the world, such as continental Eurasia, the detection threshold is significantly less than one kiloton. In the 1977–1980 Tripartite Test Ban Treaty negotiations, UK and US scientists took the view The CTBT: Verification and Deterrence2 that it would only be yields of around ten kilotons that would permit meaningful developments in new warhead design. Any state contemplating a clandestine test has to be sure that, even assuming its preparations go undetected (it can take about a year to prepare for an underground test), it still must find the right geological conditions on its territory in a reasonably remote area. It has to be sure, too, that it can stem a borehole or tunnel effectively to guarantee no venting of radioactive particles or radioactive noble gases that could be picked up by IMS radionuclide stations. Such a task would be challenging for a state with no prior experience of underground testing. Then there is the small matter of the seismic stations— primary and auxiliary—detecting the event and the strong likelihood that it will be subsequently correctly identified as an explosion from the Treaty’s International Data Centre (IDC) Reviewed Events Bulletin. How convincing an explanation could a state provide when pressed for clarification under the Treaty’s Article IV provisions? Could it be absolutely confident that it could conjure up a fool-proof cover story that would hoodwink all of the treaty’s states parties? This is where we first begin to see that the more effective the verification system and the greater the integration of the elements that combine to make it up, the greater the level of deterrence of non-compliance is. A regime that can demonstrate a very high level of technical reliability, coverage and sensitivity presents a formidable obstacle to anyone who wants to cheat. The IMS does that. A state might hope that the CTBT Organisation’s Executive Council would fail to act on the compelling evidence presented by the IDC as well as any supporting information from states parties NTMs and other sources (such as commercial satellite data) and vote against an on-site inspection. However, could any state guarantee that this would indeed be the case? Just how confident ahead of time could it be? As Tibor Toth— the Provisional Technical Secretariat (PTS) Executive Secretary—has pointed out, the very nature of the Treaty’s verification regime will be democratic in that the information behind an inspection request is derived from an independent system whose results are open to all states parties. There may, therefore, be very strong pressures to respond to a well-substantiated compliance concern, which it would be politically much more difficult to ignore or dismiss. Building an on-site inspection capability for the CTBT is a demanding and lengthy process—but such a capability provides the one clear way of confirming that an event that triggered an inspection was a nuclear test conducted in violation of the treaty’s Article I prohibitions. Effective inspections require a well-equipped, trained and experienced cadre of inspectors and an ability to deploy to the field promptly. If the future Technical Secretariat cannot meet these criteria then the OSI regime is a paper tiger. However, major strides have been taken by the PTS and some states signatories in recent years and efforts are continuing on building up an initial capability that would be fit for purpose on entry-into-force of the treaty. There will be a large-scale OSI exercise Integrated Field Exercise in 2014 that will be a key milestone in the development of the Treaty’s OSI regime. OSIs present a violator with an array of techniques and technologies that will make it immensely difficult to be sure that absolutely all incriminating traces of illegal activity can be concealed for up to the 130 days that an inspection could last. Deployment of these techniques and technologies in an integrated and intelligent manner provides a potent tool for detecting non-compliance. And, if the traces cannot be concealed, finding sustainable and convincing technical explanations that will persuade not just the inspectors but the Executive Council back in Vienna is no easy matter. The Council will review the final inspection report and determine whether any non-compliance has occurred. Knowing that the treaty’s OSI capability is effective and would stand a very good chance of uncovering facts strongly suggestive of non-compliance, a cheating state will have to obstruct the inspectors in the field. A systematic pattern of evasion, delay, obstruction, obfuscation and down-right hostility tells its own story, especially since inspectors are allowed to comment on the co-operation (or lack thereof ) provided by an Inspected State Party in their final inspection report. Even a remote chance of detection is a difficult thing for a would-be violator to guard against. Moreover, the greater the level of uncertainty in the mind of such a state, the greater the role that OSIs play in the deterrent effect of the treaty’s overall verification regime. During the 1977–1980 tripartite test ban treaty nego- tiations the UK noted that: ‘Ther e is no known remote method of determining unambiguously whether an underground event was man-made in origin and, if so, was due to a nuclear explosion. Such conclusive evidence is only obtainable b y a n o n-the-spot i nvestigation i nto t he p resence of radioactive materials. Provision for OSI would help deter clandestine testing by posing a threat that it would be identified as such; OSI would also enhance the confidence of all parties to the treaty that its provisions were being observed.’ This statement remains valid today. 1 The CTBT verification regime—comprising the IMS stations (i.e. primary seismic, auxiliary seismic, hyrdoacoustic, infrasound and radionuclide, including stations with radioactive noble gas detection capabilities), the International Data Centre, National Data Centres, consultations and clarification procedures and on-site inspections armed with an array of detection techniques and technologies—presents a formidable set of obstacles for a would-be violator to surmount. And in this equation we should not overlook the role that can be played by NTMs—remote sensing data such as multispectral and infrared images to give but one example. Nor should we forget that science and technology does not stand still and we can confidently expect that the capabilities of all aspects of the verification regime will increase. In particular, as the June 2011 Science and Technology for the CTBT Conference in Vienna noted, progress in sensors, networks and observational technologies as well as in computing and processing offer promising benefits for the efficacy of all components of the treaty’s verification regime. We might still not know exactly what deters in deterrence in the context of preventing non-compliance in arms control and disarmament agreements, but in the context of the CTBT the negotiators designed an integrated system that will clearly complicate the plans of any state thinking that it could evade that system successfully and derive a meaningful political, military or strategic advantage from doing so. The overall regime must inevitably impact on the calculations of a wouldbe evader, and the higher the assurance of detection the more uncertain he must be that he can get away with cheating. Deterrence of non-compliance is therefore strengthened.
The United States isn’t quite as reliant on foreign oil as it used to be.¶ Workers in the Bakken oil fields, North Dakota (Washington Post)¶ Imports of crude oil and other petroleum products are on pace to drop to 6 million barrels per day by 2014, according to new forecasts by the Energy Information Administration. That’s the lowest level since 1987. It’s also just half as much liquid fuel as the country was importing back in 2005, at 12.5 million barrels per day. ¶ So what’s responsible for the drop? For starters, the United States is producing more of its own crude. New drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing for shale have helped companies access “tight oil” in places like North Dakota and Texas. The EIA expects that to continue for the foreseeable future (though be wary of wild claims that the United States will soon surpass Saudi Arabia in oil production):¶ Source: EIA¶ Source: EIA¶ And the less-noticed flip side is that Americans are using less oil. Consumption of liquid fuels plummeted during the recession, and it isn’t expected to rebound anytime soon. The EIA projects that Americans will be driving slightly more over the next few years as the economy recovers, but that will be offset by more-efficient vehicles and the retirement of older cars and trucks:¶ liquid fuels consumption¶ Combine those two trends together, and U.S. imports are falling rapidly. By 2014, the EIA expects the country to import just 32 percent of its oil, down from 60 percent in 2005. ¶ Now, it’s worth being clear about precisely what sorts of benefits this will bring. Lower   imports do help shrink the U.S. trade deficit. And a booming domestic oil industry can certainly bolster the economy — in 2011, the oil and natural gas industries directly generated roughly $481 billion in economic activity, according to a recent estimate from PriceWaterhouseCoopers.¶
Children’s social and emotional development has often been called the “missing piece” of America’s education system. Yet a large body of research shows that social and emotional learning (SEL) approaches— such as those that teach self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decisionmaking—are associated with students’ long-term academic and career success. SEL interventions can be powerful components of positive school change. Studies have identified benefits ranging from improved classroom behavior, increased reading and math achievement, higher graduation rates, and increased ability to handle stress.2
Impediments to a regional arrangement do, of course, exist. The political¶  unpopularity of immigration in the United States is one. Demographic¶ differences are another.

In addition, the staying power of¶  anti-Mexican sentiment in the United States should not be underestimated.¶ It has a lengthy history and is enduring.

Initially, many Americans will feel reassured that their checking and savings accounts are backed by federal deposit insurance. Over time, the failure of more and more banks is likely to weigh on confidence and boost anxiety. Spurred by job losses and personal hardships, as well as by gloomy reports and emotionally charged rumors, people will increasingly worry if their funds are at risk. As a consequence, even some prudently managed institutions will end up with the same fate as the fictional Last National Bank.
When developing countries look to the West, they see growing disillusionment among its electorates, austerity and rising inequality. The West's uncertainty about its own future serves to magnify, even glorify, the Chinese success story for developing economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America. It will not come as a surprise if more turn to China for lessons in economic development. The West has been painfully slow to react. Instead of using the financial crisis as an opportunity for reflection, and to identify those elements of its economic system that simply are not working, leading Western economies continue to promote neo-liberalism as the only way forward. The consequence of inaction threatens the future of democracy. The West is losing the argument, while the China model, despite its widening wealth gap, human rights abuses and disregard for the democratic process, is gaining credibility. The developing world sees that a Chinese leadership, unbothered by the inconvenience of elections and true public accountability, can create a long-term economic plan and follow it through uninterrupted. While opening up its economy to the outside world, the government has retained a high level of control over strategic industries: energy, telecoms and banking, to name three. The developing world sees the fundamental advantage of this type of government intervention: business and trade can be used to bolster the regime and strengthen China's position in the international community. As US journalist Joshua Kurlantzick notes, when China sees an investment opportunity overseas, it can compel its major banks to boost lending to Chinese companies operating in that area. "In short, the China model sees commerce as a means to promote national interests," he observes. By contrast, a widening gap between the rich and poor is causing many to doubt the validity of the Western model. Many Westerners are increasingly insecure about their own values and the health and sustainability of their societies. And many Western governments are unwilling to accept that present levels of inequality harm, rather than promote, innovation and entrepreneurship. At the very least, the West needs to acknowledge the huge damage that neo-liberalism has inflicted on democracy over the past 30 years. Many economists, not just on the far left, now indict the Reagan-Thatcher project of neo-liberalism for reversing the great postwar, baby-boom march towards equal opportunity. Neo-liberalism has become so pernicious that the accepted belief, promoted by advocates of free market fundamentalism, is that the West came to dominate the world because it embraced small government and privatisation. In fact, economic historians Robert Allen and Michael Lind have demonstrated that unfree markets and big-government designs typified not only the East Asian path to industrialisation, but also America's rise in the early 19th century. They argue that wealthier countries started preaching to poorer countries about the need for free trade - that is, to reduce tariffs designed to protect nascent industries - and the need to reduce government size - that is, allow foreigners to buy up vital sectors of the economy - only after they themselves had completed industrialisation on the back of very protectionist measures. Equally dangerous is the myth perpetuated in the West that China has grown so rapidly because it has embraced the neo-liberal model. This is patently false. China has succeeded, thus far, because it reformed on its own terms, picking and choosing elements of development models around East Asia - those of Japan, Singapore and Taiwan - and adapting them to its own context. The Chinese model is, in fact, intended as an antidote to Western neo-liberalism. So what should the West do to counter the rise of the illiberal Chinese model? It must demonstrate some candour about its own developmental path - in the past and in the future - before it preaches to the developing world. It must invest more in education and in improving infrastructure to avoid being overtaken and left behind by China. It must swallow its pride and accept that it can learn some lessons from China in terms of long-term economic planning and market intervention. Narrowing the inequality gap in the West is essential so the China model does not gain further credibility on the back of purely economic success. And it must truly acknowledge the fragility of democracy itself in order to realise what is at stake here. As Israeli historian Irad Malkin noted: "Democracy existed for about 200 years in the ancient world and has existed for about 200 years in the modern world, and other than that there has been no democracy in the whole of human history. Oligarchies have always existed."
Immigrants with advanced degrees from US universities who work in STEM fields dramatically boost employment for US natives. During 2000– 2007, a 10 percent increase in the share of such workers boosted the US-born employment rate by 0.04 percent. Evaluating this at the average numbers of foreign- and US-born workers during that period, this implies that every additional 100 foreign-born workers who earned an advanced degree in the United States and then worked in STEM fields led to an additional 262 jobs for US natives. (See Table 2)

The election of Donald Trump has economic forecasters thinking hard about something that hasn't been a problem for a while: upside risk.
That is what we did. But it was difficult not to hear uncanny echoes of an age-old rhetoric of modernity, liberty, and liberation in government declarations during those days; difficult, too, not to see that that rhetoric would be supplemented by policies in plain disregard of the enlightened principles that were supposedly being defended. Extraordinary renditions had not yet become official policy, the category of enemy combatant not yet resignified to sidestep the Geneva Convention, but I remember a feeling of foreboding that cast a long shadow over the proceedings of the colloquium. There was a catastrophe unfolding in front of our eyes, and the discussion of Western historiographic discourses and their shortcomings seemed ultimately inadequate.
This pressure is coming as White House officials have tried to distance themselves from the policy. Trump blames Democrats falsely for the situation. The administration put the policy in place and could easily end it after it has led to a spike in cases of split and distraught families. "Nobody likes" breaking up families and "seeing babies ripped from their mothers' arms," said presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway. Nearly 2,000 children were separated from their families over a six-week period in April and May after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new "zero-tolerance" policy that refers all cases of illegal entry for criminal prosecution. U.S. protocol prohibits detaining children with their parents because the children are not charged with a crime and the parents are. Trump plans to meet with House Republicans on Tuesday to discuss pending immigration legislation amid an election-season debate over one of his favorite issues. The House is expected to vote this week on a bill pushed by conservatives that may not have enough support to pass, and a compromise measure with key proposals supported by the president. The White House has said Trump would sign either of those. Conway rejected the idea that Trump was using the kids as leverage to force Democrats to negotiate on immigration and his long-promised border wall, even after Trump tweeted Saturday: "Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change!" Asked whether the president was willing to end the policy, she said: "The president is ready to get meaningful immigration reform across the board." To Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the administration is "using the grief, the tears, the pain of these kids as mortar to build our wall. And it's an effort to extort a bill to their liking in the Congress." Schiff said the practice was "deeply unethical" and that Republicans' refusal to criticize Trump represented a "sad degeneration" of the GOP, which he said had become "the party of lies." "There are other ways to negotiate between Republicans and Democrats. Using children, young children, as political foils is abhorrent," said Sen Jack Reed, D-R.I. Even first lady Melania Trump, who has tended to stay out of contentious policy debates, waded into the emotional issue. Her spokeswoman says that Mrs. Trump believes "we need to be a country that follows all laws," but also one "that governs with heart." "Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform," spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said. The House proposals face broad opposition from Democrats, and even if a bill does pass, the closely divided Senate seems unlikely to go along. Trump's former chief strategist said Republicans would face steep consequences for pushing the compromise bill because it provides a path to citizenship for young "Dreamer" immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. Steve Bannon argued that effort risked alienating Trump's political base and contributing to election losses in November, when Republicans hope to preserve their congressional majorities. Conway and Schiff appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press," Collins was on CBS' "Face the Nation," Lujan and Bannon spoke on ABC's "This Week," and Scaramucci was on Fox 11 in Los Angeles.
If an immigration bill in the Senate eventually becomes law, there will certainly be a lot of people looking to take credit -- or dole out blame, depending on your perspective. You can put President Obama and Republican Sens. Marco Rubio (Florida) and Ted Cruz (Texas) at the top of that list. Here's why: 1. The Backroom Dealer President Obama supports the immigration reform bill in the Senate but he's largely let the group of Democrats and Republicans that wrote the legislation stand in the spotlight. Behind the scenes, however, he's been working to influence the process, according to a New Yorker article by Ryan Lizza (quoted here). The article cites a senior Obama administration official: "No decisions are being made without talking to us about it," the official said. "This does not fly if we're not O.K. with it." That Obama wants to guide the bill isn't shocking. What's more interesting is that the administration is now advertising its involvement in the dealmaking. It leaves the impression that the president wants credit for this bill when it's signed into law.
Is Donald Trump looking for an option to go to war against North Korea? That’s the unsettling conclusion from a report last week in The New York Times – that even Trump’s own generals and national security advisers, who are not exactly doves themselves, are afraid of giving the president any ideas. The Pentagon, “worried that the White House is moving too hastily toward military action on the Korean peninsula,” is resisting demands from Trump to explain how he might do precisely that, and so U.S. officials have consequently circumscribed how much they’re willing to tell the president. “Giving the president too many options,” the officials said, “could increase the odds that he will act,” reports the Times. For months, White House officials, including Gen. H.R. McMaster, who heads Trump’s National Security Council, have been making worrisome threats about taking out North Korea’s arsenal. In December, McMaster said that the likelihood of war with North Korea is “increasing every day.” There are widespread reports now that people within the Trump administration are considering giving North Korea a “bloody nose,” using a limited lightning strike. And hawks such as Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham declared that chances are at least 70 percent that the United States will launch all-out war with North Korea if there’s one more nuclear test. “If you ever use the military option, it’s not to just neutralize their nuclear facilities – you gotta be willing to take the regime completely down,” said Graham, adding that the idea “comes up all the time” when he plays golf with Trump The Pentagon, and most professional military men, don’t support the idea of a surgical strike against North Korea, and opposition to the idea from Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is particularly strong, says Daniel Sneider, a veteran Asia analyst and a visiting scholar at the Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University. “McMaster doesn’t really know much about this part of the world, and he’s trapped within the framework of the White House, taking Trump’s wandering thoughts and trying to put them in some sort of policy framework,” he tells Rolling Stone. But the terrifying scenarios came into sharper focus last week when Victor Cha, an Asia strategist and professor at Georgetown University, suddenly found that his appointment to serve as U.S. ambassador to South Korea was withdrawn. The withdrawal – weeks after he’d been vetted and after he’d been approved by the South Korean government – came after Cha told the White House and the NSC that he thought the idea of a bloody-nose, limited strike on Pyongyang was a terrible idea. Following the cancellation of his appointment, in a courageous op-ed in the Washington Post, Cha outlined his belief that even a modest attack would “escalat[e] into a war that would likely kill tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Americans.” Yet, said Cha, that’s exactly what’s being considered by Trump administration officials. Donald Trump’s current thinking on North Korea goes something like this: Because the North Korean leader, Kim Jung-un, is irrational, the traditional policy of nuclear deterrence – modeled on the Cold War standoff with the Soviet Union – won’t work with him. Kim, the White House argues, is so unreliable that he’s likely to lash out, possibly striking the United States or American targets, if and when his fast-developing nuclear arsenal is ready, even if such an attack would be suicidal. Therefore, some inside the Trump administration (and, it appears, the president himself) believe that a preemptive military strike aimed at hitting North Korea’s nuclear installations is a viable, even unavoidable, action. Doing so, goes the argument, will neutralize Kim’s nuclear arms, teach him a lesson and force him to come meekly to the bargaining table. But here’s the problem. If, as they believe, Kim is aggressive-minded and irrational, then who’s to say he won’t respond to even a limited attack by the United States with all-out war, striking military targets and South Korean civilian population centers, U.S. facilities and bases, and Japanese cities? Cha himself highlighted exactly this paradox in his op-ed. “If we believe that Kim is undeterrable without such a strike, how can we also believe that a strike will deter him from responding in kind?” he wrote. “And if Kim is unpredictable, impulsive and bordering on irrational, how can we control the escalation ladder, which is premised on an adversary’s rational understanding of signals and deterrence?” Little of that appears to register with the White House. Trump singled out North Korea in his State of the Union speech last week, seeming to blame the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations for not being tough with Pyongyang. “North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland,” Trump said. “Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.” By referring to “the mistakes of past administrations,” Trump means the record of diplomatic engagements with North Korea since the 1990s. None of that diplomacy ultimately dissuaded North Korea from expanding its nuclear-weapons program and its ballistic-missile development. Yet, a war on the Korean Peninsula would end up being so catastrophic – with as many as 300,000 killed even without the use of nuclear weapons by either side – that the vast majority of experts familiar with Korea believe that diplomacy is the only plausible option. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the beleaguered and put-upon chief diplomat for Trump, is one who apparently agrees with the proposition that diplomacy can still work. But since last fall Trump has repeatedly shot down Tillerson when it comes to diplomatic talks with North Korea. In October, when Tillerson opened the door on negotiations, Trump tweeted that his own secretary of state was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.” In December, when Tillerson declared that the United States was “ready to talk anytime North Korea would like to talk,” the White House contradicted him again. Since then, there have been persistent rumors that Tillerson could be replaced by a more hawkish successor. One party decidedly unnerved by Trump’s saber-rattling is America’s ostensible partner, South Korea, whose leader, President Moon Jae-in, is determined to seek détente with Kim Jung-un. Since taking office last May, Moon, who represents a progressive coalition in South Korean politics, has made no secret of his desire to seek an understanding with the North and to return to the “sunshine” era of North-South dialogue. “The Moon administration, and South Korean progressives generally, have a very clear set of views about the South’s relationship with the United States and with North Korea,” says Sneider, the Stanford-based analyst. “They think that the only way forward is an agreement between North Korea and South Korea, and they believe that it’s failed so far because of hardline policies from the United States.” By carefully balancing his ties to the United States with his policy of seeking talks with North Korea, Moon has managed a breakthrough of sorts. Following Kim’s New Year speech, in which he suggested his country’s participation in the Winter Olympics, Moon responded positively. And with North Korean officials slated to accompany their athletes to the games, it’s not impossible that the two Koreas could open the door a crack toward a North-South truce. But Moon can’t afford to stray too far from his American allies, and Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Japan and South Korea this week to make sure that doesn’t happen and that North Korea remains isolated. Pence, who’s reportedly bringing along the father of an American who died after being imprisoned in North Korea, isn’t likely to endorse the North-South dialogue, instead opting to raise tensions further. And without high-level U.S. support, South Korea’s diplomatic efforts will get only so far. So where can diplomacy go, if Tillerson is able to convince the White House to participate in talks that would include the two Koreas, Japan, China and Russia? A first step could be a freeze-for-freeze plan, already backed by Beijing and Moscow, in which North Korea would freeze its nuclear-weapons and missile-testing program in exchange for a freeze on U.S. and South Korean military exercises. Further down the road – though it might take many years – could be an accord that would have all sides agree to denuclearize the entire Korean Peninsula. For now, however – at least as far as the White House is concerned – it’s war, not peace, that seem to be on the horizon. “I’m extremely worried – not just based on what I’m hearing out of the White House but also what I’m hearing out of the defense community,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, last month. “We are far closer to actual conflict over North Korea than the American people realize.”
The previous section of the analysis focused on what was the securitization of cyberspace, how it is created and a brief analysis of the history which included some of the key reports to the government of the United States. Continuous reference was made to the securitization model; parts of this will be further analyzed with this second part of the question. This section of the analysis will deal with the problems and benefits of securitization; first the problems will be evaluated followed by the benefits. At the end of the section, it will be clear why the costs outweigh the benefits but how securitization is necessary. In analyzing the problems of the securitization of cyberspace, the concept of threat inflation, the shift towards censorship and surveillance, the militarization of cyberspace, and the problem with military industrial complexes will be evaluated. Threat inflation is a concept in political science whereby elites will create concern for a threat which goes way beyond what is required, “When a threat is inflated, the marketplace of ideas on which a democracy relies to make sound judgments in particular, the media and popular debate can become overwhelmed by fallacious information (Brito & Watkins, 2011, p. 2) In the article by Brito & Watkins parallels are made between the threat inflation of the cyber debate and the Iraq war. The Bush administration sought popular support for war by providing information that was later proved completely baseless. Implying that the Iraqi regime was connected to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and implying that the United States was threatened by weapons of mass destruction were untrue statements that convinced the audience. Brito and Watkins claim that from 2009 there has been pressure for increased federal involvement in cyber security, increased coverage by the media and the introduction of several bills in Congress are evidence of this action. However, many critics including Brito and Watkins claim the official consensus about a grave and immediate threat is unverifiable, “There is very little verifiable to substantiate the threats claimed, and the most vocal proponents of a threat engage in rhetoric that can only be characterized as alarmist (Brito & Watkins, 2011, p. 7) Censorship and surveillance has increased greatly in recent years, many forms of surveillance are now common practice across many states. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, countries have drafted bills which have included different surveillance- related proposals, these Bills contained a host of proposals designed to address future terrorist threats through changes to policing, the military and public administration (Haggery & Ericson, 2000, p. 175) Cyber-war has been used to describe many different actions, from attacking critical infrastructure to defacing websites. The shift towards censorship, surveillance and the securitization of cyberspace is very well connected, “Internet filtering is increasingly accepted worldwide, companies have imposed heavy-handed copyright controls, and surveillance in both the public and private sectors is widespread (Deibert, Militarizing Cyberspace, 2012) Because most conflict which takes place today involves a cyberspace component, any measures taken to control this environment have side-effects such as increased surveillance and censorship. In an effort to combat piracy in cyberspace there is a rise in tethered appliances, this where an appliance can only be modified by the manufacturer and provides innovations in a controlled form. Tethered appliance shave the potential to be used as great sources of surveillance and control, “Apple doesn't monitor emails sent over your iPhone, but could; TiVo, the television-recording device, routinely inform headquarters of what you've been watching (Burkeman, 2008).” Securitization of cyberspace is a threat to the modern liberal democracy, any major change to the control of the internet away from the laissez-faire approach would be particularly damaging. The militarization of cyberspace refers to building towards an offensive capability in cyberspace; the difference between the term securitization has already been made in the introduction. Due to the sophistication and highly reported cases of cyber-attack it is increasingly a strategic-military concern for states, many of whom want to acquire cyber weapons. The danger of focusing on the strategic-military aspect of cyber-attacks is subjecting it to zero-sum rules, whereby one state’s gain is another state’s loss. In an article by Cavelty on the militarization of Cyberspace it is stated that concentrating on the danger of cyber-attacks is unnecessary and creates insecurity in the international system, “This invokes enemy images even though there is no identifiable enemy, centers too strongly on national security measures instead of economic and business solutions, and wrong suggests that states can establish control over cyberspace (Cavelty, Cyber-Terror – Looming Threat or Phantom Menace? The Framing of the US Cyber-Threat Debate, 2007, p. 141).” Cavelty argues that there are major misperceptions about cyber-attacks, and that over representing the threat will cause unnecessary costs. Fears about an electronic Pearl Harbor have further prioritized cyberspace as a major issue of national security, “Although invoking fears of an electronic Pearl Harbor may be overheated rhetoric, an arms race in cyberspace creates an environment in which crime, espionage, malware, denial of service, filtering, and surveillance prosper and thrive (Deibert, Militarizing Cyberspace, 2012) .” The militarization has caused a conflict within cyberspace, which threatens to undermine the entire design through filtering, surveillance and control. The final major problem with the securitization of cyberspace is the build-up of the military industrial complex. Since WWII, there has been a military-industrial complex that encourages extravagant defense spending placing industry interests before the public interest. The securitization of cyberspace may be encouraging the creation of a cyber-industrial complex. Prominent Senators Rockefeller and Snowe in the United States have warned of the potential catastrophe from cyber-attack. At a hearing in 2010 Senator Rockefeller gave a speech with clearly alarmist rhetoric, “a major cyber- attack could shut down our nation’s most critical infrastructure: our power grid, telecommunications, financial services; you just think of it, and they can do it (Brito & Watkins, 2011, p. 18).” Defense industries in the cyber -security sector have a special interest in increased spending or regulation for cyberspace. Politicians and government officials have also noticed increased cyber security spending, for many it was seen as an opportunity to bring increased funding into their districts. “It was estimated that Cyber Command headquarters would bring at least 10,000 direct and ancillary jobs, billions of dollars in contracts, and millions in local spending (Brito & Watkins, 2011, p. 27).” Even the construction of a base meant that communities in 18 states were offering land, tax breaks and infrastructure; all the states who failed to gain the headquarters wasted a great amount of tax-payers money
In October 1949, following the Chinese civil war of the 1930s and 1940s, Mao Zedong established the People’s Republic of China. Mao’s communists had defeated the Nationalists, or Kuomintang (KMT), of Chiang Kai-shek who had long been supported by the United States. Following the communist victory Washington rejected formal relations with Beijing and maintained diplomacy with the Nationalists who retreated to Taiwan. In February 1950 Beijing and Moscow signed the SinoSoviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Later that year Chinese troops began fighting in the Korean War against the United States in alliance with the Soviet-backed North. For decades China had been perceived as an ally and Chinese and Americans had fought together in the Second World War. Now, the country was reconstructed as a danger to the United States. ‘Red’ China was a threat in the sense that American troops were being killed in Korea. Nonetheless, the course of Sino-US relations during the early 1950s, and the response by the United States to a new and seemingly imminent China ‘threat’, is once more unexplainable without attention to the centrality of American identity. The outbreak of the Korean War led President Harry Truman on 27 June 1950 to order the American Seventh Fleet to China to deter an invasion of Taiwan. Yet, at this time the PRC was still to enter the war or become involved in hostilities with the United States. China’s capabilities were also broadly unchanged and until the late 1940s it was argued that they could not threaten American security in the short to medium term. In 1948 for example the Department of State’s Policy Planning Staff asserted that ‘in any war in the foreseeable future China could at best be [considered] . . . an inconsequential enemy’.66 This view was reinforced in February 1949 by National Security Council report (NSC) 41 which declared that China was unlikely to threaten the US ‘within the next generation or more’.67 The American press had also responded to the establishment of the PRC in a predominantly measured tone.68 From the early 1950s then China became a ‘threat’ for reasons other than its physical and behavioural attributes. Just like in the mid-to-late nineteenth century ‘dangers’ from China were not objectively observed. They relied upon processes of interpretation and representation and were again central to prescribing the limits of political potentiality in Washington. The US intervention in defence of Taiwan in June 1950 has been predominantly (although not exclusively) analysed in terms of military and strategic considerations.69 The questions posed have generally been ‘why’ questions; why did the United States choose to defend an island now threatened by Chinese aggression? The question which remains is how the defence of Taiwan was actually made possible. Even before its defeat to the communists Chiang’s Nationalist government was perceived as ‘undemocratic, corrupt and incompetent’.70 Wider concerns were raised that his regime was violent and dictatorial. In October 1949 Secretary of State Dean Acheson argued that the United States should not support Taiwan’s ‘discredited, decayed KMT government’. As such, the island did not constitute a priority to American security.71 How then was it possible for Washington to mobilise support for Taiwan so soon after its government had been dismissed as corrupt and dictatorial, against an ‘enemy’ so recently identified as impotent?72 On 23 June – just four days before the Seventh Fleet arrived in the region – Acheson reaffirmed Washington’s intention to abstain from military involvement there.73 As always, societal representations gave China’s (and the United States’) material forces meaning and expose how US policies of the time could be enacted towards a socially constructed rather than self evident China threat. Furthermore, their exploration once again demonstrates the continuing function of those policies in the reaffirmation and protection of American identity. When Truman announced his intention to protect Taiwan he argued that ‘[t]he attack upon Korea makes it plain beyond all doubt that communism has passed beyond the use of subversion to conquer independent nations’. Communist forces, he asserted, now represented a direct threat to American security.74 Truman had emphasised the criticality of shielding the United States from communism but communism itself does not constitute a threat. It requires the understanding that it represents a threat by contradicting the values of non-communist states.75 Certainly, Taiwan was a key component in the struggle for East Asian influence by allowing an American presence less than two hundred kilometres from China. However, the Truman administration did not consider formal alliances with every regime threatened by a powerful neighbour, particularly those it regarded as violent, undemocratic, and corrupt. American support for Taiwan not only required an appreciation of the strategic realities of the Cold War, but the understanding that it represented a noncommunist member of the imagined Free World and an extension of the values of American identity. Taiwan, like China, existed for American imaginations. To rephrase Fairbank, at any given time the truth about the island was in their heads.76 As ever, the material forces which ‘threatened’ the United States were not the external objects of circulating discourses about them. They were inextricable from, and constitutive of, those discourses. Observes Bruce Cumings: China, little known to most Americans . . . could become ‘China’, an issue that most people could be mobilized around because it stood for nothing in the American mind and therefore could stand for everything – it was a tabula rasa on which the right-wing and the expansionists could write.77 China’s capacity to become a threat had not increased since so recently being dismissed, but power/knowledge now made China threatening to American security. This is illustrated by the Truman administration’s 1947 Executive Order 9835 (the ‘Loyalty Order’). Any individual or group affiliated with communism, it declared, would be barred from employment by the federal government.78 Communist values were anathema to the functioning of the United States and as such had to be repelled. In the speech which came to constitute his so-called doctrine Truman pledged American support for ‘free people’ threatened by communists.79 Labelling communist dangers ‘outside pressures’ it was an act of foreign policy designed to protect American identity.80 The same can be said of NSC 68.81 Written in 1950 this provided the blueprint for America’s Cold War response to communism.82 Numerable governmental statements of the time were based upon its rhetoric and it drew inspiration from the Declaration of Independence and American Constitution. In particular, it emphasised the need to ‘assure the integrity and vitality of our free society’.83 Thus, American representations of an imagined China threat adjusted the boundaries of possibility beyond intervention in the Taiwan Strait. After its entry into the Korean War for example the PRC was subjected to a trade embargo by Washington. Just as the Exclusion Act of 1882 had restricted and controlled the Chinese at home, Washington’s early Cold War containment policies were the inscription of discourses which separated ‘threatening’ China from the ‘true’ American population. It was not a ‘bridge’ between states or the final product of representation.84 The embargo was intended to slow China’s development but, like the Truman Doctrine and the Loyalty Order, served more fundamentally to designate it an international pariah.85 Washington’s policy reaffirmed China’s (communist) foreignness from the (democratic-capitalist) United States; as Truman explicitly observed, the aim was to restrict trade ‘between the free world and the Soviet Union and its Satellites’.86 Discourses of ideology had largely replaced those of race in the protection of what it was but the US was still imagined as a ‘fully made’ society vulnerable to ‘civilisational decomposition’.87 Once again, acts of US policy themselves were designed to prevent the erosion of American identity, as additionally illustrated by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 which moved from a focus on racial or national origins to affiliation with communism as a barrier to entry to the United States.88 During the nineteenth-century hysteria over immigration from China the Chinese had been identified as a danger to white America. By the 1950s representations of a China threat had adapted to new circumstances but it remained fantasised and socially constructed. Once more understandings of the ‘threat’ were challenged, for instance by writers like Agnes Smedley and Edgar Snow. Smedley’s Battle Hymn of China recounted time spent in the company of the Chinese communists and was deeply sympathetic towards Mao and his followers.89 Snow’s Red Star Over China, among his other works, was also notable for advancing resistance discourses of a more civilised, less antagonistic PRC.90 By 1966 Red Star alone had sold 65,000 copies in the United States.91 However, societal rules of discursive exclusion marginalised ideas which competed with those of Robert Rigg, for example, who argued that ‘[n]o fat and sadistic warlords of China’s history will ever be able to compete with the grisly record of the militaristic Chinese communists’.92 Chinese authors like Shaw-tong Liu further emphasised China’s foreign, communist identity. ‘Red China’s rulers are the new partners of the dictators of Russia . . . I am one of those few fortunate fish who escaped through the net’, he explained.93 In addition, of course, the communist ‘threat’ was promoted by Senator Joseph McCarthy who engineered an unparalleled fear of communism and helped secure the discursive hegemony of a ‘threatening’ Red China.94 In cases like this representations of China were explicitly advanced as propaganda. They were functional, with a clear purpose to demonise the PRC and present as unequivocal the dangers it was understood to pose. The boundaries between governmental Cold War McCarthyesque propaganda and (‘lower level’) societal discourses, however, were regularly blurred as representations of a China threat once more worked primarily for those who benefitted most from its existence within American imaginations. Put differently, while some were perhaps more directive and overtly instrumental than others, to some degree American representations of a China threat were each intended to present a common reality. As in the late nineteenth century – consciously or otherwise – they were purposeful and useful, with the power to frame parameters of behaviour in Washington. They were again produced by those who attributed most significance to particular understandings about the United States; in this case its commitments to personal liberty, democracy, and free markets. The material realities of the Korean War in particular were not inconsequential, but articulations of the need to secure Americans from Truman’s ‘outside pressures’ introduced new avenues of behaviour. As Bostdorff explains: ‘Korea marked a turning point in the application of American foreign policy but the Truman Doctrine was the symbolic turning point which made that transformation possible.’95 As it had done more than half a century earlier American identity entered a period of crisis. Exaggerated claims of a China threat were again responsible as the existing order was considered increasingly endangered.96 This developing crisis once more worked in tandem with the discourses which distanced China from the United States, reinforcing the construction of the threat as rhetoric intensified over how to restore order. As before, the purpose of this latest crisis was to facilitate particular avenues of US policy. Only this way can it be revealed how the United States could legitimately defend a regime on Taiwan dismissed as unfit to govern, while containing and marginalising a land and people so recently declared unthreatening. Once more, powerful discourses had been advanced to enable particular policies towards a constructed China threat. The Truman Doctrine in particular confirmed understandings of American identity and made it unthinkable that communism could succeed where capitalism and democracy might fail. As ever, China was what American discourses allowed it to be. Most importantly, those discourses continued to frame the boundaries of Washington’s approach towards a China ‘threat’ which existed primarily within and for American imaginations.
To encapsulate, the biopolitics of debilitation is an analytic that allows us to see the assemblage relations of disability, debility, and capacity, noting that Euro-American rights frames, often centralizing individuals extracted from populations, operates through forms of capacitation in relation to that which it must sublimate: the material conditions of deliberate population debilitation. This assemblage thus not only deindividualizes disability, a move that many disability scholars have pushed for. It also shifts from positing disability as a collective experience (of aging, of inevitable frailty and illness) to nuancing that observation through attention to populations and their differential and uneven precarity. Rethinking disability through the precarity of populations not only acknowledges that there is more disability within disenfranchised and precarious populations, but also insists that debilitation is a tactical practice deployed in order to create and precaritize populations and maintain them as such. The biopolitics of debilitation thus situates disability within formulations of risk, calculation, prognosis, and statistical probability, whereby disability is understood not as phenomenological essence, identity, or a personal attribute, but as risk coding, as an embedded aspect of biopolitical population management.28 Public health practitioners, for example, understand racism as a risk factor. Race is “a marker of risk for racism-related exposures. Race is useful in that it enables the identification of persons at risk for exposures that vary by racial category (e.g., discrimination).”29 Thus the biopolitics of debilitation informs the biopolitics of disability with the understanding that the frame of inclusion and exclusion is already infused with economies of risk. Such frames are therefore foundational to the regulation of the categories of disability and ability that delimit an acknowledgment of debilitation as a distribution of risk. Debility is thus understood as a process rather than an identity or attribute, a verb and a doing rather than a happening or happening to or done to. It complicates the notion of a workplace injury or accident by understanding the statistical likelihood by which certain populations are expected to yield themselves to bodily debilitation, deterioration, and outright harm. Relevant considerations that Meekosha centralizes in a southern theory of disability bracket momentarily the adherence to the binary production of the non-disabled versus the disabled body, so often used to determine and evaluate who is “actually disabled.” Addressed immediately is the social justice question of what is access to health? What does it mean to have access to health, or to access health, and to access health care? This formulation centralizes the connections between poverty, debt, and disability.30 Poverty itself may well be thought of as a form of debilitation; debt and austerity are increasingly linked to the collapse of health care systems and the inability to access medical care. Tropes of disability are used to describe the past as well as the future of capitalism, such that debt functions as debility. The concept of “crippling debt,” for example, reveals the ways in which fiscal “health” is a form of capacitation or capacity. Theorizing debt as bodily vulnerability recognizes the historical and structural relationships between poverty and disability—engendered by colonization, occupation, environmental degradation, war, biomedicine, and labor exploitation. It also highlights that disability can be negotiated through access to medical care only for the very few. More important, within the context of the financial expropriation endemic to the lack of socialized health care in the United States, and given the high rates of bankruptcy due to medical bills, theorizing debt as debility entails mapping out a system of profit for capital that mines and multiplies debilitated bodies. If one is against the neoliberal normativizing and micromanaging of health as a forever impossible ideal to reach, if one is indeed “against health,” to use a framing from Jonathan Metzl and Anna Kirkland, how are populations who have little access to health situated in this formulation?31 The social model of disability, elaborated at length, states that it is not the body that is impaired but the social that maintains ableist structures. Warfare, exploitative laboring conditions, occupations, incarceration count as a large component of these structures, part of an inaccessible ableist social, as much as buildings, curbs, ramps, elevators, service animals, cognitive normativity, and chemical sensitivities. When one asks, “Is it accessible?” the social model asks, “Accessible to what? What does an accessible health care infrastructure look like, and for whom?” Maintaining a construction of the social that revolves around built infrastructure and obstacles to them, rather than a social that includes work and warring as debilitating processes, is a function of racial, class, and locational privilege. Is a young black man without a diagnosed disability living in the United States who is statistically much more likely than most to be imprisoned, shot at by police, or killed by the time of adulthood actually a referent for what it means to be able-bodied? 32 What I am arguing would not diminish the specificity of disabled embodiment, nor necessarily expand what the term “disability” encompasses. Rather, this approach connects disability to those who are debilitated, to those whose bodily experiences challenge a disaggregation of an us/them binary in terms of who is seen as able-bodied, and acknowledges the now-regulatory functions of the category of disability.
But in reality, of course, the two procedures coexist. The US government agencies running the "war on terror" have become increasingly reliant on an extralegal practice known as "extraordinary rendition"--a euphemism for a policy of seizing suspicious individuals at home or abroad without even the semblance of due process and sending them off to be interrogated by allied regimes known to practice torture. Not all of the "enhanced" interrogations are farmed out to foreign intelligence services, however: Witness the CIA's "black sites," located abroad but covertly operated by the US government. Presumably, "high-value" detainees are whisked away to these undisclosed locations when no foreign proxy can be entrusted to do the job right. So what about the "realistic" counterargument to this policy of clandestine torture? The war on terror is dirty, the realists begin by admitting. At times the lives of thousands depend on information we may be able to extract from our prisoners. So what do you think the government is going to do? And if we're going to do it--with great reluctance, of course--then shouldn't we have checks on the way we do it, to prevent excesses? As Alan Dershowitz put it, "I'm not in favor of torture, but if you're going to have it, it should damn well have court approval." This logic is, of course, extremely dangerous: It legitimizes torture and thus opens up the space for more illicit torture. So we must reject the liberal "honesty" of a Dershowitz, but are we now stuck supporting a paradoxical and hypocritical policy of publicly condemning torture while privately practicing it? In a singular situation, confronted with the proverbial "prisoner who knows" and whose words might save thousands, one would unquestionably turn to torture as a last resort; however, it is absolutely crucial that one not elevate this desperate choice into a universal principle. Rather, in the unavoidable, brutal urgency of the moment, one should simply do it. Only by rejecting in principle the notion that torture is permissible even in dire circumstances (while knowing that we resorted to it in precisely such circumstances) can we retain the requisite sense of guilt and awareness of the inadmissibility of what we did.
Reducing distrust over Taiwan: Both sides want to work toward a peaceful resolution of existing differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan are viewed in Washington and Taipei as a necessary ingredient for sustaining the confidence of U.S. support in Taipei necessary for Taipei to continue to develop wide ranging cross-Strait relations. Those same sales in Beijing are viewed  as confirming American arrogance and determination to interfere in China’s domestic affairs and to prevent peaceful unification from occurring, thereby harming a clearly-articulated Chinese core interest. Washington and Beijing should engage in serious discussion of the overall security situation surrounding the Taiwan Strait. Lack of such discussion has contributed to having each side make worst case assumptions in their acquisition and deployment of military resources, enhancing mutual distrust and ultimately potentially reducing the chances of maintaining the peace in the Taiwan Strait that both sides desire.
There is a real—but largely concealed—war which is taking place throughout the African continent. It involves the United States, an invigorated Russia and a rising China. The outcome of the war is likely to define the future of the continent and its global outlook. It is easy to pin the blame on US President Donald Trump, his erratic agenda and impulsive statements. But the truth is the current US military expansion in Africa is just another step in the wrong direction. It is part of a strategy that had been implemented a decade ago, during the administration of President George W. Bush, and actively pursued by President Barack Obama. In 2007, under the pretext of the ‘war on terror’, the US consolidated its various military operations in Africa to establish the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM). With a starting budget of half a billion dollars, AFRICOM was supposedly launched to engage with African countries in terms of diplomacy and aid. But, over the course of the last 10 years, AFRICOM has been transformed into a central command for military incursions and interventions. However, that violent role has rapidly worsened during the first year of Trump’s term in office. Indeed, there is a hidden US war in Africa, and it is fought in the name of ‘counter-terrorism’. According to a VICE News special investigation, US troops are now conducting 3,500 exercises and military engagements throughout Africa per year, an average of 10 per day. US mainstream media rarely discusses this ongoing war, thus giving the military ample space to destabilize any of the continent’s 54 countries as it pleases. “Today’s figure of 3,500 marks an astounding 1,900 percent increase since the command was activated less than a decade ago, and suggests a major expansion of US military activities on the African continent,” VICE reported. Following the death of four US Special Forces soldiers in Niger on October 4, US Secretary of Defense James Mattis made an ominous declaration to a Senate committee: these numbers are likely to increase as the US is expanding its military activities in Africa. Mattis, like other defense officials in the previous two administrations, justifies the US military transgressions as part of ongoing ‘counter-terrorism’ efforts. But such coded reference has served as a pretense for the US to intervene in, and exploit, a massive region with a great economic potential. The old colonial ‘Scramble for Africa’ is being reinvented by global powers that fully fathom the extent of the untapped economic largesse of the continent. While China, India and Russia are each developing a unique approach to wooing Africa, the US is invested mostly in the military option, which promises to inflict untold harm and destabilize many nations. The 2012 coup in Mali, carried out by a US-trained army captain, Amadou Haya Sanogo, is only one example. In a 2013 speech, then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cautioned against a “new colonialism in Africa (in which it is) easy to come in, take out natural resources, pay off leaders and leave.” While Clinton is, of course, correct, she was disingenuously referring to China, not her own country. China’s increasing influence in Africa is obvious, and Beijing’s practices can be unfair. However, China’s policy towards Africa is far more civil and trade-focused than the military-centered US approach. The growth in the China-Africa trade figures are, as per a UN News report in 2013, happening at a truly “breathtaking pace”, as they jumped from around $10.5 billion per year in 2000 to $166 billion in 2011. Since then, it has continued at the same impressive pace. But that growth was coupled with many initiatives, entailing many billions of dollars in Chinese credit to African countries to develop badly needed infrastructure. More went to finance the ‘African Talents Program’, which is designed to train 30,000 African professionals in various sectors. It should come as no surprise, then, that China surpassed the US as Africa’s largest trading partner in 2009. The real colonialism, which Clinton referred to in her speech, is, however, under way in the US’s own perception and behavior towards Africa. This is not a hyperbole, but in fact a statement that echoes the words of US President Trump himself.
Obviously, much changed on September 11. But not everything changed. The United States still needs friends in the world - now more than ever. One of the most important but least appreciated successes of American foreign policy has been the reservoir of goodwill toward our country that we have created by educating successive generations of world leaders. As the debate on foreign students proceeds, we must recognize that our country gains much from being their destination of choice. It also remains true that 99.99 percent of the foreign students enrolled in our institutions wish us no ill, cause us no problems, and seek nothing more than the best education in the world. As the administration seeks to define an effective anti-terrorism strategy, we cannot afford to punish the many for the acts of the few. September 11 did not change the fact that U.S. pre-eminence in science is not an accident; it is due fundamentally to our openness to scientific exchange, which has enabled us over the generations to benefit from the best scientific expertise in the world. It is very much worth preserving the freedom of foreign scholars to participate in scientific exchanges at U.S. universities and research institutes. America's world leadership is being tested as rarely before. But how will we continue to renew our ability to lead? Another thing September 11 did not change is that we cannot effectively lead a world we do not understand. Foreign scholars who help us understand the world from whence they come do not threaten our national security; they enhance it. If cracking down on foreign students and scholars could really protect us against terrorism, it might be necessary to forego the benefits that they bring. But that's not the case. Foreign students and scholars constitute a tiny proportion of the 30 million foreign visitors who enter the United States annually with visas, and a minuscule proportion of the hundreds of millions who cross our borders legally each year. Whatever degree of monitoring of foreign visitors may be necessary, we cannot pretend that we protect ourselves by applying it only to this small group. Monitoring systems will never reveal people's intentions. There is no substitute for the intelligence community being able to identify dangerous people before they get here. Absent that, we will always be blind. The threat we face is very serious. Our nation's response must be equally so. Daunting foreign policy, military, intelligence, and security challenges confront us. The job now is to focus the nation's attention and resources on these urgent challenges. Given that foreign students are already among the most closely monitored of all nonimmigrant visitors, it is difficult not to see increased monitoring as a diversion from the task at hand.
Students shy away from STEM majors for many reasons. One is a lack of math proficiency when entering college. Only 46 percent of students who take the ACT entrance examination for college achieve the ACT College Readiness Benchmark in math. 19 Higher education spends at least $2 billion per year to compensate for weaknesses in students’ secondary education.20 A recent study found that one reason for high diversion out of STEM majors in college was that students did not succeed as well in these majors as they expected and then switched to a major for which they felt better equipped.21 Finally, many students who transfer out of STEM majors may be performing well, but they find the introductory STEM classes uninteresting. 22 Although in 2010 a higher percentage of students intended to pursue science and engineering majors than in 1995, some STEM subjects have seen a decrease in students. For instance, the percentage of freshmen intending to study computer science dropped to 1.5 percent in 2010 from 5.2 percent in 2000.23 Once a student has embarked on a non-STEM major it can be difficult to switch to a STEM major. STEM majors often require more classes than non-STEM majors and have additional prerequisites. As a result, juniors deciding they want to major in engineering, for example, may have more difficulty completing the requirements on time than juniors deciding they want to major in English. Only five percent of those who start in a non-STEM major graduate with a STEM degree. It is often hard for those who graduate with a non STEM degree to obtain the credentials necessary to work in a STEM field. STEM educational and career paths offer many opportunities to leave a STEM field, but fewer opportunities to enter or reenter those fields. Only six percent of those who work in a STEM career did not graduate with a STEM major.25 While some schools have implemented programs that allow non-engineers to obtain graduate degrees in engineering, such as Boston University’s Late Entry Accelerated Program, these opportunities are rare.
Nuclear policy experts can seem like Cassandra, constantly prophesizing apocalyptic futures. In case you haven't noticed, we don't live in a Mad Max world devastated by nuclear war. Terrorists have not blown up New York with a makeshift nuclear bomb. We haven't bankrupted ourselves, despite the trillions of dollars spent on Cold War weapons. ¶ Cassandra's curse, however, was not that she was wrong, but that no one believed her. I don't know a single nuclear expert who thinks that the threat of nuclear terrorism is shrinking. I don't know a single one who thinks that the actions taken by world leaders at this week's Nuclear Security Summit are enough. We are fearful. And you should be, too. ¶ Chills went down a lot of experts' spines last month when we saw the news that the Brussels bombers, the ISIS terrorists who blew up the airport and attacked the metro, were secretly videotaping a Belgian nuclear official. This official worked at a facility that had radiological material that terrorists could use for a "dirty bomb." We do not know if they were filming him or his family, if there was a kidnap plot in motion, or what their exact plans were. But this is not some Hollywood fantasy. This is real. A nuclear terrorist event may be closer than you think. ¶ What are the risks? First, that terrorists could steal a complete nuclear weapon, like SPECTRE in the James Bond thriller, "Thunderball." This is hard, but not impossible. The key risk is that the outside terrorists get insider help: For example, a radical jihadist working at a Pakistan weapon storage site. Or the Belgian base just outside Brussels where we still stash a half-dozen nuclear weapons left over from Cold War deployments. Or the Incirlik air base in Turkey where we keep an estimated 50 weapons just 200 miles from the Syrian border. ¶ Second, terrorists could steal the "stuff" of a bomb, highly enriched uranium or plutonium. They cannot make this themselves -- that requires huge, high-tech facilities that only nations can construct. But if they could get 50 or 100 pounds of uranium -- about the size of a bag of sugar -- they could construct a crude Hiroshima-style bomb. ISIS, with its money, territory and global networks, poses the greatest threat to do this that we have ever seen. Such a bomb brought by truck or ship or FedEx to an urban target could kill hundreds of thousands, destroy a city and put the world's economy and politics into shock. ¶ Third, there is the possibility of a dirty bomb. Frankly, many of us are surprised this has not happened already. I spoke to Jon Stewart on his show 15 years ago about the danger. This is not a nuclear explosion unleashed by splitting atoms, but simply a conventional explosive, like dynamite, laced with radioactive material, like cesium or strontium. A 10-pound satchel of dynamite mixed with less than 2 ounces of cesium (about the size of a pencil eraser) could spew a radioactive cloud over tens of square blocks. No one would die, unless they were right next to the explosion. But the material would stick to the buildings. Inhaling just a speck would greatly increase your risk of getting cancer. You could go into the buildings, but no one would. There would be mass panic and evacuations, and the bomb would render a port, financial district, or government complex unusable and uninhabitable for years until scrubbed clean. Economic losses could be in the trillions. ¶ Fourth, terrorists could just attack a nuclear power reactor, fuel storage or other site to trigger a massive radioactive release that could contaminate hundreds or thousands of square miles, like Chernobyl or Fukushima. While nuclear reactors are hardened against outside attack, including by the intentional crash of a medium-sized jet plane, larger planes could destroy them. Or a series of suicide truck bombers. But it might not even take a physical explosion. This week, it was reported the United States and the United Kingdom are to simulate a cyberattack on a nuclear power plant. ¶ Can we prevent these attacks? Yes, by eliminating, reducing and securing all supplies of nuclear materials so that terrorists would find it too difficult to get them. And by reducing and better protecting nuclear reactors and spent nuclear fuel. ¶ Are we doing enough? No. "The capabilities of some terrorist groups, particularly the Islamic State, have grown dramatically," says Harvard scholar and former Bush Administration official William Tobey, "In a net calculation, the risk of nuclear terrorism is higher than it was two years ago." ¶ The United States spends about $35 billion on nuclear weapons every year. This year, we will spend $1.8 billion on all our efforts to stop the spread these weapons and stop nuclear terrorism. You don't have to be a nuclear expert to know something is out of whack here. ¶ It is time we put our money where our threats are. ¶
These are all examples of what I will call “real utopias”. This may seem like a contradiction in terms. Utopias are fantasies, morally inspired designs for a humane world of peace and harmony unconstrained by realistic considerations of human psychology and social feasibility. Realists eschew such fantasies. What we need are hardnosed proposals for pragmatically improving our institutions. Instead of indulging in utopian dreams we must accommodate to practical realities. The idea of Real Utopias embraces this tension between dreams and practice. It is grounded in the belief that what is pragmatically possible is not fixed independently of our imaginations, but is itself shaped by our visions. Self-fulfilling prophecies are powerful forces in history, and while it may be naively optimistic to say “where there is a will there is a way”, it is certainly true that without “will” many “ways” become impossible. Nurturing clear-sighted understandings of what it would take to create social institutions free of oppression is part of creating a political will for radical social changes to reduce oppression. A vital belief in a utopian ideal may be necessary to motivate people to leave on the journey from the status quo in the first place, even though the likely actual destination may fall short of the utopian ideal. Yet, vague utopian fantasies may lead us astray, encouraging us to embark on trips that have no real destinations at all, or worse still, which lead us toward some unforeseen abyss. Along with “where there is a will there is a way”, the human struggle for emancipation confronts “the road to hell is paved with good intentions”. What we need, then, is “real utopias”: utopian ideals that are grounded in the real potentials of humanity, utopian destinations that have accessible waystations, utopian designs of institutions that can inform our practical tasks of navigating a world of imperfect conditions for social change. The idea that social institutions can be rationally transformed in ways that enhance human wellbeing and happiness has a long and controversial history. On the one hand, radicals of diverse stripes have argued that social arrangements inherited from the past are not immutable facts of nature, but transformable human creations. Social institutions can be designed in ways that eliminate forms of oppression that thwart human aspirations for fulfilling and meaningful lives. The central task of emancipatory politics is to create such institutions. On the other hand, conservatives have generally argued that grand designs for social reconstruction are nearly always disasters. While contemporary social institutions may be far from perfect, they are generally serviceable. At least, it is argued, they provide the minimal conditions for social order and stable interactions. These institutions have evolved through a process of slow, incremental modification as people adapt social rules and practices to changing circumstances. The process is driven by trial and error much more than by conscious design, and by and large those institutions which have endured have done so because they have enduring virtues. This does not preclude institutional change, even deliberate institutional change, but it means that such change should be very cautious and incremental and should not envision wholesale transformations of existing arrangements. At the heart of these alternative perspectives is a disagreement about the relationship between the intended and unintended consequences of deliberate efforts at social change. The conservative critique of radical projects is not mainly that the emancipatory goals of radicals are morally indefensible – although some conservatives criticize the underlying values of such projects as well – but that the uncontrollable, and usually negative, unintended consequences of these efforts at massive social change inevitably swamp the intended consequences. Radicals and revolutionaries suffer from what Frederick Hayek termed the “fatal conceit” – the mistaken belief that through rational calculation and political will, society can be designed in ways that will significantly improve the human condition.5 Incremental tinkering may not be inspiring, but it is the best we can do. Of course, one can point out that many reforms favored by conservatives also have massive, destructive unintended consequences. The havoc created in many poor countries by World Bank structural adjustment programs would be an example. And furthermore, under certain circumstances conservatives themselves argue for radical, society-wide projects of institutional design, as in the catastrophic “shock therapy” strategy for transforming the command economy of the Soviet Union into free-market capitalism in the 1990s. Nevertheless, there is a certain apparent plausibility to the general claim by conservatives that the bigger the scale and scope of conscious projects of social change, the less likely it is that we will be able to predict ahead of time all of the ramifications of those changes. Radicals on the left have generally rejected this vision of human possibility. Particularly in the Marxist tradition, radical intellectuals have insisted that wholesale redesign of social institutions is within the grasp of human beings. This does not mean, as Marx emphasized, that detailed institutional “blueprints” can be devised in advance of the opportunity to create an alternative. What can be worked out are the core organizing principles of alternatives to existing institutions, the principles that would guide the pragmatic trial-and-error task of institution-building. Of course, there will be unintended consequences of various sorts, but these can be dealt with as they arrive “after the revolution.” The crucial point is that unintended consequences need not pose a fatal threat to the emancipatory projects themselves. Regardless of which of these stances seems most plausible, the belief in the possibility of radical alternatives to existing institutions has played an important role in contemporary political life. It is likely that the political space for social democratic reforms was, at least in part, expanded because more radical ruptures with capitalism were seen as possible, and that possibility in turn depended crucially on many people believing that radical ruptures were workable. The belief in the viability of revolutionary socialism, especially when backed by the grand historical experiments in the USSR and elsewhere, enhanced the achievability of reformist social democracy as a form of class compromise. The political conditions for progressive tinkering with social arrangements, therefore, may depend in significant ways on the presence of more radical visions of possible transformations. This does not mean, of course, that false beliefs about what is possible are to be supported simply because they are thought to have desirable consequences, but it does suggest plausible visions of radical alternatives, with firm theoretical foundations, are an important condition for emancipatory social change. We now live in a world in which these radical visions are often mocked rather than taken seriously. Along with the post-modernist rejection of “grand narratives”, there is an ideological rejection of grand designs, even by many people still on the left of the political spectrum. This need not mean an abandonment of deeply egalitarian emancipatory values, but it does reflect a cynicism about the human capacity to realize those values on a substantial scale. This cynicism, in turn, weakens progressive political forces in general.
An anti-globalization wave has been blazing across Latin America. Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, whose headline-grabbing rhetoric only became fierier after his recent re-election, hasn't missed an opportunity to highlight the alleged evils of capitalism. Bolivian president Evo Morales has voiced a similar script, and so have a score of other presidential candidates in the region. Some have lost—Ollanta Humala in Peru and Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico—and others have somehow managed to come back from the shadows—Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. But despite the fiery rhetoric, often used to boost popularity among the poor, the economic realities of the region indicate that trade across borders remains both desirable and necessary. It is clear that Latin American economies are intertwined with foreign markets, and particularly the U.S. In 2005, for example, the U.S. received nearly 15 percent of Chilean exports. More conspicuously, the U.S. accounted for roughly 63 percent of Venezuela's total market abroad. Based on forecasts, some of the largest Latin American economies combined—Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela—are expected to attract foreign investments worth $47.5 billion this year, increasing investments by 11.5 percent in comparison with last year. There is a major gap between the political rhetoric of some leaders and the world they are forced to inhabit. Latin American economies have to live in the inescapable reality of an intertwined world in which economic and commercial relations are a given. Ignoring this reality will not bring about revolutions from thin air. It will simply hurt the country's performance and ultimately diminish the conditions for growing and generating wealth. Leaders in the region will have to make choices on whether to work with the realities of globalized economies or try to turn their backs on it. With the recent renewal of Andean trade preferences for only six months, it is crucial to think of long-term trade relations with the U.S—and other countries. Colombia and Peru have already been moving forward with free trade agreements. Those who remain in the anti-globalization bloc, however, may soon see their economies plummeting even further. The real question for Latin America isn't whether trade and open markets are good or even necessary. It is rather whether the dividends derived from trade will be available for the poor, who can only benefit if they gain access to the market. Former IMF expert Agustin Carstens believes that the economic challenges in Latin America are well known. Succinctly put, the region needs to "bring about greater reductions in poverty and inequality than have happened in the past." Nonetheless, combating poverty by attacking cross-border trade and investment itself is like fighting heart disease by campaigning against exercise. The script of rabid nationalism and anti-globalization hasn't been exhausted yet. But sooner or later reality will rear its head. Bolivia is currently in the midst of demonstrations, with the wealthiest provinces seeking greater autonomy from the central government, and oil windfalls are bound to decline at some point. After the rhetoric, massive public debts, escalating inflation, and bloated governments will likely lead to financial and social crises, which countries like Argentina have been through already. Those Latin American leaders who decide to ignore the inescapable dynamics of growth only do so at their own peril. And most unfortunately, at their country's as well.
Before explaining why lawmakers lacked the incentives to rein in the President, a bit of a recap. At the start of this essay, I quoted Justices Jackson and Ginsburg to make-what I consider-a fairly obvious point. Congress has the power to check the President. But if it does not use that power, the President has incentive to fill the void. That does not mean that the President can do whatever he wants. As was true in the war on terror cases, the Supreme Court can place some limits on presidential power. But without a Congress willing to assert its institutional prerogatives, defeats in court are not likely to stick to the President. Richard Nixon lost several significant cases in court.60 But that is not the reason the presidency was hampered after Nixon left office. The reason was tied to the Watergate-era Congress's willingness to assert itself through numerous legislative enactments and through beefed up oversight. Remember: Dick Cheney's complaint about an imperiled presidency had nothing to do with Supreme Court decision-making and everything to do with congressionally imposed constraints that cut against presidential power.6'
Conservatives want the 80-year-old centrist to step down and give President Donald Trump a chance to reshape the court in a more conservative mold. "Justice Kennedy is the most powerful jurist in the world," said law professor Jessica Levinson of Loyola Law School. "The longer he stays on the court the greater the chance he can shape the legal doctrine for years to come." But Kennedy didn't say anything in public Monday, and the court's actions might provide good reasons for him to stay. Take the travel ban for instance. Kennedy voted to allow part of it to go in effect as it applies to foreign nationals with no "bona fide" connection to the United States. But three of his colleagues -- who wanted the entire ban to go into effect -- think that the "compromise" that Kennedy joined will cause chaos as parties in the coming days and weeks grapple with what actually constitutes a "bona fide" connection. Kennedy might see the need to help shepherd in a resolution to the complicated case concerning the role of the executive when the court hears the full case this fall. "The world -- and justice Kennedy -- likely suspect that both those challenging and defending the so-called travel ban are arguing to an audience of one," Levinson said.
However, both deconstruction and AC citizenship perspectives suggest that either extreme – SSD as abstract and depersonalized technocratic information exchange and SSD as highly personalized and conviction-driven – are problematic because both perspectives of SSD assume that convictions or speech acts are stable. For instance, many performance debaters contend that their convictions and the meaning of their experiences are formed and stable prior to communication. These attempts to regulate competitive debate through stable identities and beliefs are problematic. In comparison, supporters of fiat- based policy debate assume that convictions change and are tested through debate. However, these proponents often assume that the meaning of a resolution is always stable and predictable across a number of contexts, which allows for an anticipated switching of sides on the resolution each debate. However, one of the lessons of deconstructive speech act theory is that the meaning of a text is always already shifting and unstable, as texts do not have inherent and secured meaning (Derrida, 1988). As a result, attempts to police and dismiss performance- style debating or regulate access to arguments based on sincerity depend on an inaccurate view of communication and the emerging political sphere. In response, we need a new definition of SSD that recognizes the value of deconstructive speech act theory for both performance- and traditional policy-styles of debate. ¶ We should not define switch-side debate in reaction to fears about the conservative (e.g., “acting in support of communist China makes one a communist”) or liberal (e.g., “roleplaying as the state is imperialist”) ideological indoctrination of students and the ethics of those pedagogical choices. These concerns misunderstand the inherent and ontological instability or play or polysemy contained in all communication and its effects (Pada, 2009). Rather than viewing the resolution as defining and stabilizing the inherent meaning of a resolution and clearly demarcating each side of that statement, we should view the resolution as an artifact that has unstable and contestable meaning. The instability of the resolution as an artifact is inevitable as different teams, judges, tournaments, and documents deploy the resolution in different contexts in many different ways. Even when exact meaning is policed through topicality, no single topicality debate ever plays out the same way, thus ensuring variation and difference through citation. ¶ In this perspective, SSD does not have to be at odds with performative speech acts. Instead, SSD should be defined as switching sides on an orientation or perspective towards a set of words that operate as an unfixed resolutional text. These orientations would exist on a continuum with many ways to approach the resolution. One of those orientations could be to read for the presence of framers’ intention located in the syntax and arrangement of the resolution’s terms as a “partial, if not, a total glimpse of the author’s intentions” (Pada, 2009, p. 87). This perspective would likely best serve traditional federal government-centered policy debate as it provides a source of predictability found in an unstable resolution. On the other end of the continuum, affirmatives might approach the resolution as a debate about identities and experiences that are both included and excluded by the text. These debates should not be determined on a strict ethical system defined by the authenticity or sincerity of beliefs or performances, but instead on the perlocutionary effects that the speech acts have. This would best preserve a space for performance- style debate while allowing for negative arguments like counterplans and disadvantages. ¶ Maintaining that the resolution is an unstable artifact does not default us into a nihilistic situation without stable communication or debate (Pada, 2009). According to Derrida (1988), the ontological possibility of play and instability does not mean that communication and a semi-stable resolution is impossible. As Pada (2009) explains, play always “implies a possibility and not an absolute condition of miscommunication....Différance does not mark the end of communication, rather, for Derrida, it opens new possibilities that are latent behind the text” (pp. 82-83). Thus, debate can begin with grammar and other cues for intent and meaning of the resolution, but there must always be room for a critique of that reading’s exclusions and consequences. This redefinition of switch- side debate allows a great deal of space for both traditional policy and conviction and performance-style debaters to operate. Additionally, it acknowledges the ontological instability of speech acts and their illocutionary effects, which opens up a number of possibilities for both policy and performance-styles of debate.

Attempts by opponents of immigrants’ rights to weaken support for comprehensive immigration reform have long tried to shove an array of wedge issues into the movement in attempts to split it.
B-1. Key Risks across Sectors and Regions Key risks are potentially severe impacts relevant to Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which refers to “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” Risks are considered key due to high hazard or high vulnerability of societies and systems exposed, or both. Identification of key risks was based on expert judgment using the following specific criteria: large magnitude, high probability, or irreversibility of impacts; timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability or exposure contributing to risks; or limited potential to reduce risks through adaptation or mitigation. Key risks are integrated into five complementary and overarching reasons for concern (RFCs) in Assessment Box SPM.1. The key risks that follow, all of which are identified with high confidence, span sectors and regions. Each of these key risks contributes to one or more RFCs.36 i) Risk of death, injury, ill-health, or disrupted livelihoods in low-lying coastal zones and small island developing states and other small islands, due to storm surges, coastal flooding, and sea level rise.37 [RFC 1-5] ii) Risk of severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods for large urban populations due to inland flooding in some regions.38 [RFC 2 and 3] iii) Systemic risks due to extreme weather events leading to breakdown of infrastructure networks and critical services such as electricity, water supply, and health and emergency services.39 [RFC 2-4] iv) Risk of mortality and morbidity during periods of extreme heat, particularly for vulnerable urban populations and those working outdoors in urban or rural areas.40 [RFC 2 and 3] v) Risk of food insecurity and the breakdown of food systems linked to warming, drought, flooding, and precipitation variability and extremes, particularly for poorer populations in urban and rural settings.41 [RFC 2-4] vi) Risk of loss of rural livelihoods and income due to insufficient access to drinking and irrigation water and reduced agricultural productivity, particularly for farmers and pastoralists with minimal capital in semi-arid regions.42 [RFC 2 and 3] vii) Risk of loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, biodiversity, and the ecosystem goods, functions, and services they provide for coastal livelihoods, especially for fishing communities in the tropics and the Arctic.43 [RFC 1, 2, and 4] viii) Risk of loss of terrestrial and inland water ecosystems, biodiversity, and the ecosystem goods, functions, and services they provide for livelihoods.44 [RFC 1, 3, and 4] Many key risks constitute particular challenges for the least developed countries and vulnerable communities, given their limited ability to cope. Increasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts. Some risks of climate change are considerable at 1 or 2°C above preindustrial levels (as shown in Assessment Box SPM.1). Global climate change risks are high to very high with global mean temperature increase of 4°C or more above preindustrial levels in all reasons for concern (Assessment Box SPM.1), and include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, substantial species extinction, large risks to global and regional food security, and the combination of high temperature and humidity compromising normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some areas for parts of the year (high confidence). The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger tipping points (thresholds for abrupt and irreversible change) remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing multiple tipping points in the earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with rising temperature (medium confidence).45 The overall risks of climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change. Risks are reduced substantially under the assessed scenario with the lowest temperature projections (RCP2.6 – low emissions) compared to the highest temperature projections (RCP8.5 – high emissions), particularly in the second half of the 21st century (very high confidence). Reducing climate change can also reduce the scale of adaptation that might be required. Under all assessed scenarios for adaptation and mitigation, some risk from adverse impacts remains (very high confidence).46
Under international law, there is no official definition of Indigenous, although the United Nations generally identifies Indigenous groups as autonomous and self-sustaining societies that have faced discrimination, marginalization and assimilation of their cultures and peoples due to the arrival of a larger or more dominant settler population. The word Indigenous was adopted by Aboriginal leaders in the 1970s after the emergence of Indigenous rights movements around the world as a way to identify and unite their communities and represent them in political arenas such as the United Nations. Indigenous was chosen over other terms that leaders felt reflected particular histories and power dynamics, or had been imposed by the colonizers. Given the diversity of Indigenous experience, no universally accepted definition has been drafted. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Discrimination against Indigenous Populations, José Martínez Cobo, developed a working definition for use with the Working Group of Indigenous Populations: Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems. The above definition distinguishes Indigenous peoples from the settlers, colonizers, or other populations who have attempted to undermine Indigenous autonomy. It was also carefully crafted to remove potentially problematic notions of race and blood quantum.
In sharp contrast to Iran, its revolutionary identity and revisionist tendencies, Saudi Arabia has traditionally been a proponent of the prevailing order and status-quo balance of power in the Middle East. This seems to be changing under Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who continues to receive extraordinary support from US President Donald Trump's administration. Whether it is an attempt to revise the status quo in favour of Riyadh, or prevent it from being revised by others, Saudi Arabia's nuclear and missile programmes are bound to have significant regional implications. Earlier this month, Tim Kaine, Democratic senator from Virginia, revealed that the Trump administration had approved the transfer of nuclear know-how to Saudi Arabia seven times, including twice after the murder of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in early October 2018. One of the transfers was authorised on 18 October, only 16 days after Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, was brutally eliminated inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, according to the US senator. "The Trump administration is seeking to negotiate a nuclear cooperation agreement that would allow Saudi Arabia to use US technology for energy purposes, but not nuclear weapons," Nicholas L Miller, professor of government at Dartmouth College, told Middle East Eye. "There is a concern in the administration that if the Saudis don't choose the United States as their supplier, they will turn to South Korea, Russia, or China, who tend to have weaker nonproliferation controls in their agreements," said Miller, the author of, Stopping the Bomb: The Sources and Effectiveness of US Nonproliferation Policy. Yet Trump's transactional and profit-centred approach to foreign policy-making - which arguably prompted his landmark 20 November statement of almost unqualified support for the Saudi leadership amid the Khashoggi fallout - and the secrecy with which US nuclear technology transfers to Riyadh are taking place, have raised doubts about the US resolve, or even ability, to keep possible Saudi nuclear ambitions in check. Trump's 'secret' approval In late March, the Reuters news agency disclosed the Trump administration's "secret" approval of licences for six US firms to sell atomic power technology to Riyadh. Simultaneously, the Saudis are seeking to develop a ballistic missile programme of their own, apparently with Chinese assistance. In November 2018, satellite imagery taken by the US company Planet Labs showed what appeared to be rocket engine tests for ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons at a military base near the town of al-Dawadmi, about 230km west of Riyadh. Saudi Arabia is gradually diversifying its alliances by fostering closer ties with Russia and China
The US's forceful interventionist agenda coupled with the impact of the 2008 global recession has had a detrimental effect on the US economy and provided a growing platform for anti-American sentiment internationally. With an ever increasing national debt and an inflexible and uncompromising Congress, America's internal affairs have tarnished its power capabilities in both absolute and relative terms. Furthermore, given the simultaneous economic rise of developing countries and most specifically, the rapid growth of India and China, emerging market nations have threatened the composition of global politics and imposed a possible limit to US relative power. For decades, declinist theory has provided a dampening outlook for the future of US power. The term 'imperial overstretch' (Kennedy, 1987) has been popularly coined to describe the US's modern failures in foreign policy and the eventual fall of the American 'empire' – a concept strongly opposed by proponents of US sustainability. Central to understanding the decline of US power is a substantive analysis of what makes a global hegemony; as shown within the body of this essay, these necessary and sufficient conditions when applied to the present-day United States, provide a worrying case for the future US power. This essay aims to evaluate the question at hand in two parts, the first being an analysis of intrastate themes within the US. By deconstructing the character of the state itself, such as the ideology surrounding the 'American dream' and critically assessing its 21st century reality, we are able to see a more diminishing view of US power. The second section looks at the evolution of interstate relationships in modern geopolitics and the role of the US within the new world order. Thus, by providing both an empirical and observational perspective, it becomes evident to see that the gradual transition from a unilateral to multilateral world is upon us. US power decline is no longer a possibility, but an inevitability demanding general acceptance.
The total number of petitions filed for U-visas has increased significantly in recent years. In FY 2009, U.S. Citizenship and immigration Services (USCIS) received 10,937 petitions for U visa status. By FY 2016, that number had increased to 60,710 petitions. In the Indianapolis case, according to the Department of Justice: [I]mmigration attorney Joel Paul, 45, of Fishers, Indiana, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Jane E. Magnus-Stinson of the Southern District of Indiana to an information charging him with one count each of mail fraud, immigration document fraud, and aggravated identity theft in connection with a scheme to submit fraudulent U-visa applications. Sentencing will be scheduled ... in early 2018. Pursuant to the plea agreement in that matter, Paul admitted that between 2013 and 2017, he had filed "more than 250 false Applications for Advance Permission to Enter as a Nonimmigrant on behalf of his clients and without their knowledge." In those applications, it was "falsely asserted that Paul's clients had been victims of a crime and had provided substantial assistance to law enforcement in investigating the crime." Significantly: With approximately 200 of the false applications, Paul submitted unauthorized copies of a certification he had obtained from the U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) for the Southern District of Indiana in 2013, using the certification without the USAO's knowledge to falsely claim that the applicant had provided substantial assistance in a criminal prosecution. Although U-visas have long been controversial (particularly because of concerns that the U-visa process is susceptible to abuse), where they are legitimately and appropriately utilized they provide both protection to victims and a tool for law enforcement officers to use in getting criminals off of the streets. This sort of fraud, however, makes it more difficult for actual victims of crime to get the protection they need, because it draws resources away from the adjudication of genuine applications. In addition, because there is a (quasi-) cap on the number of U visas, any fraudulently issued visa diminishes the number of legitimate applicants who could obtain one. Moreover, such fraud undermines the legitimacy of the U-visa program as a whole. The bigger question, however, is how Paul was able to get away with this fraud for so long. Logically, the large number of U-visa petitions that have been filed in recent years has placed a strain on USCIS's ability to screen for fraud in the application process. That said, however, it is unclear how the agency failed to recognize the fact that duplicate copies of the USAO certification had been filed in so many cases. It will be interesting to see whether USCIS revokes any fraudulently obtained visas arising from this case. Although Paul purportedly filed those applications "without [his clients'] knowledge", this does not mitigate the fact that any visas granted pursuant to this scheme were erroneously issued, and should be revoked. Finally, it is unclear what specific applications those clients believed they had filed, but at least some of Paul's clients must have realized that something was amiss.
Don’t call it the Venezuelan Missile Crisis. In fact, Russian troops in Venezuela barely rate as a crisis at all. The Trump administration is up in arms over an estimated 100 Russian troops and military advisers that were airlifted into Venezuela in March to support the embattled government of Nicolas Maduro. “Russia’s got to leave Venezuela,” declared Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, while National Security Adviser John Bolton warned that other nations shouldn’t establish military bases in the Western Hemisphere. It is understandable that Washington would be unhappy about Moscow’s support for a regime it would like to see overthrown. Or that Venezuela has spent billions on Russian arms, including jet fighters, helicopters and anti-aircraft missiles. Or that a pair of Tu-160 nuclear bombers has flown from western Russia to a Venezuelan airfield in a symbolic display of Russian aerial might. But how big a threat to U.S. security is a handful of Russian troops permanently stationed in Venezuela? Not much. To really threaten the continental United States from Venezuela, Russia would have to be capable of projecting power 1,400 miles—the distance from Caracas to Miami—or at least far enough out to threaten shipping lanes or the Panama Canal. That would mean putting missiles or long-range bombers like the Tu-160 and Tu-22M3 in Venezuela, or shorter-range tactical jets supported by air tankers. A deployment of that size would be noticed by U.S. intelligence. No White House administration could tolerate it, especially after word inevitably leaked to Congress and the press. Venezuela as a permanent Russian naval base, like the port of Tartus in Syria, is another possibility. That is, if the Russian Navy is capable of permanently operating a squadron in the Western Hemisphere. But again, any base that could service a large number of surface ships and nuclear submarines would be intolerable to Washington. As with Cuba or Nicaragua during the Cold War, a Russian outpost in Venezuela could function as an intelligence base in Latin America, or as a staging point to foment political conflict in the region. But that’s hardly an existential threat to the United State. And even then, too active a Russian presence would only energize Americans who wouldn’t mind sending the Marines for regime change in Caracas.
So there you have it: insatiable growth and consumption is destroying the planet and dooming humanity-but without ceaselessly growing production and insatiably rising consumption, we would be even worse off. Such is the lunatic suicidal logic of capitalist economics.
In nature, growth always slams up against non-negotiable constraints sooner or later. If a species finds that its food source has expanded, its numbers will increase to take advantage of those surplus calories—but then its food source will become depleted as more mouths consume it, and its predators will likewise become more numerous (more tasty meals for them!). Population "blooms" (that is, periods of rapid growth) are always followed by crashes and die-offs. Always.
As the 2016 presidential primaries got underway, there seemed to be several incontrovertible truths: Hillary Clinton’s nomination was inevitable, and Donald Trump stood no chance. Yet, here we are six months before the election, and Trump has seized the Republican nomination while Clinton is still working to box out Bernie Sanders’ insurgency (without losing his voters, who it turns out, may peel off after all). Nonetheless, the prevailing narrative is that while there is now a chance that Trump could actually win in November, it’s basically Hillary Clinton’s election to lose. Pundits focus on “fundamentals,” like Hillary’s superior fundraising, analytics, or ground game; however, these haven’t proven terribly predictive this cycle. And by focusing on conventional elements, analysts seem to be overlooking novel dynamics which are likely more important—specifically, the public’s persistent and negative perception of Hillary Clinton, the incumbency handicap, and a phenomenon I call “negative intersectionality.” ADVERTISING Change You Can Believe In Both Trump and Clinton hold historically unprecedented unfavorable ratings among likely voters. Of the two, Clinton has held a slight edge—however, the gap between them has been rapidly closing. And here’s the kicker: While it is true that the public is very familiar with both Trump and Clinton due to their decades-long careers in public life, Trump has been in the limelight primarily as a businessman and entertainer. People are just now discovering “Trump the politician”—and as a result, their views on Trump as a politician are malleable. The Clinton team views this as an opportunity, and are attempting to define him before he gets a chance to define himself. However, the flip side is that while Trump’s numbers are currently low, there is a real opportunity for him to radically change public perception for the better. And he has tasked Paul Manafort with this responsibility—a man who, after orchestrating Ronald Reagan’s landslide victories, went on to build a highly successful career rehabilitating the image of dictators and strongmen. He’s made for this job. Expect Trump’s numbers to rise. Hillary’s numbers are unlikely to follow the same trajectory—because not only do people know her well, but they know her specifically as a politician. It is precisely her perceived cynicism and duplicity as a politician that drive her unfavorable rating. Public opinion of Clinton has been on a steady decline since December 2012, and a brutal, negative campaign is unlikely to shift the numbers in her favor. In other words, Clinton will have a much harder time turning around her bad image than Trump. As an example, consider Trump’s “policy surrealism”: by the normal rules of the game, it should hurt him that he is constantly changing his mind, that he insists anything he says prior to the election should just be thought of as a “suggestion” rather than a position, etc. Why doesn’t this bother voters? Because his primary rival is Hillary Clinton. Clinton has been known to “evolve” frequently and dramatically as well. But the difference between them is that Hillary has very successfully framed herself as a policy wonk, and with the assistance of her large team of professional advisors, each new position she strikes is accompanied by a host of highly polished (if often unrealistic) policy proposals. However, this professionalism often proves as much of a curse as an asset: When Trump flip-flops, it seems like he is genuinely trying to work through these issues—he straightforwardly tells you what he feels at the moment, and changes his mind as he learns more, thinks more, etc. Clinton, on the other hand, is a veteran politician—as she herself constantly underscores—with a tightly controlled message. As a result, her position shifts seem more like cynical pandering. That is, in a sense, Trump’s evolutions actually make him seem more honest, while Clinton’s have the opposite effect. It’s somewhat unfair, because of course there is a clear element of pandering in Trump’s evolutions, and at least some of Clinton’s policy shifts may be the product of sincere changes in perspective, new information, more life-experience, changing circumstances, etc. But fair or not, this does seem to be the emerging dynamic of the race. Worse still, this avowed expertise, when paired with her modest and highly technical proposals, positions her as the consummate insider in an election cycle where people across the political spectrum seem hungry for an anti-establishment revolutionary. And while the Clinton campaign is still trying to figure out how to best define Trump (most recently insisting that he is not a “normal” candidate, failing to understand that many voters will see this as a positive), her interlocutor has no such problems: “Crooked Hillary” is simple but effective, hitting her right where she’s weakest. A Referendum on Obama’s Administration and Bill Clinton’s Historically speaking, it is rare that a party that completed two terms in the Oval Office manages to win a third. Granted, Obama has been a transformational president, and his popularity remains high. However, the problem facing Hillary is that she’s not only going to be held to account for the failures and shortcomings of the Obama administration, but also of her husband’s tenure in office. Consider: Despite Hillary Clinton’s unparalleled credentials, her historic potential as the first female POTUS, her early and nearly insurmountable delegate lead, and the near-unanimous and robust support from the Democratic Party establishment throughout—she is having trouble “closing the deal” for the nomination. This is because, in many ways, the Democratic primary has been a referendum on Bill Clinton’s tenure—and many of his signature achievements, championed by Hillary Clinton at the time, don’t look so great in retrospect. From NAFTA, the repeal of Glass-Steagall, Wall Street deregulation, welfare reform, DOMA (the Defense of Marriage Act), “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—and of course, the infamous crime bills—despite Bill Clinton’s success at restoring the Democratic Party to national prominence, primary voters have taken an increasingly critical view of his legacy. This effect will be even more pronounced among Independent and Republican voters. Trump recognizes the opportunity here, and has already demonstrated an intention to hammer Hillary Clinton not only on her support of NAFTA—but to even undermine her feminist narratives by highlighting the genuinely disturbing sexual assault accusations against Bill Clinton, and the role that Hillary Clinton played in attempting to discredit and silence alleged victims. Again, in the current cultural and historical moment, voters seem unlikely to provide the same benefit of doubt that was afforded the Clintons in the ’90s. And so the challenge Hillary Clinton faces is somewhat unprecedented: Americans are overwhelmingly dissatisfied with the state of affairs in this country. To the extent that they blame Obama for their problems, this hurts Hillary. To the extent that they blame Bill Clinton for their problems, this hurts Hillary. And unfortunately, Hillary Clinton was even complicit in many of the worst decisions of the intervening Bush administration–for instance, playing a pivotal role in marshaling support for the ill-conceived U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. In short, the incumbency handicap, which would be significant for virtually any Democrat in 2016, will be particularly pronounced against Hillary Clinton. Losing the Culture Wars Many Trump supporters may well be racist, xenophobic or misogynistic—but if the Democrats think that it will be a winning strategy to sling these kinds of labels at the Donald, then they are going to be in for a nasty surprise in November. For one thing, Trump’s parochialism resonates with many more Americans than the mainstream media likes to believe or acknowledge (although their obsessive coverage of the Donald is an implicit recognition of this reality). This is true across the board: male and female, young and old, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, highly-intelligent or not, Democrat or Republican (this is particularly true for his anti-Muslim proposals). And his nationalistic economic and foreign policy message resonates even more broadly: a majority of Americans support his “America-first” approach. So if the Clinton camp attempts to disparage people who hold these kinds of views as ignorant and bigoted, they are going to be alienating far more voters than they can likely afford. Exacerbating this trend is something I call “negative intersectionality”: progressives have done a great job framing racial inequality, feminism and LGBTQ rights as part of the same basic struggle. However, this association works both ways. Accusations of misogyny, for instance, are often heard in the context of a fundamentally anti-white, anti-Christian culture war—a zero-sum campaign waged against ordinary hard-working Americans by condescending and politically correct liberal elites. As a result, many conservative white women who may be disturbed by Trump’s remarks would simultaneously feel antipathy toward liberals when they encounter a pro-Clinton ad that highlights those comments. Some may even come to view Trump more sympathetically if Democrats attempt to paint him as anti-woman or anti-minority. If Clinton thinks she can criticize Trump as a sexist without stirring up this broader resentment against liberals, she is in for a rude awakening. If she thinks there’s an alternative path to victory by largely writing off the white vote and leaning more heavily on the support of minorities, she’s probably wrong about that too: Clinton would simultaneously need massive turnout and near-unanimous support from minority groups to compensate for decreased support among white Americans. However, turnout has been low among Democrats in the primary. Moreover, Trump seems to be performing surprisingly well among minorities: Mitt Romney only garnered 6 percent of the black vote in 2012. However, this election is shaping up to be more competitive: nearly one-tenth of African-Americans view the Donald positively, with another 15 percent undecided. If even half of the latter group ultimately sides with Trump, or simply stays home on Election Day, Clinton loses. For her to win, African-American participation needs to at least match 2012 turnout, and Clinton must win roughly 90 percent of the black vote. Right now, it’s looking like she might fail on both counts. Perhaps more shocking: despite his anti-immigrant rhetoric, nearly one-quarter of Hispanics support Trump, with another 15 percent undecided—putting him on pace to possibly exceed Romney’s 2012 share (27 percent). One reason to suspect these dynamics might hold: positive intersectionality. Trump’s ambivalence on gay marriage, his opposition to the so-called “Bathroom Bills” in North Carolina and elsewhere, his consistent praise for Planned Parenthood, his commitment to loosening the Republican platform on abortion, and his openness to legalizing marijuana (which would have a huge and positive impact on people of color)—these will counteract depictions of him as a xenophobe or bigot among those who view these struggles as interconnected. In fact, Trump’s unorthodox positions, when paired with the public’s record distrust of mainstream media, may lead many to believe he is being unfairly maligned in the press. The Straight and Narrow In short, contrary to prevailing narratives, the deck seems to be stacked against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Of course, there’s always the hope that Trump could implode. But so far he has demonstrated an amazing ability to lean into gaffes and controversies, and to control the terms of debate. And with his primary buttoned up, Trump is softening and moderating his “suggestions” for the general electorate—and again, he is empowered to make radical shifts in a way his opponent is not.
China and the United States will work together to try to prevent further missile tests by North Korea, US President Barack Obama says. In recent weeks, North Korea has carried out a hydrogen bomb test and repeatedly test-fired missiles. Mr Obama met Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a nuclear summit in Washington on Thursday. But hours later, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said the North appeared to have test-fired another missile. The latest test saw what appeared to be a ballistic missile land off the east coast of the Korean peninsula, Yonhap reported. Mr Obama said he and Mr Xi were seeking to agree "how we can discourage action like nuclear missile tests that escalate tensions and violate international obligations". Mr Xi, quoted by China's state news agency Xinhua, said it was critical all parties "fully and strictly" implemented newly-agreed sanctions. China is North Korea's closest ally and largest trading partner. Zheng Zeguang, China's assistant foreign minister, said the presidents had a "candid and in-depth exchange of views on a variety of issues...and reached an important consensus". He called the meeting "positive, constructive and fruitful". North Korea's nuclear test on 6 January and a satellite launch on 7 February were violations of existing UN sanctions. Since then, the UN and Washington passed further sanctions on Pyongyang. The UN steps were drafted with support by China and reportedly came after two months of negotiations between Beijing and Washington. Previous UN sanctions imposed after North Korean tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 did little to dispel its nuclear ambitions. Much of the burden of making sure the sanctions are implemented is falling on China. Under the new measures, any North Korean ships arriving in China must be inspected for contraband and imports halted if there is proof profits from those exchanges go towards the North's nuclear programme. Washington has long pushed for Beijing to put more pressure on North Korea. A White House statement in February said China's "unique influence over the North Korean regime" gave it the chance to do so. A map of previous North Korean nuclear tests China's foreign ministry last week said it was keen to push for wider talks on North Korea, involving a number of regional powers, during the meeting with Mr Obama. There was no confirmation whether new talks were agreed on Thursday. Mr Obama also vowed to closely work on the same issue with its allies South Korea and Japan after meeting their leaders on Thursday. "We are united in our efforts to deter and defend against North Korean provocatiosns," he said.
I have looked at Canada‘s visa requirement decision in such detail because it is an excellent example of the essence of unilateralism in world politics. In other words, when explained from the perspective of Canadian interests, the visa decision makes considerable sense. Needless to say, however, the unilateralist doesn‘t care about the interests of others – that‘s what makes it unilateralist. So in this case, only Canadian interests were considered; Mexican interests were completely unimportant, as were all those business interests in Canada affected by the dramatic decrease in visitors from Mexico. Moreover, officials in Ottawa calculated correctly that Mexico was in no position to introduce a mirror visa requirement, which would have instantly dried up tourists from Canada. But the visa decision is important because it demonstrates so clearly how little impact multilateralism has on Canadian policy towards Mexico, thus making sense of Pastor‘s puzzle. It also shows how little interest the Canadian government has in developing a relationship with Mexico that goes beyond the dual-bilateralism that has marked the North American project since NAFTA came into being.
Recognizing the strategic value of oil for their national interests, superpowers will not hesitate to unleash their economic and military power to ensure secure access to oil resources, triggering worldwide tension, if not armed conflict. And while superpowers like the United States maintain superior conventional military power, in addition to their nuclear power, some weaker states are already nuclearly armed, others are seeking nuclear weapons. In an anarchic world with many nuclear-weapon states feeling insecure, and a global economy in downward spiral, the chances of using nuclear weapons in pursues of national interests  are high.
Most commentators would probably agree that Espinoza is exactly the kind of “criminal alien” who deserves to be deported. There is a broad left-right consensus that, no matter what one’s general opinion on immigration is, those who commit serious crimes ought to be expelled from the country. Though Espinoza had lived in the U.S. since he was an infant, he was born in Mexico and his presence in the United States was therefore a violation of the law.
Russia operates six nuclear-powered icebreakers and one additional vessel is being built. The ships are based in Murmansk and perform an important role assisting shipping on the Northern Sea Route. Their operation has been fraught with difficulties but oil exports from the Kara Sea have recently revived demand for their services. An accident involving a nuclear-powered ship could cause marine pollution. It is unlikely that radiation from the site of an accident off North Russia would reach Iceland. Icebreaking operations take place a long way from this country and currents would carry the radiation further away. Nuclear reactors used in ice-breakers are far smaller than those used in nuclear power stations. However, nuclear accidents represent a serious environmental hazard. Iceland has objected strongly to the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Britain that releases radioactive material into the sea, even though the radiation is negligible by the time it reaches the middle of the North Atlantic and is well inside the strictest health limits. Other Nordic countries have for many years voiced their objections to nuclear reprocessing in Russia, on the Barents Sea coast and Novaya Zemlya. The Russian parliament has passed legislation to allow the storage of foreign radioactive waste on Russian territory. A reprocessing facility is planned in Tjeljabinsk, Siberia. Nordic governments and others have voiced their concerns over these plans. It is vital that Iceland monitors developments in nuclear-powered shipping on the Northern Sea Route and any discussion regarding the transport of nuclear waste by that route or anywhere close to the Icelandic coast.
Since the end of the Cold War, the EEZ has dramatically increased in importance compared with the high seas. Today the high seas have become relatively less important for military operations. The U.S. Navy budget illuminates this point. In the decade from 1989 to 1999, the share of the Department of the Navy budget dedicated to the Marine Corps and naval support for littoral warfare increased from 20 percent to nearly 30 percent. 111 In the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. Navy deployed aircraft carrier battle groups in response to overseas contingencies more than any other type of vessel. The Center for Naval Analysis reports that on more than 15 occasions during the 1980s, and nearly 20 occasions during the 1990s, aircraft carriers were the naval instrument of choice. Amphibious Ready Groups (ARGs), composed of a squadron of amphibious warfare ships and a Marine Expeditionary Unit, were deployed in response to a crisis only a fraction of the time as an aircraft carrier task force. In the 2000s, however, the number of Amphibious Ready Group deployments skyrocketed to more than 25, while the number of aircraft carrier responses plummeted to less than five. The reason: As the “Swiss Army knife” of naval force structure, the Amphibious Ready Group can do so much more than drop bombs, and can perform these multiple tasks at the same time.
Global warming will have “severe, pervasive and irreversible” effects, touching everyone on the planet, says the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. People can expect to face more floods, droughts and violent storms as emissions of carbon dioxide, mostly from burning fossil fuels, feed the greenhouse effect and drive up global temperatures. A “large fraction” of species will face extinction and both human conflict and poverty will increase as resources dwindle, said the report, Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. “These are multibillion dollar events that the rich are going to have to pay for, and there’s a limit to what they can pay,” said IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri.  Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Photo by Mikhail Evstafiev (Photo credit: Wikipedia) Yet for the first time, the IPCC is offering a glimmer of hope. It acknowledges that some of the changes will be beneficial – including higher crop yields in places like Canada, Europe and Central Asia – and that in others cases, people will be able to adapt to them. “The really big breakthrough in this report is the new idea of thinking about managing climate change,” said Dr Chris Field, the global ecology director at the Carnegie Institution in Washington and a co-chairman of the report. “We have a lot of the tools for dealing effectively with it. We just need to be smart about it. “Climate-change adaptation is not an exotic agenda that has never been tried,” said Field. “Governments, firms, and communities around the world are building experience with adaptation. This experience forms a starting point for bolder, more ambitious adaptations that will be important as climate and society continue to change.” Adaptations could include better flood defences or building houses that can withstand tropical cyclones. Vicente Barros, another co-chairman, said: “Investments in better preparation can pay dividends both for the present and for the future.” Despite the shift, one scientist, Professor Richard Tol, an economist at Sussex University, withdrew his name from the report claiming that it was still too “alarmist”.
Under the Skilled Worker Program applicants’ skills are assessed on the basis of a ‘point system’. Potential immigrants are granted acceptance based on the number of points they can accumulate in six categories: education (graduate degree holders receive maximum points); official languages (fluency in writing, reading, listening and speaking both national languages guarantees maximum points); age (ages 2149 receive maximum points); work experience (working five years or more in a specific field provides maximum points); potential employment in Canada (pre-arranged work guarantees the highest number of points); and adaptability (ability of an individual and his/her family to settle and live comfortably in Canada based on the employment and education of spouse or dependants) (CIC 2007). The number of points needed to be eligible for immigration constantly fluctuates based on the economic conditions (i.e., the economy is booming and in need of new workers), labour force needs (i.e., specific occupational shortages), and, historically, public opinions at the time (i.e., openness of existing Canadians to ‘accept’ new immigrants) (Kelley and Trebilock 1998). While the goal of the Skilled Worker Program is to address labour shortages in Canada, increasing evidence demonstrates that the majority of immigrants who enter Canada through the Skilled Worker Program are unable to secure full-time permanent positions in their field of training. For example, the results of Canada’s first Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada1 found that between two and four years after arrival, 54% of immigrants are still looking for work (Statistics Canada 2007b). Of those who are able to find employment, 60% settle in careers for which they are over qualified (Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council (TRIEC) 2003). Previous research has demonstrated the existence of three key barriers to employment for immigrants arriving under the Skilled Worker Program. These include a lack of recognition of foreign credentials, delayed assessment by provincial regulatory bodies, and a lack of Canadian employment experience (Brouwer 1999, Bauder 2003). As a result, many remain unemployed or underemployed. The term ‘underemployment’ has been recently used to describe circumstances when individuals are employed in positions that underutilise their education and skills (Freidland and Price 2003). For instance, 55% of skilled immigrants in Ontario who are able to find work within six months of landing do so outside their field of expertise (TRIEC 2003). Most of these jobs are part-time, lack the security of permanent employment, and rarely utilise the skills and education of the skilled immigrants (Brouwer 1999, Bauder 2003, Albiom et al. 2005, Reitz 2005). While the current situation of immigrant under/unemployment has become an important area of concern among policy-makers and researchers in Canada (Bauder 2003, Lochhead 2003, Albiom et al. 2005, Reitz 2005, Girard and Bauder 2007), little attention has been directed towards the health-related impacts of such employment 186 J. Asanin Dean and K. Wilson Downloaded by [Florida International University] at 12:59 06 January 2015 circumstances among skilled workers. This is surprising considering that the association between secure employment and positive health has been widely acknowledged. Indeed, employment is recognised as an important social determinant of health in Canada and elsewhere (Wilkinson and Marmot 2003, Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) 2004, Raphael 2004, Marmot and Wilkinson 2006).
The Heritage framework proposes a radical restructuring of Indian education programs. It calls for the creation of Education Savings Accounts for students who attend Bureau of Indian Education Schools. That funding would equal 90 percent of the per pupil funding formula. The idea is that students could use this money at any school, including private ones. “Such an option would provide a lifeline to the 48,000 children currently trapped in BIE schools which have been deemed the ‘worst schools in America.'” The idea stems from a Heritage Issue Brief on Education by Lindsey Burke. The paper says “it’s appropriate for Congress to seriously consider ways to improve the education offered to Native American children living on or near reservations. Instead of continuing to funnel $830 million per year to schools that are failing to adequately serve these children, funds should be made accessible to parents via an education savings account, enabling families to choose options that work for them and that open the doors of educational opportunity.”
To illustrate the importance of federal education funding and highlight the local impact of the President’s proposed cuts, CEF hosted a panel today on Capitol Hill of education practitioners with experience implementing education programs for early childhood education, elementary and secondary education, adult education and workforce training, and postsecondary student aid, as well as an advocate from PTA. Educators shared today the impact the budget would have locally: “Federal support for special education only covers 15 percent of the additional cost of educating students with disabilities, which is far below the 40 percent promised when Congress enacted IDEA (the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). Without an increased federal investment, state and local education budgets have to make up the shortfall, which limits their ability to finance other education services. We know that as a result of this shortfall, local and state funds must cover the costs of IDEA programming thus preventing LEAs from expanding in other areas, especially early childhood.” – Phyllis Wolfram, Executive Director of Special Programs for Springfield Public Schools, Springfield, MO, and President-Elect, Council of Administrators of Special Education “Students in WV and all of Appalachia desperately need the funds provided through federal education funding. Our local resources are limited due to a low tax base; and our children’s needs our great. Federal dollars help us provide some of the specialized help we need for these youngsters.” – Deborah Akers, Superintendent, Mercer County Schools, Mercer County, WV “The President’s budget would impose devastating cuts to important federal financial aid programs that allow low-income students to attend college and attain their degrees. These cuts jeopardize the next generation of young workers. In particular, Federal Work-Study and the Federal Perkins Loan assist low- and middle-income students in different ways in their pursuit of a higher education.” – Heather Boutell, Director of Financial Aid, Bellarmine University, Louisville, KY.
One might reasonably argue that the success of these piecemeal reforms would give the regime more breathing space to survive. This is a valid concern, but is analytically unsound. The regime has survived despite a terrible twenty-year economic depression that began after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Although it sounds counter-intuitive, economic success will be the harbinger of structural collapse in Cuba.
Americans Provide Generous Economic Aid Through the Remittances Foreign Workers Send Home to Support Their Families. No. The United States hosts many immigrant workers who send home money each month to help support their extended families by paying for school fees, food, housing, job training, and medicine. But these remittances are not aid, and they are certainly not an indicator of U.S. generosity or stinginess. Remittances stem from market-based labor transactions, not generosity. Workers trade their time and skills for a paycheck in a mutually beneficial exchange. When those workers send the money back home, it is an intra-family transfer, not a charitable gift. Just because these flows help fight poverty does not make them aid. Private bank loans, foreign direct investment, and trade also help reduce poverty, but they are not aid, either. Consider remittances that flow in the opposite direction. Thousands of Americans work in low-income countries around the world, and many of them send funds back to their families in the United States. But when an American working for Pertamina Oil Company in Indonesia sends money back to his or her grandmother in Florida, that money is clearly not Indonesian foreign aid to the United States. Some argue that remittances can still substitute for aid, but this assertion is only partially true. One difference is the regional disparities in their destinations. Remittances from the United States are heavily concentrated in Latin America and much scantier in the poorer countries of Africa and South Asia. Of the $28 billion in U.S. remittances to developing countries in 2003, the majority went to middle-income countries, and more than half went to Latin America. Only about $0.5 billion went to sub-Saharan Africa, or about 75 cents per Africanhardly enough to ease poverty in a continent where income averages about $500 per year. In addition, government policy only modestly and indirectly affects remittances, so the United States cannot direct them to the neediest countries (in response to a natural disaster, for example), or use them to support U.S. foreign-policy goals. Remittances are an important complement to aid, but they are not a substitute.
Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC) decided to introduce a power generation and water production system utilizing ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) technology developed by a Japanese venture, Xenesys Inc. KNPC and Xenesys will sign an official contract in the summer of 2007. OTEC is a clean power generation system utilizing temperature difference between cold deep seawater and the warmer surface. As it needs a difference of 15 degrees Celsius or more to generate electricity without any fuel, tropical and sub-tropical regions within 30 degrees of the equator are suitable for this system. Technological development of OTEC began in earnest after the oil crisis of the 1970s. The world's first practical OTEC plant became feasible with the invention of a new OTEC system known as the "Uehara Cycle" developed by the research team of Dr. Haruo Uehara at Saga University, Japan. Obtaining an exclusive license of the government-patented system, Xenesys developed practical technologies for OTEC power generation and water production through its joint research with Saga University. Saudi Arabia is considering the construction of this new OTC plant as well. Xenesys is also working to introduce its new technology to Thailand and other countries along the Indian Ocean.
If I make a coercive threat – if I tell you, for instance that I'll break your legs if you don't stay out of Malibu – I limit your options. It's not that hanging around in Malibu 8 is no longer an option for you. It's that you no longer have the option of hanging around in Malibu with your legs intact. 6 A coercive threat limits the options of its recipient in that it removes the option of both avoiding the threatened consequence and doing the thing the coercer has demanded not be done. Now, it is often true that one is worse off the fewer options one has available. This is not always true, of course. But in cases of coercion – at least wrongful coercion – it's very likely that the option removed by the threat is one that the coercee would prefer to have open to her. If this were not true, the threat would either be unnecessary or ineffective
The key point here is that such concerns are not judicially manageable; they should be left to political accountability and conscience. By the same token, current immigration enforcement priorities (applicable quite apart from the DACA and DAPA programs) merely focus enforcement efforts for the time being on cases the executive branch judges to be most important.214 As OLC explained, the priorities accord with the limited general guidance Congress has provided with respect to enforcement,215 plausibly identify the most important cases for emphasis given severely limited resources, and once again avoid any definite assurance of nonenforcement to any particular immigrants outside the priority categories.216 While some again might question whether the priorities are correct, or whether they reflect the best effort at enforcement the government could undertake, these questions are not judicially manageable by conventional criteria.
Led by the leaders of the Partido Independiente de Color (Independent Color Party) Evaristo Estenoz and Pedro Ivonnet, the rebellion was designed to force Cuban president, JosÃ© Miguel GÃ³mez (1909-1913), to repeal the MorÃºa law which had been passed in 1910 and outlawed the formation of political parties on racial lines, therefore banning the Partido Independiente de Color. MorÃºa himself was a mulatto. Just six months before the presidential elections of November, 1912, Estenoz thought that an armed uprising was the last possible resource that the Partido Independiente de Color had to fight against the MorÃºa law. On May 17, Estenoz arrived in the province of Oriente from a trip to the United States, and with his arrival the rumors of a black uprising spread. On May 18, the Cuban newspaper 'La Lucha' attributed an uprising in the town of Sagua la Grande in the province of Santa Clara to the Partido Independiente de Color. Although some uprisings took place in the provinces of Santa Clara and Matanzas--in the center of Cuba--mass arrests of party leaders and suspected sympathizers aborted all prospects of a coordinated national rebellion, and the movement was confined to the Southeastern province of Oriente. While Afro-Cubans constituted 30% of the total population nationally, they comprised over 40% of the Oriente population. (Data from 1907 Census in Fermoselle, 1974, p. 89; and Velasco, 1913, p.77). Furthermore, the socio-economic situation of the Afro-Cuban population in Oriente had rapidly deteriorated as a consequence of the expansion of sugar plantations and mills that eliminated communal lands and small farms. Afro-Cubans also saw their socio-economic condition worsened due to the increase of population and the introduction of cheaper labor from Haiti and Jamaica (LÃ³pez, 1986). Consequently, black protesters in Oriente attacked what they saw as the sources of their oppression and impoverished state: foreign property, cane fields and sugar mills.¶ Meanwhile, the newspapers repudiated the action of those men that, as one editorial would say, "had chosen to stop being Cubans, to be only blacks" ('La Lucha,' La Habana, May 27, 1912, p. 1) and stimulated the panic of a 'Negro uprising' among the white population. Whites in the countryside fled towards more secure places in towns and cities. President JosÃ© Miguel GÃ³mez suspended constitutional guarantees in the province of Oriente and organized his aides to form volunteer civilian militias against the black movement, supplying arms and ammunition. His goal was to exterminate the black movement, and prevent military intervention by the United States (due to the Platt Amendment of 1901 the U.S. had the right to intervene militarily in Cuba to protect U.S. citizens and their property in the island).¶ In sum, although almost no armed protest occurred outside of Oriente, the whole island was overcome with fear of a black takeover. "Government forces suspected the entire Afro-Cuban population of collaborating with the rebels. Blacks and mulattoes found in the fields were considered rebels, unarmed peasants were believed to have hidden their guns, and all were treated without mercy. Black men and women living in towns and villages were assumed to serve as spies for the independientes." (Helg 1995, 221) The army and militias persecuted, arrested, and killed Afro-Cubans all over the island. They were killed and left unburied on the sides of the roads or hanging in trees as symbols of the official forces' strength to repel the rebellion.¶ But the harsh repression of the black movement did not prevent the U.S. from sending troops to Cuba. In June 1912, the U.S. landed more than 1,500 marines in the districts of GuantÃ¡namo and Santiago de Cuba to protect U.S. estates and mines. The U.S. marines did not participate in the repression of the 'independientes,' but their presence in Oriente indirectly contributed to the anti-black sentiment and violence. The 'independientes' were seen as anti-Cubans who might facilitate U.S. intervention.
It might seem alarmist to equate a civilian nuclear program with the weakening of the non-proliferation regime, the threat of a nuclear arms race, or the further deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations. Unfortunately, history and the facts support such a conclusion. A Venezuelan nuclear program is bad for global non-proliferation efforts. The civilian program is a necessary precondition for a weapons program and makes such a program possible. Venezuela’s close ties with Syria and Iran should cause observers to doubt just how seriously it will take its non-proliferation requirements under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the 1967 treaty making all of Latin America a nuclear weapons-free zone. Assuming that Chávez has the best of intentions now, there is the possibility that in the future he will choose to pursue nuclear weapons as a way to blunt U.S. power, shore up domestic support by rallying his people behind a nuclear crusade, or assert Venezuela’s role in the Americas. It is worth noting that leaders rarely announce that they plan to use peaceful nuclear technology as a stepping stone to a weapons program. Given Venezuela’s rich oil, gas, and hydroelectric resources, the need for a nuclear power program seems questionable. Considering Chávez’s willingness to stand with those who snub the global non-proliferation regime and his hostility towards the United States and western institutions, he must be considered a candidate to say one thing and do another on the nuclear issue. Playing cat-and-mouse with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has proven to be a good way to win international attention, exact concessions from the West, or raise fears in neighbors’ minds about the possibility that a country has nuclear weapons capabilities. Unfortunately, the IAEA has not come up with a good way to keep leaders from stonewalling or punish those who do so. Even if Chávez neither has nor develops the intention to pursue nuclear weapons, he will find it increasingly attractive to evade or complicate the IAEA inspection regime for other reasons. In so doing, he will provide yet another example of ways to exploit weaknesses in the global non-proliferation regime. Mixed signals from a nuclear Venezuela would have troubling implications for keeping Latin America free of nuclear weapons. Brazil and Argentina would most likely seriously reconsider their earlier decisions to forgo nuclear weapons in the face of a Venezuela with ambiguous nuclear priorities. If either country concluded it could not trust Venezuela’s statements on its nuclear program, a South American nuclear arms race could quite likely happen. Proliferation on the continent may start in Caracas but it would almost  certainly spread, ending the international success story of Latin America as a nuclear-weapons free zone.
There is a great deal of evidence that robotics and artificial intelligence could displace huge swaths of the American workforce in the next couple of decades. But the Trump administration, which has made job creation a central focus, doesn't seem to think it's a problem. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Axios cofounder Mike Allen on Friday that the threat of automation taking away jobs was "not even on our radar screen," and that the two-decade timetable grossly exaggerated what was likely "50 to 100 more years away." Report after report has forecasted a spike in unemployment if the US doesn't take steps to help workers as their jobs are scooped up by robots or AI. A 2015 McKinsey report, for instance, found that existing technology could feasibly replace 45% of work activities. Mnuchin seemed unfazed by that data. "I'm not worried at all," he said. "In fact, I'm optimistic." During his campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly encouraged companies to "buy American, hire American." During his presidency, he has pledged to work with large corporations to keep jobs within US borders. But as Business Insider's Pedro da Costa has said, many of the jobs Trump wants to bring back have not been shipped overseas — they've been lost to the cheap, consistent labor of robots. In many industries, such as telemarketing, customer service, and fast-food service, humans can't compete with the latest technology. "No one should be under the illusion that millions of manufacturing jobs are coming back to America," Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in the MIT Technology Review in November. Mnuchin also told Allen that Trump had "perfect genes" and an open-door policy at the White House, and that Trump deserved to be on a thousand-dollar bill
Accepting all of this, an agency does have some limited capacity to make credible commitments.42 There are no doubt a variety of in- teresting reasons for this, such as an agency’s ability to discern and rely on stable allocations of political, institutional, or economic power.43 Here this Article focuses on one formal, legal reason why agencies can commit to the stability of their policy over time. This is due to the operation of an administrative law doctrine that goes by different names but will be called here the Accardi principle. The complexities of that doctrine will be explored shortly, but consider now a simple statement of it: an agency has an obligation to follow its own rules.45 From the perspective of permitting an agency to credibly commit to future action, the most important feature of that doctrine is that its enforcement is not up to the agency, but is rather up to the courts.46 It is true that the courts only enforce the Accardi doctrine if a proper party comes along and brings a timely challenge to an agency’s failure to abide by its own rules, but if that occurs, a court can invalidate agency action that does not comply with existing rules. And all relevant parties proceed in the shadow of that possibility. Thus, if an agency chooses to embed its self-regulatory measure in a rule, it can rely on the fact that a court will require it to adhere to that rule in the future. This doctrine gives the agency some capacity to make credible commitments. The problem of a government agent promising adherence to a policy in the future is that the government agent (or her successor), absent some effective enforcement mechanism, can thereafter ignore the promise.47 Government can say today that it will respect contract rights, but tomorrow it can exercise its coercive powers in ways that ignore them. The availability of an effective third party enforcer of the original promise permits the agent to back it with some level of credibility and thus induces whatever behavior the original promise was intended to facilitate.48 And an effective third party enforcer of self-regulation is what the Accardi doctrine provides. An agency can say today that it will only bring certain cases and not others, and, if the doctrine applies, parties can rely on the fact that a court will force the agency to follow it in the future. The Accardi doctrine provides third party enforcement of a par- ticular status quo baseline that the agency must follow—namely, the existing rules that limit the agency’s discretion. It is worth noting that it would be possible for the regime to be otherwise. It could be that every time a new administration begins its tenure, the prior adminis- tration’s self-regulatory measures would not bind the new administra- tion, or at least not be judicially enforceable by the courts. The new administration would start from scratch, as it were. Such a regime would have obvious advantages in terms of electoral responsiveness, but at a cost to stability. Regardless, it is not the regime we have.
Behaviorally, there are a multitude of examples that demonstrate that states explicitly tradeoff K12 funding for higher education funding. A recent, well publicized debate in the South Carolina Capitol in Columbia highlights such a battle.13 Despite the statutory requirements in most state constitutions that legislatures and budget officers practice “zero-base budgeting,” it is a rare scenario where states weigh and balance the recurring needs annually or biennially from the askings of the administrative officers of the respective departments. What actually happens is that budget directors and governors obtain a reliable estimate of what state revenues are likely to be for the ensuing fiscal period, mindful of the political consequences of increasing taxes or imposing income redistributions. Then, they place this figure on a chalkboard and draw a circle around it. All that remains is to parcel the slices to the different departments and institutions. This intensifies competition because all departments assume that the total available funding is limited to the figure placed on the chalkboard. If any slice is enlarged, it means other slices must shrink. Major attention is therefore paid to defending the allocations of the previous fiscal period, the status quo. In this atmosphere it is very difficult to get a hearing for the funding of any entirely new needs or for expansion of any existing services.
Arms for (Not That Much) Influence. Successful foreign policy involves encouraging other nations to behave in ways that benefit the United States. As noted, the United States has often attempted to use arms sales to generate the sort of leverage or influence necessary to do this. History reveals, however, that the benefits of the arms for influence strategy are limited for two main reasons. First, the range of cases in which arms sales can produce useful leverage is much narrower than is often imagined. Most obviously, arms sales are unnecessary in situations where the other country already agrees or complies with the American position or can be encouraged to do so without such incentives. This category includes most U.S. allies and close partners under many, though not all, circumstances. Just as clearly, the arms for influence strategy is a nonstarter when the other state will never agree to comply with American demands. This category includes a small group of obvious cases such as Russia, China, Iran, and other potential adversaries (to which the United States does not sell weapons anyway), but it also includes a much larger group of cases in which the other state opposes what the United States wants, or in which complying with U.S. wishes would be politically too dangerous for that state’s leadership.59 In addition, there are some cases in which the United States itself would view arms sales as an inappropriate tool. The Leahy Law, for example, bars the United States from providing security assistance to any specific foreign military unit deemed responsible for past human rights abuses.60 More broadly, arms sales are clearly a risky choice when the recipient state is a failed state or when it is engaged in a civil conflict or interstate war. Indeed, in such cases it is often unclear whether there is anyone to negotiate with in the first place, and governments are at best on shaky ground. At present the United States bars 17 such nations from purchasing American arms. As long as these nations are embargoed, arms sales will remain an irrelevant option for exerting influence.61 Apart from these cases, there is a large group of nations with tiny defense budgets that simply don’t buy enough major conventional weaponry to provide much incentive for arms sales. On this list are as many as 112 countries that purchased less than $100 million in arms from the United States between 2002 and 2016, including Venezuela, Jamaica, and Sudan. Lest this category be dismissed because it includes mostly smaller and less strategically significant countries from the American perspective, it should be noted that each of these countries has a vote in the United Nations (and other international organizations) and that many of them suffer from civil conflicts and terrorism, making them potential targets of interest for American policymakers looking for international influence. By definition, then, the arms-for-influence strategy is limited to cases in which a currently noncompliant country might be willing to change its policies (at least for the right price or to avoid punishment). The second problem with the arms for influence strategy is that international pressure in general, whether in the form of economic sanctions, arms sales and embargoes, or military and foreign aid promises and threats, typically has a very limited impact on state behavior. Though again, on paper, the logic of both coercion and buying compliance looks straightforward, research shows that leaders make decisions on the basis of factors other than just the national balance sheet. In particular, leaders tend to respond far more to concerns about national security and their own regime security than they do to external pressure. Arms sales, whether used as carrots or sticks, are in effect a fairly weak version of economic sanctions, which research has shown have limited effects, even when approved by the United Nations, and tend to spawn a host of unintended consequences. As such, the expectations for their utility should be even more limited.62 A recent study regarding the impact of economic sanctions came to a similar conclusion, noting that, “The economic impact of sanctions may be pronounced … but other factors in the situational context almost always overshadow the impact of sanctions in determining the political outcome.”63 The authors of another study evaluating the impact of military aid concur, arguing that, “In general we find that military aid does not lead to more cooperative behavior on the part of the recipient state. With limited exceptions, increasing levels of U.S. aid are linked to a significant reduction in cooperative foreign policy behavior.”64 Perhaps the most explicit evidence of the difficulty the United States has had exerting this kind of leverage came during the Reagan administration. Sen. Robert Kasten Jr. (R-WI) signaled the concern of many when he said, “Many countries to whom we dispense aid continue to thumb their noses at us” at the United Nations, and Congress passed legislation authorizing the president to limit aid to any state that repeatedly voted in opposition to the United States at the UN.65 In 1986, the Reagan administration began to monitor voting patterns and issue threats, and, in roughly 20 cases in 1987 and 1988, it lowered the amount of aid sent to nations the administration felt were not deferential enough. An analysis of the results, however, found no linkage between changes in American support and UN voting patterns by recipient states. The authors’ conclusion fits neatly within the broader literature about the limited impact of sanctions: “The resilience of aid recipients clearly demonstrates that their policies were driven more powerfully by interests other than the economic threat of a hegemon.”66 The U.S. track record of generating influence through arms sales specifically is quite mixed. U.S. arms sales may have improved Israeli security over the years, for example, but American attempts to pressure Israel into negotiating a durable peace settlement with the Palestinians have had little impact. Nor have arms sales provided the United States with enough leverage over the years to prevent client states such as Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, and Morocco from invading their neighbors. Nor have arms sales helped restrain the human rights abuses of clients like Chile or Libya, or various Middle Eastern client states. Although the United States has used the promise of arms sales or the threat of denying arms successfully from time to time, the failures outnumber the victories. The most rigorous study conducted to tease out the conditions under which arms for influence efforts are successful is a 1994 study by John Sislin.67 Collating 191 attempts between 1950 and 1992, Sislin codes 80 of those attempts (42 percent) successful. Sislin’s analysis is incomplete, however, since he looks only at the immediate benefits of arms sales and does not consider the long-term consequences. Furthermore, a close look at the supposedly successful attempts reveals that many of them are cases in which the United States is in fact simply buying something rather than actually “influencing” another nation. Thirty of the cases Sislin coded as successful were instances of the United States using arms to buy access to military bases (20 cases) or to raw materials (5 cases) or to encourage countries to buy more American weapons (5 cases).68 Without those in the dataset, the U.S. success rate drops to 31 percent. Finally, the conditions for successful leverage seeking appear to be deteriorating. First, Sislin’s study found that American influence was at its height during the Cold War when American power overshadowed the rest of the world. With the leveling out of the global distribution of power, both economic and military, the ability of the United States to exert influence has waned, regardless of the specific tool being used. Second, as noted above, the U.S. share of the global arms market has declined as the industry has become more competitive and, as a result, American promises and threats carry less weight than before. As William Hartung noted, “The odds [of] buying political loyalty via arms transfers are incalculably higher [worse] in a world in which there are dozens of nations to turn to in shopping for major combat equipment.”69
NATO Expansion Didn't Set Off the Ukrainian Crisis Russia hasn't been "encircled" by the West -- Vladimir Putin simply wants to be able to invade his neighbors at will. Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea has produced a great deal of handwringing in the West, with much of the ire directed at NATO. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's slow, 15-year process of expansion into the former Warsaw Pact nations, critics allege, sparked a tragic, three-stage process: It humiliated Russia, led to the country's encirclement, and provoked its aggressive behavior toward neighbors. NATO, they say, is a relic of the Cold War, serving no purpose other than to antagonize America's potential partners in the Kremlin. Blaming NATO's enlargement for Russian belligerence has been a feature of European security debates since the end of the Cold War, and a reliable excuse for explaining away every disagreement between Moscow and the West. "Wasn't consolidating a democratic Russia more important than bringing the Czech Navy into NATO?" New York Times columnist Tom Friedman scoffed after Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, in a column aptly entitled, "What did we expect?" Returning to this complaint after last month's invasion of Ukraine, Friedman declared that NATO expansion "remains one of the dumbest things we've ever done and, of course, laid the groundwork for Putin's rise." Fellow New York Times columnist Ross Douthat derided NATO expansion as a "neoconservative" project (pursued, oddly enough, by Bill Clinton) "to effectively encircle" Russia. And no less a figure than the late George F. Kennan concluded that "expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the post cold-war era." Tempting as it may be to castigate NATO for the deterioration of relations with Russia, nothing could be further from the truth: It was, and remains, the Russian regime's ideology, rhetoric, and conduct that provided the impulse for NATO expansion, not the other way around. Far from representing a historic error, the enlargement of NATO into Central and Eastern Europe has been one of the few unmitigated success stories of American foreign policy, as it consolidated democracy and security on a continent once scarred by total war. Faulting NATO for Russia's bad behavior betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of post-Cold War European politics, misrepresents the organization's role as a defensive alliance, and confuses aggressor with victim. First, a little history is in order. Russia's hostile actions towards neighbors hardly ended with the collapse of Soviet communism. On the contrary, Moscow continued to bully its former republics and satellites throughout the early and mid 1990s, even before the first round of NATO enlargement (to the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland in 1999). In 1992 and 1993 -- after Russia formally recognized the independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- Moscow cut off energy supplies to these small, reborn democracies in an attempt to pressure them into keeping Russian military forces and intelligence officers on their sovereign territory. From 1997 to 2000, according to former U.S. Ambassador to Lithuania Keith C. Smith, Russia halted oil shipments to the country no less than nine times after it refused to sell refineries to a Russian state company. To this day, the Russian Foreign Ministry maintains that the Baltic republics -- which Russia militarily conquered, occupied, and subjugated for nearly five decades -- "voluntarily joined the Soviet Union in 1940." The Balts didn't become part of NATO until 2004. Given this history, is it any wonder why these countries -- or any other country victimized by Soviet-imposed tyranny -- would want to join the alliance? Is it NATO's fault for saying OK? Critics of NATO expansion like to point out that, in exchange for earning Soviet acceptance of German unification, the United States and its allies promised not to expand the Atlantic alliance. This is a myth, stemming from a selective Russian interpretation of the diplomacy at the tail end of the Cold War. In February of 1990, with hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops still stationed in East Germany, then-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, traveled to Moscow to meet with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. A day earlier, President George H.W. Bush had sent Kohl a letter suggesting that East German territory be given a "special military status" -- the specifics of which would be determined later -- within NATO, implying that the alliance would indeed continue to expand. Hoping to earn speedy Soviet authorization for the removal of their troops and the unification of Germany, however, Genscher told Gorbachev that, "NATO will not expand itself to the East." But the Germans were not speaking for Washington, never mind the NATO alliance. Furthermore, as historian Mary Elise Sarotte has pointed out, Genscher's concession was never made in writing, and nor did Gorbachev "criticize Mr. Kohl publicly when he and Mr. Bush later agreed to offer only a special military status to the former East Germany instead of a pledge that NATO wouldn't expand." Ultimately, a legally binding agreement not to expand NATO beyond its pre-1990 borders never materialized, and Russia's latter-day claim that it was deceived by the West has no basis in fact. Russia's cries of Western betrayal are really just a smokescreen. Far from threatening Russia, NATO has repeatedly gone out of its way to be conciliatory. A 1997 agreement outlining relations between the two former adversaries stipulated that the NATO states had "no intention, no plan, and no reason" to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of its new members. These "three no's" were intended as an expression of goodwill and a reaffirmation of NATO's founding principle: that it is a defensive alliance with no designs on Russian territory. In the spirit of transparency, the organization founded the NATO-Russia Council in 2002 to facilitate cooperation between Moscow and member states. Not only did Western leaders repeatedly and explicitly make clear that NATO posed no threat whatsoever to Russia's security, some even suggested that Russia ultimately join the very military alliance that had been established to contain it during the Cold War. "We need Russia for the resolution of European and global problems," Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said in 2009. "That is why I think it would be good for Russia to join NATO." This hardly constitutes "cram[ming] NATO expansion down the Russians' throats," as Friedman alleges. Regardless, Sikorski was rebuked immediately by then-Russian envoy to NATO and now Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who retorted that "Great powers don't join coalitions, they create coalitions. Russia considers itself a great power...For the moment, we don't see any real change in the organization, we only see the organization getting ready for the wars of past Europe." With its invasion of Crimea, the first forcible annexation of European territory since World War II, it is Russia, and not NATO, that has returned the continent to "the wars of past Europe." More significant, however, was what this terse exchange revealed about the debate over NATO expansion: It has never really been about the enlargement of a defensive military alliance, but rather the nature of the Russian regime itself. If Russia had followed a democratic path (like the former communist states which joined NATO) and ceased posing a threat to its neighbors, there would have been nothing preventing it from becoming a suitable candidate for membership. After all, if the foreign minister of Poland, a nation historically terrorized by Russia and which is once again rearming itself in light of Crimea, proposed that Russia join NATO, who could possibly oppose it? As Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt aptly pointed out on Twitter recently, it was the "historic failure of Russia that a quarter of a century after fall of Soviet Union the new generations in its neighbors see it as an enemy," while, in contrast, "A generation or two after 1945 Germany is surrounded by countries that, after all the horrible pain and suffering, see it as a friend." Russia's hostility to NATO enlargement stems from the same root as all of its conflicts with the West: the zero-sum worldview and neo-imperialist agenda of President Vladimir Putin. . In 2005, he declared the breakup of the Soviet Union to be "a major geopolitical disaster of the 20th century." And if there was any remaining doubt that he intends to reconstitute the empire, Putin erased it with his furious March 18 speech to Russia's Federation Council in which he essentially reserved the right to invade and annex any territory where ethnic Russians claim to feel oppressed. To say that NATO expansion "laid the groundwork for Putin's rise," as Friedman does, gets the situation exactly backwards. Putin's ascent was almost entirely the product of domestic factors, namely, the economic chaos of the 1990s and the popular desire for a firm response to the insurgency in Chechnya. NATO expansion barely registered on the minds of ordinary Russians. With Russia amassing tens of thousands of troops on Ukraine's eastern border and stoking ethnic conflict in the hopes of providing a pretext for gobbling up even more territory, lending credence to Moscow's complaints about NATO expansion is intellectually irresponsible and geopolitically dangerous. In the midst of negotiations to deescalate the crisis, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has demanded that Ukraine essentially dismember itself into autonomous regions (the easier for Russia to meddle in the country's eastern provinces, which are heavily populated with ethnic Russians) and "firm guarantees" forswearing NATO and EU membership. Given that Russia has already invaded and annexed Ukrainian territory, and that it has shown no sign of discontinuing its aggressive behavior on the country's borders, these ultimatums constitute nothing less than a threat to use additional force if its demands are not met. Rather than firmly rebut these outrageous attempts to violate the sovereignty of an independent country, Secretary of State John Kerry has stated that Russia has "legitimate concerns" in Ukraine. This despite the fact that according to a new poll, 66 percent of ethnic Russian citizens there feel no pressure or threat from the new government in Kiev, a direct refutation of Moscow's relentless propaganda to the contrary. The assertion by Russia (and its Western apologists) that NATO constitutes a threat has always been a ruse. As was the case during the Cold War, it is Russia that threatens its neighbors today, not vice-versa. Russia's real reason for opposing NATO expansion, as one Ukrainian Foreign Ministry official told me in Kiev last month, is that the alliance's collective security provision would prevent Moscow from invading its neighbors, something that Russia has done twice in the last six years. It is for this reason that NATO -- and its expansion -- remains vital for European security and stability. To appreciate the hypocrisy of faulting NATO enlargement for the present predicament, one need only consider the claim that the military alliance has "encircled" Russia. There is only one country in Europe being encircled right now -- and it isn't Russia.
Not Quite a “Game Changer,” Actually: We Knew This Was Coming I have argued before against the alarmism that characterizes so much of the North Korea debate. It is worth reiterating a few points before this week’s cable-news punditry runs us over the edge toward airstrikes: • North Korea has been telling us for years that it wants a nuclear weapon and missiles. Today’s launch obviously worsens the situation, but not in ways we did not foresee. We have had time to think about how to respond (even if we seem bereft of good ideas). Hence my resistance to the “game changer” and “Franken-missile” rhetoric that so often accompanies these North Korean mini-crises. • North Korea almost certainly does not intend to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon. Even if we assume North Korea can strike the United States with such a weapon, it would be suicide to do so. And if there is one thing we have learned from the decades of decadence and gangsterism of North Korea’s ruling Kim family, it is that they like their luxuries. There is much debate about what precisely the Kims’ goals are (are they still really committed to unification?) but one obvious intention is to live up the good life. The Kims’ neronian habits are notorious—liquor, cars, women, yachts, palatial residences. This is the reason for the luxury-good ban on the regime and why it refers to that ban as “extra-large crimes against humanity.” These are no spartan, committed cadres living in caves according to a strict ideology, ready to die for their beliefs. So it is highly unlikely that the Kim elite would throw away their indulgences on a strike they know would bring devastating U.S. retaliation. • This weapon, rather, is intended to deter U.S.-led regime-change efforts. The United States has flirted for decades with attacking North Korea by air, most notably in 1994. The United States has also attacked many rogue states—Panama, Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya, to name just a few. It is therefore predictably rational for Pyongyang to seek the ultimate guarantee against such an attack. The program is not some madman’s dream to blow up the world, as Trump and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines have both suggested. If the Kims wanted that, they could have started a cataclysmic war years ago. The Kims likely also see the program as a hedge against Chinese domination. North Korea is economically dependent on China, but its nuclear program and general truculence with global norms signal that it will not become Beijing’s political satellite. In short, as long as the United States (and China) stay out of North Korea’s internal affairs, nuclear use is highly unlikely.
It goes both ways. Although there is no original state of freedom to which we can return, if structures of power are defined by what escapes them, then resistance is as much a part of the collective field as the tendency for capture by techniques of domination. This was Foucault's basic point: power and resistance are two sides of the same coin. Tendencies towards free action, towards escape from crystallized power structures, are as primary as the tendency towards capture I was just talking about. A powered structure is not all-encompassing. It rises from a field of emergence that includes it. It is plugged into a broader field of activity on which it feeds. That field is astir with tendencies pointing to the potential for different modes of structuration. They may not amplify past the point of incipiency, they may be captured, or simply fail to take and subside back into the field of bare activity from which they came, but still their difference cannot not have been felt at some level, in some way. So even if there is no unsullied state of freedom to return to, there is always a degree of freedom offering the potential for other emergences. There are always counter-tendencies that can be joined, and moved with, proposing themselves for amplification. There is always a margin of manoeuvre. What a body can do is tweak the field — improvise modulations of the field of activity in a way that takes up the offer of these different-order affective tendencies. What a body can do is trigger counter-amplifications and counter- crystallizations that defy capture by existing structures, streaming them into a continuing collective movement of escape. If the movement effects an intensification of the collective field through the mutual inclusion in it of reciprocally heightened capacities in contrastive attunement, then the degree of freedom has been increased across the board. Powers of existence have been collectively augmented. This can only occur from within, in situation, ﬂush with the event, in an immediacy of enaction. In this enactive immediacy, resistance is of the nature of a gesture. Resistance cannot be communicated or inculcated. It can only be gestured. The gesture is a call to attunement. It is an invitation to mutual inclusion in a collective movement. The only power it has is exemplary. It cannot impose itself. It can only catch on. Its power is to throw out the lure of its own amplification. Its power is of contagion. The gesture of resistance is a micro-gesture of offered contagion, oriented otherwise than towards the structures into which the gestures of microfascism occurring on the same level, in the same field, have the tendency to channel. All of this is very consistent with Gabriel Tarde's micro-sociology of ‘imitation’. But it also reinforces the notion that there is an aesthetic dimension — of allure, of style of gesture — that is not an added dimension but is absolutely integral to the very operation of resistance, one with its politicality. There is only one a priori: participation, participatory immersion in bare activity. Resistance comes of immanence. It cannot be led. If it is, it is already coagulating into an apparatus of capture poised to rise up and bear down, as if from above and outside. Resistance is immanent critique: a ‘critique’ that is one with its enaction. It occurs at the level on which bodies think more actively and feel more thinkingly, towards acting differently together. In this kind of resistance, there is no avant-garde. There are seeds. Seeds of free action blowing in the winds of bare activity, looking for a fertile field of attunement for their ﬂowering. The analogy is inexact. Such a field does not exist. In its role as exemplary gesture, resistance creates its own field. It gestures it into existence, by its own power of contagion. Resistance is performative of itself. It triggers its own self- organizing. Its field is always to come, ﬂush with its own self-amplifying event. Immanent critique, as its name implies, cannot purport to apply already-established criteria of correctness or necessity to the field of collective action. It cannot operate in the imperative, based on a prior political programme or already structured set of moral precepts. It cannot justify itself by appealing to established principles. It immanently enacts its own principle, which is one with its exemplary movement. There is no ought to resistance. On what basis can we say that it is better to desire one's freedom than one's servitude? That one ‘ought’ to resist? An ‘ought’ is nothing but an already assumed servitude to a higher order of imperative. To say ‘ought’ is to enact our servitude to abstract principle, and to justify our imposing it on others, as from outside and above. It's a power move. As such, it carries seeds of domination — perhaps a new order of domination, but domination nonetheless. Freedom, like oppression, is desired, or it is nothing at all. It cannot be ‘oughted’ and imposed. It cannot be inculcated. It is desired, or it is nothing. Resistance is the counter-desire for the collective augmentation of powers of existence, in dynamic mutual inclusion in an intensive field of contrasts. There is no basis on which we can say it is ‘better’ in principle. But there are ways to perform its desirability — to make it more desired, more strongly tended towards, more amplificatory and exemplary. There are indeed techniques of resistance. They are techniques of relation aimed at immanent field- modulation. They are gestures already in relation, in participatory immersion, stirring towards self- augmenting relational movement. This is closer to the anarchist notion of ‘propaganda by the deed’ than it is to traditional Marxist notions of ideology critique and vanguard action. Over the last two years, we have seen this kind of exemplary politics percolating up in many places around the world. The Occupy movement's refusal to advance a particular set of demands is a case in point. This refusal to set forth a programme was not a deficiency, it was an enablement. It was a way of saying that what was important was the gathering together of bodies and capacities in self-improvising collective movement for the production of surplus-value of life, and that democracy is that far-from-equilibrium movement — not its pre-programmed end in a prefigured stable structure. This is the ‘direct’, relational democracy of enactive resistance.
What went wrong? The administration, and many others, erred in believing that improved standing would give the United States greater policy leverage. The United States' standing among foreign publics and elites did rebound. But this shift did not translate into an appreciable increase in the United States' soft power. Bargaining in the G-20 and the UN Security Council did not get any easier. Soft power, it turns out, cannot accomplish much in the absence of a willingness to use hard power. The other problem was that China, Russia, and other aspiring great powers did not view themselves as partners of the United States. Even allies saw the Obama administration's supposed modesty as a cover for shifting the burden of providing global public goods from the United States to the rest of the world. The administration's grand strategy was therefore perceived as promoting narrow U.S. interests rather than global public goods.
Late Friday, following a five-decade-long legal battle to desegregate schools in Cleveland, Mississippi, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi ordered the Cleveland School District to consolidate its secondary schools.  The court rejected as unconstitutional two alternatives proposed by the school district, agreeing with the Justice Department that the only way to achieve desegregation is by consolidating Cleveland’s high schools and middle schools.
U.S. agricultural exports generated employment, income, and purchasing power in both the farm and nonfarm sectors. ERS estimates that each dollar of agricultural exports stimulated another $1.29 in business activity in 2011. The $136.4 billion of agricultural exports in 2011 produced an additional $176 billion in economic activity for a total economic output of $312.3 billion. Every $1 billion of U.S. agricultural exports in 2011 required 6,800 American jobs throughout the economy. Calendar year 2011 agricultural exports required 923,000 full-time civilian jobs, which included 637,000 jobs in the nonfarm sector. The agricultural export surplus helped to offset some of the nonagricultural trade deficit.¶ Introduction¶ Trade has always been important to U.S. farm and rural economies, from early colonial days when tobacco and cotton were the most important export commodities, to today’s massive exports of grain, oilseeds, and processed foods. Even though farming today accounts for a relatively small share of U.S. GDP, U.S. agricultural trade is still a significant contributor to the overall U.S. economy, with impacts felt in countries worldwide. As the world’s economies become more integrated, global trade and the links between countries grow ever deeper. Trade agreements have expanded agricultural trade with developed and developing countries and, in turn, have created growth opportunities for U.S. agriculture. By lowering trade barriers, free trade agreements, such as the North America Free Trade Agreement, create demand for U.S. agricultural commodities in foreign markets. This demand is satisfied with purchasing power acquired, in part, by the ability of foreign nations to increase sales of other products to the U.S. market.
He said that company officials have historically discussed cybersecurity issues with the NSA, but that he wouldn’t be surprised if those relationships are now strained. He pointed to news that the NSA posed as Facebook to infect computers with malware. “That does a lot of harm to companies’ brands,” Soltani said. The NSA’s actions have also made it difficult for the U.S. to set international norms for cyberconflict. For several years, the U.S. has tried to pressure China to scale back its cyberspying operations, which allegedly steal trade secrets from U.S. businesses. Jason Healey, the director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said the U.S. has “militarized cyber policy.” “The United States has been saying that the world needs to operate according to certain norms,” he said. “It is difficult to get the norms that we want because it appears to the rest of the world that we only want to follow the norms that we think are important.” Vines, the NSA spokeswoman, emphasized that the NSA would never hack into foreign networks to give domestic companies a competitive edge (as China is accused of doing). “We do not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of—or give intelligence we collect to—U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line,” she said. Jim Lewis, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, agreed that NSA spying to stop terrorist attacks is fundamentally different from China stealing business secrets to boost its own economy. He also said there is widespread misunderstanding of how the NSA works, but he acknowledged that there is a “trust problem—justified or not.” He predicted that rebuilding trust with the tech community will be one of the top challenges for Mike Rogers, who was sworn in as the new NSA director earlier this month. “All the tech companies are in varying degrees unhappy and not eager to have a close relationship with NSA,” Lewis said.
Chinese President Xi Jinping announced Monday his nation would work to take on a broader role in the international war against terrorism, promising Russian President Vladimir Putin China would be at his disposal to aid in anti-terror efforts. Russia has deeply involved itself in the Syrian civil war on the side of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The meeting between the two heads of state occurred on Monday, as they were in attendance at the international climate change summit in Paris. Chinese state news outlet Xinhua reports that their meeting focused largely on the fight against radical Islam, particularly the Islamic State (ISIS) in the Middle East. “Xi said against the backdrop that tremendous changes have taken place in global anti-terrorism situation, China stands ready to work with the international community, including Russia, to combat terrorism and uphold the common interest of the world,” China reports. The “international community” remark leaves the door open for China to work with other nations involved in hostilities in Syria and Iraq as well as other nations struggling to curb radical jihadist ideology. The Xinhua report does not explicitly single out radical Islam, however. It notes that Putin responded to Xi’s offer of cooperation by saying “Russia would like to work with China to enhance cooperation in such areas as anti-terrorism, and adamantly promote democracy in international relations.” While the article did not mention any specific terrorist threats, both nations are facing significant recruitment of their citizens by the Islamic State, Russia in the Muslim-majority population of Chechnya and China in western Xinjiang province, home to most of the nation’s Muslim Uyghurs. Following the talk between the world leaders, Russian news agency ITAR-TASS reported that Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would be visiting China from December 14 to 17. The announcement does not mention terrorism cooperation, instead noting that Medvedev will discuss with Chinese officials “a wide range of issues of trade-economic, scientific-technical, investment and industrial cooperation, as well as bilateral humanitarian and cultural exchanges.” China and Russia are also set to be working on a media project, according to Russian propaganda outlet Russia Today. Yuri Shuvalov, identified as the head of the State Duma Committee for Mass Media, said the media project would launch in 2016 as part of “the year of the Russian and Chinese mass media.” Russia and China have taken significantly different approaches to the turmoil currently engulfing Syria and Iraq. Russia has taken an active military role in Syria to defend its ally Assad, claiming to be targeting the Islamic State with airstrikes, but in reality spending most of its efforts in regions of the country largely devoid of ISIS activity. While pro-Russian Pravda claimed in September that China had strengthened its presence in the Mediterranean Sea, little came of the report and there is no indication of active Chinese military operations in the region. The decision to stay out of Islamic State territory has triggered a perilous dispute with Turkey, whose forces shot down a Russian fighter jet in November the Turkish government claims had violated the nation’s airspace. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has largely stayed out of the dispute, save for issuing a statement urging Russia and Turkey to “increase communication to avoid further escalating the situation. The international community should earnestly strengthen coordination and cooperation in the fight against terrorism to avoid this kind of incident from happening again.” And while Chinese Ambassador to Moscow Li Hui was among the first officials Russia consulted following the incident, Turkey summoned its Chinese ambassador, as well, and the Chinese government took no sides in public statements. China’s relationship with the Turkish government has been recently strained by its relationship to Xinjiang’s Uyghur population. The Turkish government issued a statement in July rebuking China for cracking down on the public observance of Ramadan, a Muslim holy month, with the Turkish Foreign Ministry stating it was “deeply concerned” and “saddened over the news that Uighur Turks have been banned from fasting or carrying out other religious duties in the Xinjiang region.” The government of Turkey considers Uyghurs ethnic Turks and, as such, the duty of Turkey to protect. Turkish nationalist protesters expressed themselves more pointedly, attacking a Korean tourist group and a Chinese Uyghur restaurant owner, mistaking both for ethnic Han Chinese. A Turkish nationalist leader excused the protesters by noting that Asian “slanted eyes” can be confusing to young Turks. Despite these tensions experts tell the South China Morning Post they do not expect China to take sides, despite its significantly warmer relations with Moscow than Ankara. “China will urge both sides to maintain restraint and solve the disputes through negotiation, but it has no interest in becoming a mediator and getting entangled in others’ disputes. The two countries are telling different stories… What they are fighting about is far more complicated than an airspace violation,” said Peking University international affairs expert Jia Qingguo. Few expect China to take on a more significant military role in the larger scheme of the war against the Islamic State, either, as Chinese officials have been keen to offer only diplomatic solutions to the war on terror. In a statement last week, for example, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei offered as solutions “relevant UN resolutions… carry[ing] out more cooperation in blocking cross-border flow of terrorists, cutting off the secret financing channels for terrorism, and fighting cyber terrorism.” Efforts by Chinese military officials did not appear on the list. Even in response to the murder of Fan Jinghui by the Islamic State announced this month, the Chinese government responded with a statement in which it declared that it “will continue to enhance counter-terrorism cooperation with the international community and safeguard world peace and tranquility,” without mentioning specifics. The beheading of Fan is the latest in a series of actions by the Islamic State that appear designed to tempt China into a military role against them. Xi’s statement alongside Putin is a sign that China may be willing to cooperate with allies like Russia on an elevated basis, though it fails to send the message that China is interested in any activities on the ground, or even diplomatic efforts between anti-ISIS nations.
Just as there are climate deniers, there will always be population deniers who refuse to acknowledge the impact population growth has on the planet. But that should not deter scientists from speaking out. Population, in one form or another, touches a whole host of scientific concerns, including climate change. Recent studies indicate slowing population growth could make a major contribution to slowing and ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, if world population grows, as currently projected, from 7.2 billion to 9.6 billion over the next thirty-five years, it is hard to imagine that we will succeed in meeting the ambitious targets that must be achieved to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The unwillingness of scientists to talk about population is shared by other professions. Many of those working overseas to alleviate poverty and hunger are similarly reticent to speak about population. The evidence, however, is clear: high fertility rates serve to perpetuate poverty, exacerbate food security and water scarcity, accelerate deforestation, and make it more difficult to improve living standards. Population growth, in other words, is a challenge multiplier, and for many developing countries, the challenges are formidable.
North Korea conducted a rocket launch on February 7, a day before the beginning of the February 8-25 timeframe it had originally provided for the launch. With diplomats from around the world scrambling to come up with a unified response, South Korea and the United States have already decided on one bilateral move: formally beginning talks over the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. That, in turn, has reignited hand wringing in China about the threat THAAD poses to Chinese national security.¶ In fact, official statements from the Chinese Foreign Ministry on THAAD deployment were more severe than its statements responding to the North Korean launch. Spokesperson Hua Chunying said China had “noted” and “regrets” the launch; meanwhile, in a separate statement, Hua said China was “deeply concerned” about the start of THAAD talks. Deploying THAAD in South Korea “will not help maintain regional peace and stability, nor will it lead to a proper settlement of the current situation,” Hua cautioned.¶ As a sign of China’s concern, Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin lodged representations over the issue with South Korea’s ambassador to China, Kim Jang-soo. Liu also summoned North Korea’s ambassador to lodge China’s protest over the rocket launch, implying once again that China sees THAAD as at least as threatening to Beijing’s interests as North Korea’s actions.¶ China’s Spring Festival began on Monday, and with most of the country on holiday, official responses will be muted for the next week. However, Chinese state-owned media is filling in the gap with its own arguments against THAAD deployment, which were raised repeatedly last year. Beijing believes that deploying THAAD in neighboring South Korea means the system would be aimed at China as much as at North Korea, constraining China’s military options in the event of a conflict. Its repeated response to the THAAD question has been, as Hua said on Saturday, that “no country shall undermine other countries’ security interests while pursuing its own
First, various measures simply exempt broad categories of federal agency action from NEPA, effec- tively repealing NEPA as to this type of activity. For example:¶ ■The “Real I.D. Act of 2005,” enacted as part of an Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill on May 11, 2005,27 empowers the Secretary of Home- land Security to construct barriers and roads along the U.S. border without complying with any legal requirements, including NEPA. The bill authorizes the Secretary to waive “all legal requirements such Secretary, in such Secretary’s sole discretion, deter- mines necessary to ensure expeditious construction” of such barriers and roads, and strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear legal claims (except for alleged constitutional violations) arising from use of this waiver authority. While ostensibly designed to address a specific dispute over a proposed fence along the Mexican border near San Diego, this measure could apply to the construction of any barri- ers and roads in the general vicinity of U.S. borders.
The report was produced by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime using data on thousands of species and seizures from more than 120 countries. It found that trafficking is faciliated by widespread corruption at many levels of government and society, and that crimes are generally not restricted to certain countries. To better fight wildlife crime, officials urge a stepping-up of enforcement and monitoring, as well as increased transnational cooperation. Wildlife trafficking is a global problem, revealed the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in their first-ever World Wildlife Crime Report. Released late last month, the report finds, among other things, that more ivory has been seized than cocaine, and that broad corruption is facilitating illegal trade in plants and animals. Developed by and part of UNODC’s ongoing Global Programme on Wildlife and Forest Crime, the report uses data provided by partner organizations under the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime like the CITES Secretariat and the World Customs Organization, and included an analysis of 164,000 wildlife crime related seizures from 120 different countries. “Based on the latest and best available data, and building on UNODC’s established expertise in researching and analysing multifarious aspects of transnational organized crime, this report comes at a decisive time, when the international community has clearly recognized the urgency of saving our planet’s flora and fauna from the predations of organized criminals,” Yury Fedotov, Executive Director of UNODC said during his remarks at the report’s launch.

Iconic species like tigers are now hanging on by a thread, he said, adding that populations of African elephants and rhinos, too, are under constant pressure from poaching. “But the threat of wildlife crime does not stop with these majestic animals….it also includes thousands and thousands of lesser-known animals, as well as marine and plant life, that are under serious pressure, and that cannot survive without our attention and help,” he said. A global issue Highlighting the sheer diversity and scale of this trade, nearly 7,000 species were included in the World WISE database of seizures analyzed by experts. Despite that, the report found not a single species represented more than 6 percent of the total seizures, neither is a single country the source of more than 15 percent of the seized shipments. In other words, these crimes are not restricted to certain countries, but are a global phenomenon. “One of the critical messages to emerge from this research is that wildlife and forest crime is not limited to certain countries or regions. It is not a trade involving exotic goods from foreign lands being shipped to faraway markets,” Fedotov said. “All countries play a role as either source, transit or destination countries, and we share a responsibility to act.” The report also showcases how gaps in legislation, law enforcement and the criminal justice system can cause serious problems. Traffickers and criminal syndicates, Fedotov said, will always look to exploit loopholes and the system wherever they can. The amount of illegal ivory seized worldwide in recent years was more than the amount of cocaine seized globally. According to the Elephant Trade Information System [ETIS], an average of about 30 metric tons of ivory was intercepted every year between 2009 and 2013. The report fortifies what conservationists have been worried about for a long time – the commodification of endangered species.

Linking ivory to cocaine further signifies how vast and profitable this trade is — with one major caveat. “Unlike cocaine or heroin, there is an absolute limit on the amount of ivory that can be produced, so there is a danger of a vicious cycle ensuing where each elephant poached increases scarcity, and thus the incentives for poaching another,” the report reads. A massive enterprise Released this week by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and INTERPOL, another report titled Rise of Environmental Crime estimates global environmental crime to be worth as high as $258 billion –26 percent higher than previous estimations. Environmental crime encompasses illegal wildlife trade, forest crimes, exploitation of minerals, illegal fisheries, trafficking of hazardous waste and carbon credit fraud. The UNEP/INTERPOL report finds environmental crime is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise following drug smuggling, counterfeiting and human trafficking, but that international agencies spent only $20 to $30 million combatting it. For perspective, the report states that a single fishing vessel targeting Patagonian toothfish was estimated to have taken in $200 to $300 million in illegal harvests. “It’s not just an environmental problem, it’s a threat to our societies,” Achim Steiner, Executive Director of UNEP told Al Jazeera. “First, it’s stealing from nations; secondly the proceeds finance conflicts and divisions in society. It’s a way of undermining our economies, let alone killing vital biodiversity and pushing some species to the point of extinction. It is something that the whole world has to work together on, it’s part of the phenomenon of globalisation,” he said. “We’re dealing with environmental crime, which is about much more than the poacher – it’s about criminal syndicates that are one day smuggling people, the next day weapons, the next day drugs.” Compounding the problem, not all illegally-obtained wildlife products (e.g., through poaching) are sold illegally. The UNODC report finds that when illegally traded wildlife is introduced into legal commercial channels, criminals have access to a much larger source of demand than they would have had on the black market alone. And just as with other sensitive products like firearms or pharmaceuticals, protected species can be legally traded internationally if accompanied by the right paperwork. The report says permits for around 900,000 legal shipments of protected wildlife products are issued annually and studies show that forged or fraudulent permits, sometimes acquired through corruption, have been used to traffic wildlife. Pangolins – or scaly anteaters – are considered a sought-after delicacy in China. The report found more than 100,000 illegally trafficked pangolins were seized between 2007 and 2013. All species are threatened, and several are endangered. Photo of an endangered Indian pangolin (Manis crassicaudata) by Sandip Kumar via Wikimedia Commons (CC 3.0). Image courtesy of UNODC, World Wildlife Crime Report: Trafficking in protected species, 2016. Corruption is one of the major drivers of the illegal wildlife trade, the report confirms. It uses the example of live apes, saying the illegal trade of such large, valuable animals would not be possible without fraudlent paperwork from corrupt officials. The report also asserts the rhino horn trade is facilitated by “pseudo-trophy hunters” operating via exploited hunting permits. “The World Wildlife Crime Report shows the extensive involvement of transnational organized criminal groups in these highly destructive crimes and the pervasive impact of corruption, demonstrating that combating wildlife crime warrants even greater attention and resources at all levels,” said John Scanlon, Secretary-General of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In fact, the report further substantiates the recent raid on a Buddhist monastery in Thailand and subsequent revelations of wildlife trafficking. “Case studies suggest that some wildlife farms, captive-breeding operations, or even zoos may play a role in laundering illegally acquired wildlife,” the report says. It references World WISE database numbers that list 380 tiger skin seizures occurred between 2005 and 2014. Given that there may be only 3,000 tigers left in the wild, the report estimates the ecological impact of those skins is far greater than their $4 million value. Closing the gaps Fedotov said the report’s findings help identify key policy implications that could help address gaps in current responses to wildlife crime. Outside the CITES system, he said, most national laws do not criminalize possession of wildlife that was illegally harvested or traded from abroad. One of the authors of the study, Theodore Leggett, told The Guardian, that laws could be proposed on national, international or regional levels to address this by, “effectively saying: ’If it is illegal in your country, it is illegal in my country’.” Rosewood is a catch-all term for multiple species of trees that are particularly sought-after for furniture production. Because of this demand, several species have been protected under CITES. Illegal logging is one of the most destructive environmental crimes since it can destroy habitat along with targeted trees. Photo of rosewood logs in Madagascar by Rhett A. Butler. Image courtesy of UNODC, World Wildlife Crime Report: Trafficking in protected species, 2016. In addition, Fedotov said, range countries must be supported in developing sustainable livelihoods for communities and to better protect their natural heritage. He also recommends strengthening customs security at ports and national borders, as data show most trafficking interceptions occurr there, as well as increasing the use of wildlife forensic science to ensure the proper identification of species. Fedotov urges the estalishment of new protected areas to overcome the ongoing problem of habiat loss, as well as addressing the major facilitators of wildlife crime and corruption must be addressed through the supply chain. He called on governments to use the UN Convention on Corruption and the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime to fight these crimes, and for the global demand for illegal wildlife products to be reduced. “If we want to get serious about wildlife and forest crime, we must shore up our collective responses and close these gaps,” Fedotov said. “All these efforts must be coordinated for optimal strategic effect and maximum impact.” For many, wildlife trafficking isn’t just concerning the plants and animals themselves, but is a larger issue that stands to affect the world as a whole. “Each year, thousands of wild animals are illegally killed, often by organized criminal networks motivated by profit and greed. I call on governments and people everywhere to support the new United Nations campaign, Wild for Life, which aims to mobilize the world to end this destructive trade. Preserving wildlife is crucial for the well-being of people and planet alike,” said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

The Annex VII approach would be the most effective resolution method and would lead to the most favorable outcome for the Philippines. The Philippines will likely not pursue adjudication in ICJ because the court would likely grant sovereignty over any islands to China. Furthermore, in coming to this unfavorable decision towards the Philippines, the ICJ would legitimize China’s actions in the SCS as evidence of China’s sovereignty.These actions are exactly what the Philippines is challenging in raising this dispute to the international arena. Allowing the ICJ to validate these actions, therefore, does not further the Philippines’purposes. Finally, continued negotiations are also not a viable option for the Philippines because any agreement would be inadequate to deter China from future actions in the SCS. The Philippines needs a judgment from a binding authority in order to strengthen the legal basis of all of the ASEAN states’ claims. Given that the SCS is central to the Southeast Asian economies due to its abundance of natural resources, ensuring access to these resources is an important consideration for the Philippines. A holding in the Philippines’ favor would enable the ASEAN statesto present a united front to China that the only acceptable basis for maritime claims in the SCS must be under UNCLOS. Furthermore, a decision by the tribunal establishing UNCLOS as the predominant authority governing the SCS disputes will benefit all parties by narrowing the areas in dispute and opening the door for joint development. Overall, not only will arbitration lead to the most efficient and favorable outcome for the Philippines, it will also lay the groundwork for future stability among all claimant states in the SCS.
Few findings in political science have received as much attention as the "democratic peace," the discovery that democracies almost never fight other democracies (Doyle 1986; Russett 1993). To some, the absence of military conflict among democracies is so consistent that it approaches the status of an "empirical law" (Levy 1988). Some authors have attempted to explain the democratic peace by highlighting the role of public opinion. They observe that democratic leaders are beholden to voters and claim that voters oppose war because of its human and financial costs. This argument, which dates to Immanuel Kant, predicts that democracies will behave peacefully in general--avoiding war not only against democracies but also against autocracies. History shows, however, that democracies frequently fight autocracies. A different possibility is that democratic publics are primarily averse to war against other democracies. If leaders are responsive to voters and voters are more reluctant to fight democracies than otherwise equivalent autocracies, then public opinion could play an important role in the dyadic democratic peace. To date, however, surprisingly few studies have investigated whether democratic publics are more reluctant to attack democracies than autocracies. 1Moreover, the small body of existing work has not accounted for variables that could confound the relationship between shared democracy and public support for war, nor has it investigated the mechanisms by which the regime type of the adversary affects the public mood. Despite decades of research on the democratic peace, we still lack convincing evidence about whether and how public opinion contributes to the absence of war among democracies. We used experiments to shed new light on these important questions.2Our experiments, embedded in public opinion polls that were administered to nationally representative samples of British and American citizens, involved a situation in which a country was developing nuclear weapons. When describing the situation, we randomly and independently varied four potential sources of peace: the political regime, alliance status, economic ties, and military power of the adversary. We then asked individuals whether they would support or oppose a preventive military strike against the country's nuclear facilities. Participants in our experiments were substantially less supportive of military strikes against democracies than against otherwise identical autocracies. Moreover, because we randomly and independently manipulated the regime type of the adversary, the observed preference for peace with other democracies was almost certainly causal, rather than spurious. Our findings therefore provide empirical microfoundations for the hypothesis that the preferences of ordinary voters contribute to peace among democracies. In addition to estimating the overall effect of democracy, we investigated the mechanisms through which shared democracy reduces public enthusiasm for war. Democratic publics may feel reluctant to attack other democracies for a variety of reasons: They may view democracies as less threatening (Risse-Kappen 1995; Russett 1993), regard democracies as more formidable opponents (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 1999; Lake 1992; Reiter and Stam 2002), or have moral qualms about using force to overturn policies that were freely chosen by citizens in another democracy. Despite volumes of research about the democratic peace, however, little is known about whether these factors influence the willingness of voters to attack other democracies. Using a unique experimental design and new techniques for causal mediation analysis (Imai et al. 2011; Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010), we find that shared democracy pacifies the public primarily by changing perceptions of threat and morality, not by raising expectations of costs or failure. Individuals who faced democratic rather than autocratic countries were less fearful of the country's nuclear program and harbored greater moral reservations about attacking. Those perceptions, in turn, made citizens more peaceful toward democracies. By comparison, respondents did not think that attacking a democracy would result in substantially higher costs or a lower likelihood of success than attacking an autocracy. Thus, our data help arbitrate between competing mechanisms, while also identifying morality as an important but understudied source of peace among democracies.
THOUGH THE CHINESE people may be pressing for their rights and better lives in their own ways, they have simultaneously exhibited unmistakable signs of anti-Americanism and nationalism that make them less receptive to the virtues of democratization. In an era when the Chinese communist ideology has become defunct through the pursuit of market capitalism, China has aggressively maligned Western-style democracy as chaos-inducing and unsuitable for the country's current economic conditions. Chinese citizens, argues Beijing, have the duty to pursue Chinese greatness that would result in a strong China, a powerful China, deserving of influence and glory. Economic modernization is key, with social stability as a mandatory accessory. Through its media, textbooks, and propaganda machinery, Beijing emphasizes that democratization, political liberalization, a free press, and anti-government protests will only bring about the collapse of the current regime and hence are dangerous and destabilizing for Chinese society. When the United States criticizes China's human rights abuses or advocates democratization, it is therefore acting as an overbearing and domineering hegemon and is only seeking to undermine China's rise. Ideological indoctrination has its consequences. Numerous Chinese citizens, particularly those in the emerging middle class, agree with their government that China is not ready for democratization. They see post-Soviet Russia's social instability, weakened economic growth, declining national power and overall chaos as most unappealing for China. In addition, they are deeply skeptical of U.S. motives. According to an opinion poll conducted by the Chinese newspaper Global Times (Huan Qiu Shi Bao) in 2006, some 59 percent of the Chinese people who live in urban metropolises believe that the United States is seeking to contain China, with 56.3 percent seeing the United States as China's competitor. (15) In addition, Chinese citizens recoil at U.S. criticisms of their government's human rights abuses. A similar Global Times survey in 2005 reports that almost 79 percent of the respondents have negative views toward U.S. criticism of China's human rights abuses: 49.3 percent believe that the United States is attempting to destroy stability in China; 10.4 percent believe that the United States is trying to make China look bad, and 19.1 percent believe that America simply does not understand China's internal situation.

Each individual thing, whether a living organism or an atom, has intrinsic value and there is a continuity between human and nonhuman experience. One's attitude toward a dog, which is a compound individual, differs from that toward a plant, which is also a compound individual but has no center of enjoyment, and toward a rock, which, as a mere aggregate, has no intrinsic value. All three, however, have instrumental value in supporting each other in the ecosystem." Process thought is consistent with an ecological attitude in two senses: (1) its proponents recognize the "interconnections among things, specifically between organisms and their total environments," and (2) it implies "respect or even reverence for, and perhaps a feeling of kinship with, the other creatures." Cobb and Griffin argue that process philosophy implies an ecological ethic and a policy of social justice and ecological sustainability: The whole of nature participates in us and we in it. We are diminished not only by the misery of the Indian peasant but also by the slaughter of whales and porpoises, and . . . the 'harvesting' of the giant redwoods. We are diminished still more when the imposition of temperate-zone technology onto tropical agriculture turns grasslands into deserts that will support neither human nor animal life." For Cobb's former student jay McDaniel, intrinsic value includes the entire physical world. Atoms as individual things have intrinsic value. Rocks express the energy inherent within their atoms. They too have intensity and intrinsic value, albeit less than that of living organisms. Outer form is an expression of inner energy. The assumption that rocks have intrinsic value, however, does not mean that rocks and sentient beings would necessarily have equal ethical value, but rather that they would all be treated with reverence. This could result in a new attitude by Christians toward the natural world, one that involves both objectivity and empathy." Philosopher Susan Armstrong-Buck also sees Whitchead's philosophy as providing an adequate foundation for an environmental ethic because intrinsic value is assigned to nonhuman nature. Process is the continuity of occasions or events that are internally related-each present occasion is an integration of all past occasions. Occasions, Whitehead wrote, are "drops of experience, complex, and interdependent." The world is itself a process of fluent energy; actual entities are self-organizing wholes. Differences exist in the actual occasions that constitute each entity. Intrinsic value is not based on an extension of self-interest to the rest of nature, but on the significance of each occasion and its entire interdependent past history. Assigning preferences to biosystems is based on the degree of diversity, stability, freedom of adaptation, and integration of actual occasions inherent in each 30 system.
The question being raised from the void of blackness is not one of either saying “yes” or “no” to solidarity, but instead explodes the bounds through which choices issue from. It is not a question for how to be with or against Israel, but instead demands we rethink how we can form solidarity in an infinitely more complex and violent situation. And no, it is not an adequate answer to say Frantz Fanon or Malcolm X or any other figure believed in a natural solidarity between Arabs and Blacks. They had their ways of answering this question, and yet the question still remains to be posed because of the perpetuation of the African slave trade in the region, the anti-black solidarity between Israel and the Arab nations, the black flesh that is beaten, burned, murdered. No, there is no easy answer to this question — it is a question that demands to be handled as the singularity it is. Shout outs to different activists working on the frontlines of the Palestinian struggle that recognize the centrality and singularity of anti-blackness in this entire affair. It is by meeting ya’ll that this question that I have always felt, from the days I cut my teeth as a young teenage activist on the question of Palestine, but did not know how to pose has percolated further in my mind now. The ASA resolution emerges directly out of an obfuscation of this work that is currently happening between certain activists on both sides. If solidarity is important, then all cards must be laid on the table at all times, never swept under the rug strategically to make things easier. This is not about intentions, but instead is a question of paradigm and what concepts center one’s analysis. The ASA resolution’s silence speaks louder than any individual’s intentions. The statement reflects an organization that looked into the abyss of black suffering and patted it on the head saying, “Its not your time. Maybe it was before, and maybe it will be later. But it will not be now.” We already know that the question of blackness can never arrive on time, its question is always posed too late to be considered or too early to be anything other than a nuisance. Contrary to the feeling of some, there has never been a black time, only an anti-black world where black people exist as its absent center, always too loud, needing to be silenced, yet always remaining unthought and hyper-present. It is for this reason that I cannot remain silent, the question that has been posed before must be re-posed incessantly, interminably, endlessly. It may never be a good time, but that is exactly why the time to pose the fundamental question of black suffering is right now. The time is now for ASA to answer for its omission. The time is now for all of us to answer to the centrality and singularity of black suffering, against the academic mode of analogization. The time is now to take up a new rubric for understanding anti-blackness, one that exceeds an anti-racist, marxist, feminist, or decolonial framework. No matter the context, the political issue, or social movement the question must be posed in order to force open a world where Black Lives can actually matter. It is the unflinching articulation of the unthought question stated loud, proud, and enraged that can obliterate the anti-black world — anti-blackness understood as something shared between reactionary and radical forces — and institute a new world, a Blackened world, a Black Era.
The Nation of Islam (NOI) emerged in approximately 1930 in Detroit, Michigan.1 In this time period, many black people in America were migrating from the South, where they experienced harsh conditions of indentured servantry and Jim Crow legislation, to the North, where the prospect of work and life was more promising.2 When they arrived and settled in the Northern cities, however, their hopes usually remained unfulfilled: expanding urban areas suffered because when black people moved in, white people moved out, and these areas quickly deteriorated into ghettos or urban slums; many black people could not find work; and the Ku Klax Klan was rising in popularity, even in the North. To cope with or adjust to unfamiliar and often dangerous urban life, and in search of a frame of reference through which the black experience could be understood, many black people in the North turned to newly flourishing black religious movements.3 Among them, the NOI was also a political organization, which evolved to be the most powerful Islamic organization in American history.4 In the beginning, the NOI was small: its founder W.D. Fard traveled door-to-door throughout Detroit, explaining to any willing ears his purpose: he was an Arab from the HolyCity of Mecca on a mission from God to reunite His lost chosen people and reintroduce them to their original way of life. Mattias Gardell clarifies Fard’s position, “the African Americans were of the lost, but finally found Nation of Islam, the tribe of Shabazz that had been stoned by the ‘Caucasian cave man’ or the ‘blond blue-eyed devil’ and brought as slaves” to North America.5 Only one year after the first recorded activity of the NOI, Fard met a man who would over the next three decades elevate the organization to national, and even international, relevance.6 That man was Elijah Poole, later to be known as the Messenger Elijah Muhammad.7 To manage the growth in popularity and membership of the movement, Muhammad created a bureaucracy, establishing temples nationwide, appointing administrative officials, and organizing schools and paramilitary units.8 Between 1934 and 1955 the number of NOI temples increased from two to thirteen, and by 1960 to over thirty.9 In Elijah Muhammad’s History of The Nation of Islam, he outlines the purpose or goal of the organization: “to reform our people in America and put them to themselves in some place where they can go for themselves and do for themselves.”10 The NOI invoked Islam as spiritual and political resistance to the racialized violence of the Western political and socioeconomic systems in which they were forcefully immersed. NOI leaders, most notably Muhammad and his protégé Malcom X, became heavily involved in the growing movement against anti-black, Jim Crow racism in America.11 But whereas their Southern Christian counterparts, like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), prioritized integration, civil rights, and equality under the law, the NOI sought separation from white society in order to achieve independent black nationhood and self-determination.12 Islam was an appealing religion for black people who felt disillusioned by the Christian church, its pro- integrationist messages, and with white Christians’ continued violence against black people and black non-violent protest.13 Sohail Daulatzai explains, “Islam was seen as ‘the Black Man’s religion,’ an alternative form of a radical black consciousness... that was internationalist in nature.”14 NOI leaders understood Islam as a point of connection between black people in America and the broader Muslim Third World, who experienced overlapping struggles and diasporas as a result of globalized white supremacy and Euro-American colonialism and imperialism.15
Driven by the search for his legacy in the Middle East, it seems President Barack Obama has decided to spend additional political capital on reviving Israeli-Palestinian talks before the end of his second term in office. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that the White House is working on a renewed peace push, including a possible Security Council resolution or other initiatives such as “a presidential speech and a joint statement from the Middle East Quartet.”
However before exploring more deeply the relation between nature and humans some elements need to be highlighted. First “the Arctic” millenary equilibrium is delicate. “The Arctic” is characterized by “extreme environmental conditions” (Page et al., 2009: 3), it should consequently not be surprising that it is vulnerable to change (Greenpeace, 2013c; Greenpeace, 2013f; Greenpeace, 2013g; Page et al., 2009: 9). But in so doing Greenpeace acknowledges the vulnerability of the equilibrium hypothesis as the movement parallel the last developments in military-security reasoning, undertanding the idea of mathematical chaos as an indiscernible pattern (see Bousquet 2010). Second as a system “the Arctic” can (still) be known, i.e. the many parts, their specific roles and the relations between them can be analysed and dissected. It is for this intelligibility that Greenpeace proclaims the Arctic should be “dedicated to peace and science” (Greenpeace International, 2012) Third, the balanced system of nature (“the Arctic”) can, and sometimes must, be acted upon. Unfortunately humans have already started to alter the equilibrium, introducing themselves, adding new parts, into the system without knowing the possible consequences. This is at the heart of the narrative of rupture that structure Greenpeace’s arguments in favour of a withdrawal of human industrial activity in the Arctic. It is only by tracing a “line in the ice” (Page et al., 2009: 9) from which point there will be a moratorium on industrial activity that this fragile ecosystem will be able to recover (Page et al., 2009: 15). This narrative of rupture implies, in a negative way, the previous existence of a now disturbed equilibrium. The narrative of rupture is linked to another important one: the narrative of catastrophe. In a number of moments Greenpeace insists on the potentially “devastating” and “catastrophic” effects of industrialism for the Arctic ecosystem, be it from oil spill, industrial fishing or accelerated climate change (Greenpeace, 2013g; Greenpeace International, 2012; Page et al., 2009: 8). The idea of catastrophe and uncontrollability is further reinforced by the use of notions such as “death spiral” (Greenpeace International, 2012) and “Arctic meltdown” (Page et al., 2009: 6). Strangely however this narrative departs from the traditional idea of equilibrium and related assumption that ecosystems are able to recover by themselves when the intruder is removed (Dalby, 2002: 128-30). According to Greenpeace things in the Arctic are not as simple anymore. The vulnerability of the equilibrium may lead, if severely disrupted, to tipping points from where things become unknowable and uncontrollable. As Greenpeace states in regard to the “feedback loop” of accelerating ice melt and climate change: “These are factors humans cannot control, and if we are to solve the climate crisis, we have to do it before these feedback effects get beyond recovery” (Greenpeace, 2013c, our emphasis).
This paper aims to contribute to a subdimension of this discussion, the one concerning the ties between economic interdependence and political discord in China – US relations. Economic interdependence is an especially important factor in the relationship, for it appears to be the strongest among the three causal mechanisms which, according to liberal optimists, are deemed to bring stability to China’s potentially disrupting re -emergence. Although Chinese participation in international institutions has certainly expanded in recent years, and there is indeed a wide range of common interests between China and the US in global issues, institutionalised cooperation has been less than intense between them. Moreover, while liberals continue to assume that China’s economic development will result 2 in its democratisation, this has not been the case so far. 3 Meanwhile, economic ties continue to deepen between China and the US. On the other hand, there appears to be a discord between the high level of China – US interdependence and their political relations, for their deepening economic linkages failed to mitigate continued tensions arising from an emerging strategic rivalry between them.
The truly devilish details of supply forecasts, however, rest in the production models of shale-gas operators. Arthur Berman, a Houston-based petroleum geologist and energy sector consultant, along with petroleum engineer Lynn Pittinger, has long been skeptical of the claims about shale gas. Their detailed, independent work on the economics of shale-gas production suggests that not only are the reserves claims overstated, but that the productivity of the wells is, too. The problems begin with the historical production data, which is limited. The Barnett Shale in Texas is the only shale formation, or "play," with a significant history. The first vertical well was drilled in 1982, but it wasn't until the advent of horizontal drilling in 2003 that production really took off. By horizontally drilling and then "fracking" the rock with a pressurized slurry of water, chemicals, and "proppants" (particulates that hold open the fractures), operators kicked off the shale-gas revolution. Drilling exploded in the Barnett from about 3,000 wells in 2003 to more than 9,000 today. Thus we have a reasonably good data set for the Barnett. Data from the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas are also reasonably substantial, dating back to 2004 and including roughly 4,000 wells. The data on the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana are minimal, dating to late 2007 and including fewer than 2,000 wells. The historical data for the rest of the major shale-gas plays—the Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Woodford—along with a handful of other smaller plays, are too recent and sparse to permit accurate modeling of their production profiles. After mathematically modeling the actual production of thousands of wells in the Barnett, Fayetteville, and Haynesville Shales, Berman found that operators had significantly exaggerated their claims. Reserves appear to be overstated by more than 100 percent Typically, the core 10 to 15 percent of a shale formation’s gas is commercially viable. The rest may or may not be—we don’t know at this point. Yet the industry has calculated the potentially recoverable gas as if 100 percent of the plays were equally productive. The claimed lifetime productivity, or estimated ultimate recovery, of individual wells was also overstated, Berman found. The production decline curves modeled by well operators predict that production will fall steeply at first, followed by a long, flattened tail of production. Berman's analysis found a better fit with a model in which production falls steeply for the first 10 to 15 months, followed by an more weakly hyperbolic decline. Shale-gas wells typically pay out over one-half their total lifetime production in the first year. So operators must keep drilling continuously to maintain a flat rate of overall production. Berman concludes that the average lifetime of a Barnett well might be as little as 12 years, instead of the 50 years claimed by operators, and the estimated ultimate recovery from individual wells might be one-half what is claimed. We will only know which models are correct after another five to 10 years for the Barnett, and more than a decade for the newer plays. Other issues Berman identified include artificially inflating the average well productivity numbers by dropping played-out wells from their calculations; improperly including production data from restimulated wells as if it owed to the initial well completions; and intermixing data from older and newer wells without aligning the data by vintage, giving the impression of significantly higher-than-actual production overall. Multiplying the error, operators seem to have applied their overly optimistic models of these older shale plays to newer plays, which may have radically different geological characteristics and might not be nearly as productive. For example, the lifetime output of Barnett wells may never be matched by wells in the Marcellus. The EIA makes reference to all of these issues in its assessment of the prospects for shale gas, noting that “there is a high degree of uncertainty around the projection, starting with the estimated size of the technically recoverable shale gas resource,” and that “the estimates embody many assumptions that might prove to be untrue in the long term.” Yet none of these issues are properly accounted for in the official financial statements of the operators. An example of how inflated initial resource claims can be, and how they can be sharply cut, presented itself in August with a new assessment of the Marcellus shale by the U.S. Geological Survey. It offered a range of estimates, from 43 tcf at 95 percent probability, to 84 tcf at 50 percent probability, to 114 tcf at 5 percent probability. (Not surprisingly, the 95 percent probable estimates have proven historically to be closest to the mark.) Only five months earlier, the EIA speculated in its Annual Energy Outlook 2011 that the Marcellus might have an "estimated technically recoverable resource base of about 400 trillion cubic feet." The USGS reassessment had slashed the estimate for the Marcellus by 80 percent. Similar adjustments may be ahead for other shale plays.
An additional 1,465 did not meet the legal criteria to become refugees, but were allowed to come to the United States and work legally as parolees, a kind of halfway status that does not offer a pathway to citizenship as refugees have, but protects them from deportation for two years. Those who have already received parole will not see any immediate changes when the parole program ends on Wednesday. But, as before, they will have to reapply for parole when the two-year period is up, Mr. Langston said.
There is no evidence that this litigation has or will reduce the defendant companies’ bottom lines or customer base, and¶ vague assertions that the pending litigation might result in “reputational” damage to the defendant companies is utterly¶ belied by the facts. Despite nearly two years of very public litigation in which AT&T has lost motions at every turn, AT&T¶ just announced record profits for the third quarter of 2007: a 41% increase over the previous year. AT&T publicly attributed¶ its success to signing a record number of new customers. As to possible threats faced by the companies and their personnel¶ here and abroad, permitting the litigation to proceed will not increase such risk as already may exist. Ironically, telecommunications¶ companies’ recent hand-in-glove participation in national security surveillance has been perhaps most¶ effectively broadcast around the globe by the Administration, including statements by the Director of National Intelligence,¶ along with other senior Bush Administration officials. Silencing the pending suits will not expunge these admissions from¶ the public record. Further, it strains credulity to suggest that the foreign enemies of the nation have not been aware for¶ decades of this obviously necessary partnership
Fusion centers provide a window into dominant forms and logics of contemporary securitization. They clearly embody an all-hazards orientation that pervades emergency-preparedness discourses and operations today (Lakoff,¶ TorinMonahan&NealA.PalmerThe Emerging Politics of DHS Fusion Centers633¶ 2006) and they develop within – and contribute to – a risk-management approach to policing and governance that seeks to control rather than elimi- nate threats and social problems (Simon, 2006; Wacquant, 2009). Moreover, even as highly secretive organizations, fusion centers embrace neoliberal rationalities of privatization and responsibilization. Public–private partner- ships are key to fusion-center operations, as is the use of private security analysts. Whereas responsibilization is typically theorized in terms of individuals who must consume security products and services not provided by the state (Rose, 1999; Katz, 2006; Monahan, 2009a), in this case it is state and local governments that are burdened with unfunded mandates and concomitant pressures to staff fusion centers even while cutting other social services. One could proffer a generous reading of mission creep by fusion centers and say that these are laudable efforts by state agents and others to make their work relevant to the perceived needs of their communities. Be that as it may, this article suggests that such efforts lend themselves to the violation of civil liberties and privacy, while rendering ambiguous laws and policies governing intelligence operations.
To study racism is to study walls. In every chapter of this book, we have looked at barriers and fences, restraints and limitations, ghettos and prisons, bars and curtains. We have examined a prison of racism that confines us all-people of color and white people alike. Victimizers as well as victims are in shackles. The walls of the prison forcibly separate communities of color and white communities from each other, as well as divide communities of color from each other. In our separate prisons we are all shut off from each other. The constraints imposed on people of color by subservience, powerlessness, and poverty are inhuman and injust; but the effects of uncontrolled power, privilege, and greed that are the marks of our white prison inevitably destroy white people as well. To dismantle racism is to tear down walls. The walls of racism can be dismantled. We are not condemned to an inexorable fate, but are offered the vision and the possibility of freedom. Brick by brick, stone by stone, the prison of individual, institutional, and cultural racism can be destroyed. It is an organizing task that can be accomplished. You and I are urgently called to join the efforts of those who know it is time to tear down, once and for all the walls of racism. The walls of racism must be dismantled. Facing up to these realities offers new possibilities, but refusing to face them threatens yet great dangers. The results of centuries of national and worldwide colonial conquest and racial domination, of military buildups and violent aggression, of over-consumption and environmental destruction may be reaching a point of no return. The moment of self-destruction seems to be drawing every more near, nationally and globally. A small and predominately white minority of the global population derives its power and privilege from the sufferings of the vast majority of peoples of color. For the sake of the world and ourselves, we dare not allow it to continue. Dismantling racism also means building something new. It means building an antiracist society. The bricks that were used to build the walls of the prison must now be used for a better purpose. Just as we must tear down wall brick by brick, so also we must build new structures of power and justice. Although we still need many more reminders that we cannot build a multiracial and multicultural society without tearing down the walls of racism, this negative reminder must be turned around and stated in reverse: we cannot tear down the walls without building new antiracist structures of power in our institutions and communities. Transforming and building anti-racist institutions is the path to a racism-free society.
Nonetheless, although operational circumstances may evolve over time, presidents generally inherit the same or similar ones of their predecessors. President Trump—despite his forthright approach—is as much of a captive to these constraints as were his predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Despite the president and his advisors’ proclamation that they will pursue different approaches than those of previous administrations, circumstances generally limit their degrees of freedom in the prosecution of military operations. Domestic Bureaucratic and Leadership Constraints on Military Operations Furthermore, presidents inherit both the domestic political, bureaucratic, and historical capabilities and constraints of the American political system and national security state. Incoming presidents invariably depend on a national security structure developed over decades. It includes, below the level of political appointees, many of the same personnel and, of course, standard operating processes, budgetary claims made by powerful congressional constituencies, legal constraints, administrative traditions, and institutional cultures. The size and structure of the national security apparatus by default reinforces a propensity for continuity and can therefore often undermine the grand promises of politicians. As many journalists and scholars have documented, especially in the wake of 9/11, the national security state has inexorably grown, with a base budget increase of more than 50 percent between 2001 and 2016.12 With that has come an increase in the size of its bureaucracy. That bureaucracy, broadly defined, now includes the Department of Homeland Security and the various intelligence agencies, those responsible for managing the massive growth of government contractors and private security services, and departments specifically created to address new forms of conflict across the entire electromagnetic spectrum (including cyber and space). Pointedly, national security professionals, regardless of their personal views and even any political differences, cannot simply be ignored; they are necessary for policy and strategy implementation. Indeed, they are more valuable than ever in the absence of more than half the number of key appointees. Furthermore, entirely consistent with the classic scholarship on bureaucratic and organizational behavior, their familiarity with ongoing operations and standard operating procedures generally reinforces the strategic status quo rather than radical change, often for fear of the unknown consequences of any major shift.13 Complete withdrawal from Afghanistan, for example, sounds good on a bumper sticker, but the long-held concern of thereby giving terrorists a base from which to attack the United States suggests otherwise. President Trump’s choice of leadership has reinforced this trend. The incoming leaders of national security departments often arrive intent on instituting dramatic strategic changes. Sometimes they even succeed in some aspects, a notable example being the changes in immigration policy instituted by the Trump administration’s Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to date.14 President Trump chose, however, to install three distinguished career military personnel at the apex of his administration: Lt Gen H. R. McMaster as his second National Security Advisor, Gen James Mattis as secretary of Defense, and Gen John F. Kelly, initially as secretary of Homeland Defense and now chief of staff. Their extensive and distinguished military careers socialized them to view strategic challenges from a pragmatic, operational perspective rather than a dogmatic one. McMaster’s studious personal manner reputedly grated the president, eventually leading to his departure. But if reports are to be believed, President Trump regards Mattis and Kelly as credible and authoritative to the point where he routinely delegates strategy to them.15 It is not surprising, therefore, to discover that they reputedly favor institutionally and culturally embedded conventions, abjuring many of the president’s more radical proposals (as McMaster did) when it comes to force deployment.16 In effect, they recognize the contextual factors that operate in differing theaters of war—such as Secretary Mattis’ insistence on sustaining troop deployments in Eastern Europe—that often reinforce the propensity for continuity.17 Commentators, such as George Will, expressed an early concern that Trump’s third national security advisor, John Bolton, may adopt a more aggressive approach to force deployment.18 At this point, however, there is no evidence by which to measure the relationship between Bolton’s fiery rhetoric and his prescriptions when it comes to deployments. Time will tell if Bolton will be willing and able to impose new deployment patterns on both his more cautious colleagues and a possibly recalcitrant bureaucratic apparatus. Thus, while sounding a cautious note, the available evidence to date has generated an ironic paradox in President Trump’s case. The vacuum created by his administration’s lack of senior appointments, coupled with the training of many of those he has appointed to leadership roles, has collectively reinforced the natural tendency to be circumspect in instigating any major operational changes.
Since the modern oil industry began, experts have consistently fretted that the world’s supplies were on the verge of running out. In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt warned of “imminent exhaustion.” In 1956, M. King Hubbert famously predicted U.S. oil production would peak around 1970. Peak oil production prognostications were all the rage just a decade ago. Each time, those predictions have proven incorrect, as new oilfields have been found and as technological innovations unlocked previously unforeseen ways to economically extract oil and gas. The most recent was the shale boom, which has put the U.S. on a path to zero out oil imports and sent world prices into a tailspin over the past few years. Global oil demand may peak, as climate policies and technologies like electric vehicles advance, but it won’t be because we run out of oil. So what’s next? The coming wave of disruptive innovation in the energy sector is likely to be driven by digital tools bringing together artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, supercomputing and automation. In the public’s imagination, AI’s impact on the energy sector has perhaps been most widely celebrated with visions of us all moving about in a fleet of self-driving cars. AI is also rightly touted as accelerating the shift to clean energy, for example by boosting the output of renewables and energy efficiency, or by better integrating distributed renewable energy sources into the grid. Yet less noticed in the public discussion about AI and other digital tools is how they could also transform more traditional energy sectors, such as oil and gas, upending our current understanding of how much oil and gas can be produced and at what cost. Digital innovation is an equal opportunity disrupter. AI will improve oil and gas production rates and lower costs. With advances in quantum computing, machine learning and AI, tools can now be used to troubleshoot underperforming wells, enhance reservoir modeling, carry out preventive maintenance before problems arise, optimize well design, drilling and completion, and even use machines to carry out tasks on unmanned, automated drilling platforms and well pads. The shale patch is well-suited to the application of new technologies given its shorter investment cycles. Shale oil break-even prices have come down from around $70 per barrel in 2013 to $50 today, and Goldman Sachs projects they could fall $10 further with the application of both today’s leading-edge technologies and new digital tools like AI. Offshore oil and gas production will also benefit from the digital age as unmanned and remotely operated production platforms substantially reduce costs and improve operational safety. The International Energy Agency estimates digital technologies could boost the volume of oil and gas that can be produced by around 5% and reduce costs by 10% to 20%. Many in the oil-and gas-industry believe that the potential impact of digitalization is substantially bigger. Morgan Stanley sees digital technologies delivering cost declines not seen since the industry’s Golden Decade from 1987 to 1997. Realizing the full potential of digitalization requires new frameworks for collecting, analyzing, and sharing vast amounts of sensitive and proprietary data. Moreover, leveraging digital technologies in the oilfield will require addressing fears about the protection of data from competitors or even foreign governments. Driving down costs through AI means more supply at lower prices, firming the role of the U.S. among the world’s largest producers and continuing to challenge the ability of OPEC and Russia to prop up prices. Yet it also means that technological innovation alone is not sufficient to achieve a clean energy transition. There is nothing inherently green about digital innovation. If new digital tools are to help us address the serious threat of climate change, supporting policy will be necessary that puts a price on carbon or otherwise forces us all to account for the social harms that are caused by our current patterns of energy consumption.
The abundance of small arms-based initiatives and programs since the mid-1990s has not eliminated the problems caused by uncontrolled small arms proliferation and misuse. On the contrary, small arms continue to contribute to devastation around the world. Why have these initiatives failed?
The problem of compelled back doors is extremely difficult. Due to powers provided to the government by the various laws outlined earlier in this article, consumers can never completely trust the companies who make and supply the software that they use to go about their daily business online. Any firm can be compelled to insert a back door into its own product, no matter how committed it is to protecting the privacy of its customers. The simplest solution to this problem would be to amend the law to prohibit this coercive behavior by government agencies. However, given the realities of Washington DC, and the fear of being accused of being soft on terrorism or child pornography, it is unlikely that Congress would agree to any form of legislative fix which took away this power. Thus, we focus our attention upon non-legislative solutions to this issue.
"As Congress works to responsibly reduce our deficit, we need to continue to maintain important investments in areas critical to economic growth, like renewable energy, manufacturing and job training programs," said Congressman Carney. "Offshore wind power is a rapidly growing industry around the world. By incentivizing companies to develop offshore wind operations in the United States, we will reduce our dependency on foreign oil, while creating good-paying manufacturing jobs right here in Delaware. I look forward to working with my Democratic and Republican co-sponsors in both the House and Senate to pass this important piece of legislation."
When Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko visits Washington on Thursday, he will almost certainly again ask for U.S. military assistance, including defensive weapons. President Barack Obama should say yes. Arming Kiev can deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from further aggression and support the fragile Ukraine ceasefire and settlement process. Doing so would also bolster U.S. efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. Russia illegally occupied and annexed Crimea in March. Just weeks later, armed separatists — assisted and, in some cases, led by Russian intelligence officers — began seizing government buildings in the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukrainian counterattacks started making headway in the summer. Russia responded by supplying heavy weapons to the separatists — including, it is widely believed, the Buk anti-aircraft system believed to have shot down Malaysia Airlines flight 17 in mid-July. Despite the influx of arms, Ukrainian forces continued to make progress. By early August, the separatists looked on the verge of defeat. That would have stopped Putin’s strategy in its tracks. So, as NATO noted, elite Russian military units invaded and occupied Ukrainian territory, hitting Ukrainian forces hard. Vastly outgunned, Poroshenko had little choice but to accept a ceasefire on September 5. The truce is shaky, but the Ukrainian president seems intent on pursuing a peaceful settlement. Whether common ground can be found among Kiev, the separatists and Moscow is unclear. At best, the negotiation will be long and arduous. The Ukrainian government has for some time sought lethal military assistance, such as anti-armor weapons, as well as secure communications equipment and reconnaissance drones. When he hosts Poroshenko in the Oval Office, Obama should agree to provide defensive arms on an expedited basis. Such assistance would enhance Kiev’s ability to deter further Russian aggression, aggression that would threaten, perhaps fatally, the possibility of a negotiated settlement. A better-armed Ukrainian military would give Putin pause, because it could impose greater costs on the Russian army if the Russians break the ceasefire and renew the fighting. Reports detail the extraordinary lengths, such as nighttime burials, to which the Kremlin has gone to hide from its public the fact that Russian soldiers have fought and died in Ukraine. The more costly the Ukrainians can make any fighting for the Russians, the less Moscow’s interest in resuming the conflict. Some may argue that providing lethal military assistance would provoke Putin to escalate. But he has already escalated the situation — from instigating separatist actions to providing heavy weapons to sending in the Russian army. This suggests the opposite may well prove true: Arming Ukraine will raise the costs of escalation to Russia and thus make it less likely. Putin has made clear his contempt for the Western response to date. Inaction could embolden him to escalate in Ukraine and test the waters elsewhere, perhaps in a NATO member state such as Estonia. Moreover, the Ukrainians will bear the risks and brunt of any escalation. If they are willing to accept those risks, we should give them the tools to defend themselves. And there is an additional important reason to respond favorably to Ukraine’s request for defensive arms: to restore credibility to the notion of security assurances. In December 1994, the leaders of the United States, Britain and Russia signed the Budapest memorandum on security assurances, which committed those countries to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and not use force against Ukraine. Those commitments paved the way for Kiev’s decision to give up about 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads, at the time the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal. Moscow has grossly violated the Budapest memorandum by its seizure of Crimea and assaults on Ukraine. The United States and Britain have an obligation to respond. Washington has imposed economic sanctions on Russia and provided Ukraine a modest amount of nonlethal military aid. Those are appropriate steps, but they do not suffice. Last Friday, former President Leonid Kuchma, who signed the Budapest memorandum for Ukraine, suggested his country had been cheated. That reflects general sentiment in Kiev.The widely held impression that Moscow has violated its Budapest commitments at low cost badly weakens the value of security assurances in the future. That is unfortunate, as security assurances could play a role as part of the package to resolve the Iran and North Korea nuclear issues. But how much value will security assurances have if Tehran and Pyongyang see that they can be violated with relative impunity?
In his public discourse, Obama provided another archetype of the exemplary immigrant, the military service member, who, in contrast to the entrepreneur, provided a different model for neoliberal responsibility and self-management. In his 2010 speech, for example, the president talked about Perla Ramos, an immigrant “born and raised in Mexico, [who] came to the United States shortly after 9/11, and eventually joined the Navy” (para. 7). Obama (2011) also talked about “a young man named Granger Michael from Papua New Guinea, a Marine who deployed to Iraq three times. Here’s what he said about becoming an American citizen. ‘I might as well. I love this country already’” (para. 7). Obama (2013a) praised Alan Aleman, one of the first to receive a stay of deportation through the DACA program because he had “emerge[d] from the shadows” and was “studying to become a doctor” and “hope[d] to join the Air Force” (para. 46–47). In addition to these specific references, Obama (2012a) also regularly invoked the military service member as an example of an ideal, responsible, and desirable immigrant, stating, “I’ve got a young person who is serving in our military, protecting us and our freedom. The notion that in some ways we would treat them as expendable makes no sense” (para. 29; cf. Obama, 2012b). Obama’s logic here was a welcome check to those who would argue that the rule of law trumps all other humanitarian considerations. Instead, Obama celebrated immigrants’ contributions to the nation and argued that concern for immigrants’ welfare and attention to their expression of cultural citizenship should factor into decisions about immigration enforcement. However, these stories, like those of economic entrepreneurs, also helped to establish the difference between ideal and nonideal immigrants by representing another type of responsible self-management, the highest expression of which was national service. Previous presidents also made explicit reference to immigrant service members in their speeches (see Amaya, 2007; Beasley, 2004; Edwards & Herder, 2012). However, Obama’s stories were unique because they helped to define the neoliberal exception as the governing logic of his administration’s approach to immigration and citizenship. The image of the immigrant service member functioned as what Ong (2006) called “exception to neoliberalism” and “neoliberalism as exception” (p. 5). The service member represented one of the few ways to exercise prudential self-management and responsibility outside of the explicit logic of the marketplace—an exception to neoliberal rationality calculated for the sake of national sovereignty. At the same time, this was neoliberalism as exception because immigrants who embodied responsibility in a way that presented a significant social benefit to the nation were the exception to concerns about jobs, protectionism, and economic calculability. Apart from the stories referenced above, the emphasis on responsibility as a neoliberal exception can also be seen governing immigration policies such as the DREAM Act, DACA, and prosecutorial discretion. These policies rely heavily on the dichotomy between responsible/good immigrants versus irresponsible/criminal/bad immigrants, the former who are exceptions to concerns about national sovereignty and the rule of law and the latter who are excepted from promises of neoliberal mobility and individualism. For example, the administration’s prosecutorial discretion policy was touted as part of an approach to targeting and deporting “criminal” immigrants, and the DACA and DREAM Act both work on the idea that certain immigrants should be exempted from deportation because of their embrace of neoliberal responsibility (Gonzales, 2010; Nevins, 2012). Obama (2010) also tied comprehensive immigration reform to neoliberal values, arguing that “we should make it easier for the best and brightest to come to start a business and develop products and create jobs” (para. 38), and that undocumented immigrants “earn their way to citizenship” by paying taxes, learning English, and “going to the back of the line” (Obama, 2013a, para. 30). Again that Obama drew distinctions between desirable and undesirable immigrants should not be surprising, since it is an inherent thread of presidential immigration discourse and policy; the important point to emphasize here is the way in which these distinctions contributed to and participated in a cultural moment of neoliberal racialization. The trope of responsibility, like that of entrepreneurialism discussed previously, was indexed to neoliberal forms of whiteness (Garner, 2012). Obama (2011) told the story of engineer and NASA astronaut José Hernández, who encapsulated the figure of entrepreneur and national serviceman. Hernández was born in California, “though he could have just as easily been born on the other side of the border, had it been a different time of year, because his family” of migrant farm workers “moved with the seasons. Two of his siblings were actually born in Mexico” (para. 41). Despite the place of his birth and the educational and economic challenges he faced, Hernández kept studying, and graduated high school. He kept studying, earning an engineering degree and a graduate degree. He kept working hard, ending up at a national laboratory. … And a few years later, he found himself more than 100 miles above the surface of the earth, staring out the window of the Shuttle Discovery, remembering the boy in the California fields with a crazy dream and an unshakable belief that everything was possible in America. … That’s the American Dream right there. That’s what we’re fighting for. We are fighting for every boy and every girl like José with a dream and potential that’s just waiting to be tapped. (para. 45–47) Neoliberal values of individual responsibility and entrepreneurialism provided the exception to nation-state logics of citizenship and belonging for Hernández, for though he was born as a U.S. citizen, Hernández’s real inclusion into the American community came through his faith and success in achieving the American Dream (as an entrepreneur and through his national service). The racialized image of the migrant farmworker performing stoop labor in the hot sun was transformed into the engineer, entrepreneur, and astronaut through embrace of the American Dream and neoliberal values of hard work, responsibility, and service. Hernández’s embodiment of neoliberal subjectivity and a moral economy of whiteness helped to insure his belonging more than did his actual legal status as citizen. On the contrary, Hernández’s siblings had been born on the other side of the border, a clarification that highlighted the exceptions to entrepreneurialism that turned on national sovereignty. Racialization also took shape through the administration’s rhetoric of criminalization. Criminal immigrants embodied an excess/absence of neoliberal characteristics because they worked too hard for too little, they stole jobs from other citizens, and they crossed borders and went outside of the law for economic benefit. These undocumented immigrants were too entrepreneurial (or not enough), too individual (or not enough), or too monocultural. This meant they did not really believe in the nation’s precepts and/or that they threatened its sovereignty and economy, making them the target of police surveillance, prosecution, or deportation. This dichotomy between exemplary and “criminal” immigrants points to what Lisa Marie Cacho (2012) termed the “dilemma” of social value: the fact that the social value of one marginalized group is often constructed through the “social death” of “an/other, and that other is almost always poor, racialized, criminalized, segregated, legally vulnerable, and unprotected” (p. 17). These populations “are excluded from law’s protection, [but] they are not excluded from law’s discipline, punishment, and regulation” (p. 5). While certain undocumented immigrants, such as the DREAMers or immigrant service members, were recuperated and given social value, the method of doing so revolved around the denial of value to other racialized archetypes of immigrants, such as the unskilled worker, the criminal border crosser, or the irresponsible immigrant become a public charge. So pervasive are these racialized forms of demanding social value that they are found in the discourse of some immigrant activists, who through their efforts to assert their social worth normalize certain forms of socioeconomic class and education as markers of the “model” citizen (Anguiano & Chávez, 2011). This discourse granted social value to certain immigrants who embraced responsibility and entrepreneurialism while contributing to the social death of criminalized and racialized populations.
The aim of the following paper is to turn attention of the reader to an economic sector – the maritime sector –, which seems to be very interesting for explaining national compliance with international norms. I would like to mention, that a comprehensive analysis of the below described international regimes in the context of compliance is not possible in a small working paper like this. Therefore, the paper only highlights the most important structures related to this context and develops some arguments for discussion. The two IMO-Conventions (IMO = International Maritime Organisation) Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping Convention 95 (STCW 95), as an extensive revision of the STCW 78 Convention and International Safety Management Code (ISM), which are substantial amendments to the Safety Of Life At Sea Convention (SOLAS), provide examples for positive market-correcting international regulation, although the economic efficiency of the involved states varies strongly.
“It is becoming clear that the post-9/11 surveillance apparatus may be at cross-purposes with our high-tech economic growth,” declared Third Way’s Mieke Eoyang and Gabriel Horowitz in December 2013. “The economic consequences [of the recent revelations] could be staggering.”25 A TIME magazine headline projected that “NSA Spying Could Cost U.S. Tech Giants Billions,” predicting losses based on the increased scrutiny that economic titans like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Yahoo have faced both at home and abroad since last June.26 The NSA’s actions pose a serious threat to the current value and future stability of the information technology industry, which has been a key driver of economic growth and productivity in the United States in the past decade.27 In this section, we examine how emerging evidence about the NSA’s extensive surveillance apparatus has already hurt and will likely continue to hurt the American tech sector in a number of ways, from dwindling U.S. market share in industries like cloud computing and webhosting to dropping tech sales overseas. The impact of individual users turning away from American companies in favor of foreign alternatives is a concern. However, the major losses will likely result from diminishing confidence in U.S. companies as trustworthy choices for foreign government procurement of products and services and changing behavior in the business-to-business market. Trust in American businesses has taken a significant hit since the initial reports on the PRISM program suggested that the NSA was directly tapping into the servers of nine U.S. companies to obtain customer data for national security investigations.28 The Washington Post’s original story on the program provoked an uproar in the media and prompted the CEOs of several major companies to deny knowledge of or participation in the program.29 The exact nature of the requests made through the PRISM program was later clarified,30 but the public attention on the relationship between American companies and the NSA still created a significant trust gap, especially in industries where users entrust companies to store sensitive personal and commercial data. “Last year’s national security leaks have also had a commercial and financial impact on American technology companies that have provided these records,” noted Representative Bob Goodlatte, a prominent Republican leader and Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, in May 2014. “They have experienced backlash from both American and foreign consumers and have had their competitive standing in the global marketplace damaged.”31 Given heightened concerns about the NSA’s ability to access data stored by U.S. companies, it is no surprise that American companies offering cloud computing and webhosting services are among those experiencing the most acute economic fallout from NSA surveillance. Within just a few weeks of the first disclosures, reports began to emerge that American cloud computing companies like Dropbox and Amazon Web Services were starting to lose business to overseas competitors.32 The CEO of Artmotion, one of Switzerland’s largest offshore hosting providers, reported in July 2013 that his company had seen a 45 percent jump in revenue since the first leaks,33 an early sign that the country’s perceived neutrality and strong data and privacy protections34 could potentially be turned into a serious competitive advantage.35 Foreign companies are clearly poised to benefit from growing fears about the security ramifications of keeping data in the United States. In a survey of 300 British and Canadian businesses released by PEER 1 in January 2014,36 25 percent of respondents indicated that they were moving data outside of the U.S. as a result of the NSA revelations. An overwhelming number of the companies surveyed indicated that security and data privacy were their top concerns, with 81 percent stating that they “want to know exactly where their data is being hosted.” Seventy percent were even willing to sacrifice performance in order to ensure that their data was protected.37 It appears that little consideration was given over the past decade to the potential economic repercussions if the NSA’s secret programs were revealed.38 This failure was acutely demonstrated by the Obama Administration’s initial focus on reassuring the public that its programs primarily affect non-Americans, even though non-Americans are also heavy users of American companies’ products. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg put a fine point on the issue, saying that the government “blew it” in its response to the scandal. He noted sarcastically: “The government response was, ‘Oh don’t worry, we’re not spying on any Americans.’ Oh, wonderful: that’s really helpful to companies [like Facebook] trying to serve people around the world, and that’s really going to inspire confidence in American internet companies.”39 As Zuckerberg’s comments reflect, certain parts of the American technology industry are particularly vulnerable to international backlash since growth is heavily dependent on foreign markets. For example, the U.S. cloud computing industry has grown from an estimated $46 billion in 2008 to $150 billion in 2014, with nearly 50 percent of worldwide cloud-computing revenues coming from the U.S.40 R Street Institute’s January 2014 policy study concluded that in the next few years, new products and services that rely on cloud computing will become increasingly pervasive. “Cloud computing is also the root of development for the emerging generation of Web-based applications—home security, outpatient care, mobile payment, distance learning, efficient energy use and driverless cars,” writes R Street’s Steven Titch in the study. “And it is a research area where the United States is an undisputed leader.”41 This trajectory may be dramatically altered, however, as a consequence of the NSA’s surveillance programs. Economic forecasts after the Snowden leaks have predicted significant, ongoing losses for the cloud-computing industry in the next few years. An August 2013 study by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) estimated that revelations about the NSA’s PRISM program could cost the American cloud computing industry $22 to $35 billion over the next three years.42 On the low end, the ITIF projection suggests that U.S. cloud computing providers would lose 10 percent of the foreign market share to European or Asian competitors, totaling in about $21.5 billion in losses; on the high-end, the $35 billion figure represents about 20 percent of the companies’ foreign market share. Because the cloud computing industry is undergoing rapid growth right now—a 2012 Gartner study predicted global spending on cloud computing would increase by 100 percent from 2012 to 2016, compared to a 3 percent overall growth rate in the tech industry as a whole43—vendors in this sector are particularly vulnerable to shifts in the market. Failing to recruit new customers or losing a competitive advantage due to exploitation by rival companies in other countries can quickly lead to a dwindling market share. The ITIF study further notes that “the percentage lost to foreign competitors could go higher if foreign governments enact protectionist trade barriers that effectively cut out U.S. providers,” citing early calls from German data protection authorities to suspend the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor program (which will be discussed at length in the next section).44 As the R Street Policy Study highlights, “Ironically, the NSA turned the competitive edge U.S. companies have in cloud computing into a liability, especially in Europe.”4 Research analyst James Staten argued that the think tank’s estimates were low, suggesting that the actual figure could be as high as $180 billion over three years.46 Staten highlighted two additional impacts not considered in the ITIF study. The first is that U.S. customers—not just foreign companies—would also avoid US cloud providers, especially for international and overseas business. The ITIF study predicted that American companies would retain their domestic market share, but Staten argued that the economic blowback from the revelations would be felt at home, too. “You don’t have to be a French company, for example, to be worried about the US government snooping in the data about your French clients,” he wrote.47 Moreover, the analysis highlighted a second and “far more costly” impact: that foreign cloud providers, too, would lose as much as 20 percent of overseas and domestic business because of similar spying programs conducted by other governments. Indeed, the NSA disclosures “have prompted a fundamental re-examination of the role of intelligence services in conducting coordinated cross-border surveillance,” according to a November 2013 report by Privacy International on the “Five Eyes” intelligence partnership between the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.48 Staten predicts that as the surveillance landscape around the world becomes more clear, it could have a serious negative impact on all hosting and outsourcing services, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the overall IT services market, or about $180 billion in losses.49 Recent reports suggest that things are, in fact, moving in the direction that analysts like Castro and Staten suggested.50 A survey of 1,000 “[Information and Communications Technology (ICT)] decision-makers” from France, Germany, Hong Kong, the UK, and the USA in February and March 2014 found that the disclosures “have had a direct impact on how companies around the world think about ICT and cloud computing in particular.”51 According to the data from NTT Communications, 88 percent of decision-makers are changing their purchasing behavior when it comes to the cloud, with the vast majority indicating that the location of the data is very important. The results do not bode well for recruitment of new customers, either—62 percent of those currently not storing data in the cloud indicated that the revelations have since prevented them from moving their ICT systems there. And finally, 82 percent suggested that they agree with proposals made by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February 2014 to have separate data networks for Europe, which will be discussed in further detail in Part III of this report. Providing direct evidence of this trend, Servint, a Virginia-based webhosting company, reported in June 2014 that international clients have declined by as much as half, dropping from approximately 60 percent of its business to 30 percent since the leaks began.52 With faith in U.S. companies on the decline, foreign companies are stepping in to take advantage of shifting public perceptions. As Georg Mascolo and Ben Scott predicted in a joint paper published by the Wilson Center and the New America Foundation in October 2013, “Major commercial actors on both continents are preparing offensive and defensive strategies to battle in the market for a competitive advantage drawn from Snowden’s revelations.”53 For example, Runbox, a small Norwegian company that offers secure email service, reported a 34 percent jump in customers since June 2013.54 Runbox markets itself as a safer email and webhosting provider for both individual and commercial customers, promising that it “will never disclose any user data unauthorized, track your usage, or display any advertisements.”55 Since the NSA revelations, the company has touted its privacy-centric design and the fact that its servers are located in Norway as a competitive advantage. “Being firmly located in Norway, the Runbox email service is governed by strict privacy regulations and is a safe alternative to American email services as well as cloud-based services that move data across borders and jurisdictions,” company representatives wrote on its blog in early 2014.56 F-Secure, a Finnish cloud storage company, similarly emphasizes the fact that “its roots [are] in Finland, where privacy is a fiercely guarded value.”57 Presenting products and services as ‘NSA-proof’ or ‘safer’ alternatives to American-made goods is an increasingly viable strategy for foreign companies hoping to chip away at U.S. tech competiveness.58
While drone surveillance in the United States would undoubtedly prove controversial, the use of drones is currently a topic of international concern. Some Democrats have said the use of drones to disrupt terrorist networks is hurting America's image overseas. Additionally, the United Nations is considering an investigation into drone airstrikes inside Pakistan, which could focus on the rate of civilian casualties caused by these attacks. Congress has ordered the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to move toward allowing drones to fly alongside commercial aircraft in U.S. airspace by 2015. The FAA is planning a pilot program to test fly drones in six locations, but will not set the rules for what the unmanned aircraft can be used for. Law enforcement agencies and state and local governments have expressed a strong interest in unmanned aircraft, and are being courted as potential customers by the booming drone industry. There is opposition, however, from groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) that have raised concerns about the impact of the drones on privacy.
In the not too distant future, scientists predict the Arctic Ocean will be largely sea ice free in summer - but pinpointing when is more difficult. But does it matter if it happens sooner rather than later? Here are five reasons why it might. ¶ Arctic sea ice is declining rapidly, with the seasonal low in summer shrinking particularly quickly. Scientists have different ways to predict Arctic sea ice decline. If melting continues as it has in recent years, it could be as soon as 2020, but climate models suggest it won't happen until 2040 or later. So far, it's not clear which is more likely - see here for more.¶ But why does it matter how quickly it happens?¶ 1. Loss of ice means more heat is absorbed¶ Albedo is a measure of how well the earth's surface reflects sunlight. Snow-covered sea ice has a high albedo and reflects 85 per cent of sunlight. But the open water revealed as ice melts is darker and absorbs more - reflecting just seven per cent. The less sunlight is reflected, the more heat the planet absorbs.¶ Professor Jennifer Francis from Rutgers University explained recently that losing reflective sea ice can, in turn, speed up surface warming - what's known as a positive feedback. She says:¶ "As sea ice retreats, sunshine that would have been reflected back to space by the bright ice is instead absorbed by the ocean, which heats up, melting even more ice."¶ The heat doesn't only warm the oceans. Francis explains excess heat entering the oceans during summer is later released back into the atmosphere - raising atmospheric temperatures too. It's one important reason why the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet.¶ 2. Melting Greenland ice sheet raises sea levels¶ In fact, the loss of reflective sea ice is part of the reason Arctic temperature has risen three times faster than the global average in recent decades. This effect, known as Arctic amplification, has consequences for nearby land ice, too.¶ As land ice melts, it adds freshwater to the oceans causing sea levels to rise, and surface melt from Greenland is increasing, as the image below shows. Satellite data suggest over the last 20 years, the Greenland ice sheet has lost 140 billion tonnes of ice per year.¶ This has raised sea levels by about 7.8 millimetres - 12 per cent of total sea level rise in that time. The newest climate models project that by 2100, Greenland's ice sheet could contribute four to nine centimetres to sea level. Earlier estimates had put that figure anywhere between one and 12 centimetres.¶ Warmer, sea ice free oceans could also increase melting from Greenland's glaciers. Professor Andrew Shepherd from Leeds University tells us:¶ "[S]mall increases in ocean temperature can quickly destabilise glaciers that flow into the oceans, and so we could expect further ice losses due to that effect too."¶ The quicker sea ice loss causes Arctic temperatures to rise, the faster the Greenland ice sheet is likely to melt - and while it isn't going to disappear any time soon, this contributes more to sea level rise.¶ 3. Thawing permafrost amplifies warming¶ Rising Arctic temperatures are thawing once-frozen ground in the Arctic - known as permafrost. Scientists are concerned carbon dioxide and methane released from the carbon-rich permafrost could cause additional warming by adding to greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere - another positive feedback. Frozen methane also exists in methane hydrates in the sea floor.¶ But there is a lot of uncertainty about how much carbon these frozen deposits hold, and how quickly they are thawing. So far, only a small amount of methane in the atmosphere can be traced to thawing permafrost. Most results from human activity, like agriculture and landfill, with a smaller amount released naturally from wetlands.¶ At the moment, warming is mainly driven by carbon dioxide emissions. But the sooner sea ice loss causes land and ocean to warm in the Arctic, the sooner methane from thawing permafrost could start contributing more to warming.¶ 4. Ocean circulations could change¶ Another impact of Arctic and Greenland ice melt could be that the freshwater runoff into the ocean disrupts part of a major circulation system known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation ( AMOC). The AMOC carries warm surface water northward, giving Europe its mild climate.¶ Climate models predict the AMOC could slow down by an average of 25 per cent by 2100. This is mainly due to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, but scientists say freshwater from melting ice could become increasingly important with climate change.¶ Models suggest a slowdown in the AMOC could cool the northern hemisphere this century, but the effect is likely to be outweighed by greenhouse gas warming. But the AMOC is just one part of a giant conveyor belt which currently redistributes warmth around the world, so losing ice could affect regional climates worldwide.¶ Changes in the strength of the AMOC can also affect sea ice melt by transporting more or less warm surface water into the region. So it's a complicated picture and scientists we spoke to said while the rate of Arctic melting will almost certainly affect the AMOC, more research is needed to understand the full extent of the impacts.¶ 5. Melting sea ice can influence winter weather¶ As temperatures rise faster in the Arctic than at lower latitudes, this changes large-scale temperature and pressure gradients - which has consequences for northern hemisphere winter weather.¶ Professor Charles Greene from Cornell University tells us:¶ "Global warming has increased the loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic, which has altered atmospheric conditions in a manner thatstacks the deck in favor ofmore severe winter outbreaks".¶ The pressure change alters atmospheric circulations, including the jet stream - a stream of fast-flowing air in the atmosphere. It also makes the jet stream's path meander more, which allows cold Arctic air to reach further south, affecting the climate in the mid-latitudes.¶ Scientists are just beginning to understand the effect quicker Arctic sea ice melt could have on northern hemisphere climate. While it's difficult to attribute any particular event to effects of the changing Arctic, professor Francis tells us:¶ "If the summer ice covers disappears sooner than climate models project, I would expect to see Arctic amplification intensify sooner, and the effects on the large-scale circulation would become more conspicuous."¶ Global effects¶ Melting sea ice is likely to have global consequences by unlocking new shipping routes and exposing more fossil fuel reserves. But it's clear that although Arctic sea ice only covers a small fraction of the earth's surface, there may well be serious climate-related impacts too.¶ And it doesn't stop with the climate. The loss of sea ice will also have consequences for people and ecosystems in the Arctic region. As Dr Stephen Vavrus from the Centre for Climatic Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison puts it:¶ "[T]he longer we can delay the loss of sea ice cover, the longer we should be able to keep these consequences at bay".
Twelve months ago, the President laid out an exceptional challenge for the federal government: to develop a framework of best practices and standards to help the critical infrastructure sector improve its cybersecurity, while protecting privacy and civil liberties, based on the thinking of the best minds in industry, academia, and advocacy groups.¶ Twelve months may seem like a long time, but for an issue as complex as cybersecurity that touches, well, everybody, this was an extraordinary goal. But there was no question that we had to rise to this challenge, because near-term action was critical to shoring up our collective defenses against increasing cyber-based threats to our critical infrastructure, our economy, our personal information, and indeed the way we operate on the internet every day. And we have had continued reminders of the urgent need to increase our cyber protections over the course of the past year, as news reports of data breaches and denial of service attacks have become more frequent.¶ Well, I’m proud to say that we – collectively – have done it. After a year-long sprint, the Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the finalized version of the first Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity on February 12. And we are seeing very positive responses just a week after the release. Businesses, state government, advocacy groups, and even foreign partners have come out to support the Framework and recognize the importance of this initial step on the road to improved cybersecurity. Companies have begun to use the framework to aid in communication with their Boards and C-suites and have told us that it can provide a valuable tool to communicate security requirements with their supply chain. And we are gratified that others are enthusiastic as well.¶ I’m not going to go into too many details of what’s in the Framework; you can read about that on NIST’s website and you can read about our program to support voluntary adoption on DHS’s website. And of course, you can read the President’s statement about the Cybersecurity Framework, and the White House press release to find out more.¶ Instead, what I want to emphasize here are four key points:¶ The Framework is exactly that – a framework. It provides a common language and systematic methodology for managing cyber risk. It does not tell a company how much cyber risk is tolerable, nor does it claim to provide “the one and only” formula for cybersecurity. No single document could try to do that and be useful across all 16 critical infrastructure sectors, all sizes and types of organizations, and all in operating environments. But we should not underestimate the power of a common lexicon to enable action across a very diverse set of stakeholders. That’s what will enable the best practices of elite companies to become the standard practices for everyone.¶ The Framework is a first step. Although we have released the first version, we expect more in the future as our cybersecurity improves. The Framework is intended to be a living document that the stakeholder community updates over time as we learn from implementation, and as technology and risks change. That’s another reason why the Framework focuses on the questions an organization needs to ask to manage its cyber risk. The practices, technology, and standards will change over time – the questions won’t.¶ We are encouraging voluntary adoption of the Framework. The Framework is a flexible, highly adaptable document, and its adoption will be market-driven. As a nation, we need to improve cyber protections across the broadest set of stakeholders possible to achieve the collective benefit of security for all. The fastest way to do this is through relentlessly encouraging, helping and, where possible, incentivizing, voluntary adoption.¶ This is a strong public-private partnership. Cyber is a team sport, and we need everyone on the field playing their part. In fact, no single organization or sector or group can solve these challenges. The open and collaborative process that we used to develop the Framework represents a good, repeatable process for developing public policy on complex, pervasive technical issues.¶ As with all things involving security, we will never be “done” working to make improvements. But there are some key next steps where DHS and NIST need your help:¶ We need you to kick the tires. We need organizations to begin using the Framework and see how well it can work for different sizes and types of organizations.
An alternative chain of logic in the psychological literature focuses on leaders’ reactions to crises. These arguments suggest that, in situations of internal political vulnerability, leaders may suffer from motivated bias, leading them to see the enemy as they wish to see them, typically weaker and making an easier target than would be expected given a “rational” evaluation of the situation (Jervis 1976; Lebow 1981). Expectations about the escalation of conflict tinder these conditions are less than clear, however. Following the diversionary argument from a rationalist unitary actor perspective, states engaged in actions to shore up their domestic political situation may not want to pay the costs of a long-running conflict or war, and so we should see less escalation beyond low-level disputes. However, if challenged by another state, leaders facing intense internal political dissent may he likely to force a confrontation initially in order to gain needed, and expected, domestic political benefits by standing tough against an external foe. Similarly, if such a state faces a challenge over some outstanding issue, there is no guarantee that it will be more willing to give in to the challenger compared to rimes when the government is in a position of domestic political strength. Following the motivated bias argument, we might expect more or faster conflict escalation as a leader blindly pushes ahead in his or her dispute with an opposing state.
Every harsh move the Trump administration makes on the southwestern border is designed to deter Central Americans from traveling to the United States. It blocks them at legal ports of entry, holds others in indefinite detention, and has drastically restricted who can even ask for asylum. But there is no evidence that the flow of migrants is slowing in response, nor are these people going home. Turned-back migrants are piling up in privately operated shelters and makeshift camps in Mexican border cities. Will they be allowed to stay, at least, in Mexico? Some wait in hope that U.S. authorities will still grant them a "credible fear" interview to determine if they can even ask for asylum. But that's increasingly unlikely. Last month, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions ruled that U.S. asylum law does not offer protection to those affected by domestic abuse, gang crimes or drug-traffic-related violence. Only "public" violence -- that is, being victimized directly by your government -- qualifies a person to ask for asylum, according to the attorney general. This radical reinterpretation excludes, by some lawyers' estimates, more than 85% of transit migrants -- those who have crossed Mexico from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to get to the southwestern U.S. border. The Trump administration characterizes these transit migrants as disguised economic refugees, but it is impossible to disentangle their economic from their personal safety concerns. Recent field interviews suggest that most are driven to leave by a combination of factors, including gang-related violence and lack of economic opportunities. Some have been personally threatened by gangs; others have relatives who have been harmed; still others, like small business owners, have been targets of gang extortion. Either way, they perceived the risks involved in crossing Mexico to get into the United States as lower than the evident dangers of staying home. For now, they are bottled up within Mexico. So what will Mexico do?
The challenge for President Obama’s speech is the challenge of his second term: how to be great when the environment stinks. Enhancing the president’s legacy requires something more than simply the clever application of predictable stratagems. Washington’s partisan rancor, the size of the problems facing government, and the limited amount of time before Obama is a lame duck all point to a single conclusion: The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat.¶ President Obama could, of course, resign himself to tending to the achievements of his first term. He'd make sure health care reform is implemented, nurse the economy back to health, and put the military on a new footing after two wars. But he's more ambitious than that. He ran for president as a one-term senator with no executive experience. In his first term, he pushed for the biggest overhaul of health care possible because, as he told his aides, he wanted to make history. He may already have made it. There's no question that he is already a president of consequence. But there's no sign he's content to ride out the second half of the game in the Barcalounger. He is approaching gun control, climate change, and immigration with wide and excited eyes. He's not going for caretaker.¶ How should the president proceed then, if he wants to be bold? The Barack Obama of the first administration might have approached the task by finding some Republicans to deal with and then start agreeing to some of their demands in hope that he would win some of their votes. It's the traditional approach. Perhaps he could add a good deal more schmoozing with lawmakers, too. ¶ That's the old way. He has abandoned that. He doesn't think it will work and he doesn't have the time. As Obama explained in his last press conference, he thinks the Republicans are dead set on opposing him. They cannot be unchained by schmoozing. Even if Obama were wrong about Republican intransigence, other constraints will limit the chance for cooperation. Republican lawmakers worried about primary challenges in 2014 are not going to be willing partners. He probably has at most 18 months before people start dropping the lame-duck label in close proximity to his name. ¶ Obama’s only remaining option is to pulverize. Whether he succeeds in passing legislation or not, given his ambitions, his goal should be to delegitimize his opponents. Through a series of clarifying fights over controversial issues, he can force Republicans to either side with their coalition's most extreme elements or cause a rift in the party that will leave it, at least temporarily, in disarray. ¶ This theory of political transformation rests on the weaponization (and slight bastardization) of the work by Yale political scientist Stephen Skowronek. Skowronek has written extensively about what distinguishes transformational presidents from caretaker presidents. In order for a president to be transformational, the old order has to fall as the orthodoxies that kept it in power exhaust themselves. Obama's gambit in 2009 was to build a new post-partisan consensus. That didn't work, but by exploiting the weaknesses of today’s Republican Party, Obama has an opportunity to hasten the demise of the old order by increasing the political cost of having the GOP coalition defined by Second Amendment absolutists, climate science deniers, supporters of “self-deportation” and the pure no-tax wing.
Poverty is rising again after a sustained period of decline since 1997. In 2006, 43 percent of the population was living below the poverty line, according to the state National Council for Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL). It is still too early to say exactly how much poverty will increase, but it could be by around 10 percentage points, Susan Parker, a researcher at the Centre for Economics Research and Teaching (CIDE) and the author of several studies on Mexican social programmes, told IPS. Precise figures will be available in August or September, when CONEVAL publishes its biennial statistics in this country of over 107 million people. In the first quarter of the year, GDP shrank by 8.2 percent compared to the same period in 2008 – the sharpest decline since 1995. This was the third consecutive quarter of economic contraction, the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) announced Wednesday. Furthermore, employment figures have plummeted, industrial and tourism activity have fallen, exports have dropped, and tax revenues have shrunk, which the authorities say will cause a two percent deficit in state finances this year. The government of conservative President Felipe Calderón forecasts net GDP loss of 5.5 percent for 2009, less than the 6.2 percent contraction seen in 1995. Analysts predict that figures for economic activity will continue to be negative in 2010. The Mexican economy is one of the hardest hit in the world because of its close trade links with the United States, the origin of the current global crisis. The outbreak of swine flu that began in April in Mexico further exacerbated the economic problems. The economic crisis and its predictable social impact raise questions about whether Mexico will be able to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), targets set in 2000 by the international community to cut poverty, inequality and pollution, by the 2015 deadline. It is still hard to say how far behind Mexico will fall in meeting the MDGs, said Parker, who holds a doctorate in economics from Yale University, in the United States. There are indications that Mexico will not reach some of the goals.
If private confession is good for the individual's soul, societal confession is equally important to the redemption of the polity's soul and equally vital to achieving any semblance of a Beloved Community. Confession is the acknowledgment that legal and moral wrongs have been done and social sins committed. These sins have alienated us from each other through social constructions of race that encourage and condone a legion of subordinating and dehumanizing practices of domination. In this fall from grace, the path back to wholeness is not always easy. It requires courage to admit shortcomings, a collective humility that has not often been a celebrated quality of the American identity. We have, more so than not, chosen the path of denial and silence, a path made inviting by the rhetoric of inalienable rights, equality under the law, and freedom and justice for all. Even when afforded the opportunity to end the charade, acknowledge the dreadful truth, and make restitution for past mistakes, we have chosen three-fifths compromises, short-lived reconstructions, and anti-affirmative action referenda. At defining moments in our nation's history, we have succumbed to the lower angels of our collective nature and sacrificed black equality upon the altars of political expediency - saving the Union, saving the Party, protecting states' rights, and constructing a trans-ethnic solidarity based on whiteness. n53 America needs its own Truth and Reconciliation Commission, similar to the South African model in which the stories of victims of oppression and the beneficiaries of oppression can be heard. n54 Abstract history must be made personal in order for genuine healing and reconciliation to occur. This mechanism has the potential of personalizing a history that for most Americans seems unrelated to their lives. At the social level, we must acknowledge the ways in which certain social fears like the fears of disunion, competition, retaliation and humiliation have led to the historic atrocities committed against black people in America.
On Tuesday, a Commission representative will appear before the Parliament to lay out their case. People close to the case expect the commission to propose awarding MES, but with mitigations for especially threatened sectors. That proposal will then require approval from parliament. Securing market economy status would benefit China by requiring global trade regulators to compare the price of Chinese exports to its domestic market — instead of higher-priced third countries — in anti-dumping cases and thus limiting their ability to impose tariffs. “China is firmly against any misinterpretation or delay in performance of the clause. We call on members, such as the US and EU, to take necessary measures as soon as possible in order to ensure ending the use of ‘third countries’ before the due time,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said in response to questions from the FT. Mei Xinyu, a researcher at a think-tank affiliated with the Ministry of Commerce, went further. “If the EU doesn’t want to honour the WTO protocol it has signed, it should consider withdrawing its membership. The clause in the protocol is very clear and it’s unconditional.”
South Korea is in no way oblivious to the strategic implications of an increasingly powerful China. There is a lively ongoing debate within Korean strategic circles reflecting this inescapable reality. The ROK calculates that vesting China in an ever larger and increasingly diversified set of relations, beginning with trade and investment but extending to the full spectrum of political and strategic concerns, is the most prudent and productive path that it can follow. But it is premised on an undiminished alliance with the United States, without which Seoul would be unable to interact with China in full confidence. Not unlike US China policy, the viability of Korea’s strategy depends on China’s longer term political, economic, and security evolution. For Seoul, its geographic proximity to China and its modest size relative to its much larger neighbor defines the essential requirements of national strategy. China will always be South Korea’s near neighbor in a divided peninsula and, it will be its direct neighbor following unification. The operative tests for it are thus twofold: will China accord Korea full status as a major middle power, and can the ROK successfully impart to Beijing that its core national interests are not negotiable? These issues underlie the ongoing dynamics in relations between both states. Seoul clearly understands its distinctive “in between” strategic position. A bridging strategy that attaches enduring importance to relations with the United States while enhancing Korea’s strategic identity and interests through closer ties with China seems self-evident. Its leaders have concluded that the congruence of interests between South Korea and China far outweighs the risks. Support for the relationship, though not unambiguous within South Korea, is broadly held across the political divide. The warier voices (also expressed by American and Japanese critics of the ROK’s accommodation with China) fear that Seoul is on a slippery slope that will ultimately envelop Korea in a China-centered political and economic order that will undermine America’s parallel alliance arrangements in Northeast Asia. The ROK discounts these concerns and rejects the zero sum argument that it must make a choice between China and the United States. The continued enhancement of Chinese-Korean relations has been at no discernible cost to the US-ROK alliance, which has rarely if ever seemed closer than at present. Claims that China’s larger goal is to degrade Seoul’s alliance with Washington have no validity so long as Korea’s leaders unambiguously convey to Beijing that its first order strategic interests are not negotiable. The Chinese, for example, have expressed clear objections to continued US-ROK military exercises on the peninsula and to pending possibilities of enhanced US missile defense deployments there. There is every reason to conclude that the ROK will determine its interests and preferences in both areas and (should Beijing raise objections) fully defend its policy decisions, which are not directed at China. Korea’s relations with Japan necessarily represent a more complex case. China and South Korea have both put forward heated objections to the policies of the Abe administration, in particular the prime minister’s equivocal stance on Japan’s earlier acknowledgments of its wartime conduct and his advocacy of collective self-defense and an expansion of Japan’s security role. Japan was conspicuous by its absence from the PRC-ROK Joint Statement issued during Xi’s state visit, which focused exclusively on the enhancement and institutionalization of bilateral relations. However, in his speech at Seoul National University, Xi made extended reference to shared historical antipathies toward Japan, thereby seeking to establish common cause with Seoul. Xi’s open effort to exploit Korea’s shared objections to present-day Japanese policy (no matter how deeply felt these sentiments may be in both countries) seemed jarringly out of place. South Korea, thus, faces the need to define its interests and shape its policies, mindful of its ample and growing stake in long-term relations with China, while remaining able to define its own course apart from overt Chinese pressure. There is a profound difference between close links to China and being overly enveloped in Beijing’s strategies, without full attentiveness to Korea’s interests and needs. Success in realizing these multiple goals will be the ultimate test of the viability of a bridging strategy, on which Korea’s security and well-being clearly depend.
But protecting traditional race categories and race-based rights and at the same time allowing for a radical rethinking of identity does not come without costs. One cost may be the very thing the traditional civil rights groups feared most from a single multiracial category: movement of more minorities away from a single racial identity and potentially toward white- ness. Of course this is not just the result of individual choice, but occurs through the reclassification of bodies based on changes to the categories. In discussing the oft-cited projections that the United States will be a minority- majority country by 2060 based on current immigration trends, john powell notes that he is skeptical "that we will categorize those immigrants such that the majority is non-white. When we talk about changing demographics we must remember that we are in control of how we categorize our popula-tion. Racial ordering is not a natural phenomenon." If history is any in-   dication, enough people will be allowed to claim whiteness that the country can maintain a white majority, with its attendant white power and privilege, and the nation as currently imagined can be preserved. There is already a good deal of flexibility in the white category even as it is currently defined, as a person "having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa," '64 and there is reason to expect this definition will continue to change with time. Even if it does not, racial performance will undoubtedly continue to inform our legal definitions.365 Immigrants, much like they did one hundred years ago, are changing the meaning of whiteness. There were 28 million foreign-born residents of the U.S. in 2000; two-thirds reported that they were white. 66 Not only are American race categories somewhat meaningless to many immigrants, but to the ex- tent they have meaning it is abundantly clear that immigrants "equate 3'67 whiteness with opportunity and inclusion." Furthermore, the His- panic/Latino category, an already ambiguous ethnicity, is another possible gateway to whiteness. In 2000, nearly half of all Hispanics classified them- selves as white. 68 But of course, the OMB did not undo the basic race categories nor did it create a separate multiracial category. Hence, another important cost in its final decision is to those who understand themselves as multiracial and who feel that they exist in liminal spaces on official forms, in the national imagination, and in communities and even families. This nonrecognition is acknowledged and perhaps exacerbated by the Census Bureau when it re- 3'69 fers to multiracial people as "The Two or More Races Population." By not fundamentally changing the categories by which we understand and struggle with race, the check-all-that-apply decision continues to discipline and discount those who do not fit within them.
Politicians are addicted to crime. Democrats, Republicans, liberals and conservatives are all addicted to crime and the politics of fear. I recently received a fundraising request from a liberal Democrat, a candidate whose positions and career I generally respect. In the request, he accused the incumbent of being "soft on crime." I realize that many of us might agree that it is wrong not to prosecute campaign finance violations — which was the context of the solicitation — but the phrase itself is toxic. It demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the causes and problems of mass incarceration. If a liberal Democrat will use "soft on crime" when he thinks it will motivate voters, there is very little hope we will ever be "smart on crime." "Soft on crime" is one of those simple phrases — such as "truth in sentencing" or "three strikes and you're out" — that so oversimplify complex issues that they suck the life out of people. We see the consequences of "soft on crime" campaigns every time we visit men and women serving sentences without hope in Wisconsin's overcrowded prisons. Any serious candidate should know better. Anyone running for public office should read Michelle Alexander's book, "The New Jim Crow." Alexander details the causes and costs of keeping more than 2 million of our brothers and sisters behind bars and keeping fathers of 2 million children in prison. Alexander explains that mass incarceration results from two explicit public policies: the war on drugs and tough-on-crime laws (such as "truth in sentencing") that have led to more people being put in prison for longer sentences with no chance for parole or time off for good behavior. Accusing an electoral opponent of being "soft on crime" is a powerful weapon. It motivates voters by preying on their fears — sometimes realistic but often inflated — of becoming victims of crime. The "soft on crime" charge often works, but it comes with a terrible cost. Candidates who get elected by being "tough on crime" mortgage their political and moral future and the future of the citizens they claim to serve. Having been elected by calling their opponents "soft on crime," they know the power of the allegation. Once elected, they are compelled to do everything they can to show they will never be "soft on crime." More prisons get built. Sentences get longer. Parole is denied. Pardons are refused. In the end, Wisconsin ends up spending more on prisons than on its world-class university system or on health care, with no justifiable increase in public safety.
On June 5, Secretary of State John Kerry raised eyebrows when he met with his Venezuelan counterpart, Foreign Minister Elías Jaua. Both were in Guatemala to attend the recent General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS). The pair’s meeting was the first high-level public meeting between the two countries since U.S. president Barack Obama and former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez shook hands and had a brief exchange at the fifth Summit of the Americas in 2009. The Venezuelan government requested the meeting, which lasted 40 minutes and was followed by the announcement that the governments would embark on high-level talks aimed at improving bilateral relations. Of particular note, both sides expressed hope that the reciprocal appointment of ambassadors would take place in short order; Chávez expelled the U.S. ambassador in 2008 and the United States retaliated in kind. All of this is complicated by the outcome of the Venezuelan presidential election on April 14. The official results have named Nicolás Maduro the winner, having beaten opposition leader Henrique Capriles by a slim 1.5 percentage points—though the opposition continues to contest both the results and the audit. While much of the region moved quickly to recognize Maduro as the victor, the United States has yet to formally recognize the outcome and is waiting for the results of an audit that is satisfactory to all parties. So, given these developments, should the United States be resetting its relationship with Venezuela? Q1: Where do U.S.-Venezuelan relations stand? A1: Despite many fits and starts to advance relations in recent years, genuine improvements in the relationship have been hard to come by. Various U.S. government agencies hold sanctions against elements of the Venezuelan government, including on state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) for trading with Iran; on a former Iran-Venezuela Bank (IVB) for handling money transfers with a Chinese bank on behalf of the Export Development Bank of Iran (EDBI); and on the state-owned Venezuelan Military Industry Company after it traded with Iran, North Korea, and Syria. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), over the past five years, has also designated more than half a dozen Venezuelan government officials for acting for, or on behalf of, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), designated a narco-terrorist organization by the U.S. agency. And, let’s not forget that the reason there are no ambassadors in Caracas or D.C. was Chávez’s refusal in 2010 to accept Obama’s nominee for the post in Venezuela. Similarly, Venezuela severed ties with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in 2005. On the day Chávez’s death was announced, Maduro, as caretaker, expelled two U.S. air force attachés based in the Caracas embassy, accusing them of espionage. The United States retaliated in kind. The Maduro government also arrested U.S. filmmaker Tim Tracy for allegedly instigating postelection violence, though many pointed out he was simply in Venezuela to film a documentary on politics in the country. (Tracy was released without further explanation the same morning Kerry and Jaua met.) Suggestions by members of the Venezuelan government that the United States may have given Chávez the cancer that caused his death have certainly not helped relations either, neither have repeated accusations targeted at former officials and U.S. military and intelligence involvement in countless evidence-free plots. Given the complex reality of the bilateral relationship, it looks like both sides have a long road ahead of them if they seek to enact positive changes.
Republicans have not been shy in recent years about wanting to cut the safety net to ribbons, slashing programs like food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Medicaid and Medicare and heating assistance and unemployment and basically everything else that keeps struggling families afloat. But now even that eagerness to hurt poor people may not be enough. The far-far-right House Freedom Caucus is taking its own party’s budget hostage to demand more and deeper cuts. They have a long list of ways to keep people from getting the help they need, like making work requirements harder to fulfill—currently an able-bodied adult without dependents has to work about 20 hours a week to be eligible for SNAP and the Freedom Caucus would increase that—among other ways of cutting the safety net out from under people. They have a trade-off in mind: less assistance for poor people in the form of food, more assistance for rich people in the form of giant tax breaks.
However, to my mind the parody found in drag shows only minimally pushes discursive boundaries. Because drag performers are fetishized by audiences and seen by eager kibitzers as a parody of a "true" identity, such performances lose their subversive quality and their transformative possibilities. While the avid queer theorist recognizes the irony in this performance, the onlooker generally will not read this performance as subversive. Drag is viewed as mere imitation by heteronormative society and is generally perceived as a spectacle, a comedic performance consumed by cultural tourists. Therefore, drag, a prime example of subversive mimesis is a limited strategy for sustaining queer heterotopias.
The endless pursuit of economic growth is making us unhappy and risks destroying the Earth’s capacity to sustain us. The good news is that taking steps to make our lives more sustainable will also make us happier and healthier. Would you like a four day weekend – every week? I’ve been to two conferences over the last year with similar basic premises. The first was at the Australian National University on ecological economics and the second, just last week, was on steady state economics at the University of New South Wales. The premise sitting behind both of these conferences is simple and undeniably true yet undermines so much that is fundamental to our current way of life: Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news Read more We live on a finite planet. That’s it. How, you might wonder, can such a simple statement of obvious fact undermine the tenets of modern society? The earth is a giant rock, hurtling through inhospitable space surrounded by a very thin film of life sustaining atmosphere. Earth’s life support systems are self-sustaining and self-regulating. However, we humans are slowly and steadily pulling this life support system to pieces. Our planet is very large and can absorb a lot of tinkering with its systems, but there are now over 7 billion of us and the amount of energy and resources we are each using is growing fast. That’s a lot of tinkering. There’s plenty of evidence that we are pushing up against and exceeding several critical boundaries of global sustainability: by which I don’t mean some tree hugging idea of sustainability, I mean we are taking actions that cannot be supported by the earth’s systems in the long term. We’re already exceeding the earth’s adaptive capacity with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss and the nitrogen cycle and we’re approaching critical limits in both the phosphorous cycle and ocean acidification. Our use of fresh water is also approaching or exceeding sustainable limits in many parts of the world and we’re systematically destroying our arable land. These are critical life sustaining global processes that cannot be ignored without severe consequences. The Living Planet Report illustrates what we know about our impact on global processes. Photograph: living planet report Economists, like the nobel prize winning Paul Krugman, will counter this line of thought by pointing out that, theoretically, we can have endless economic growth because of continuous efficiency increases. If you believe human creativity is endless then you can argue that economic growth can be endless. However, in this case, like in so many, reality clashes violently with economic theory. We are showing no signs of decoupling economic growth from physical resource use. Unless that decoupling starts now and happens in a hurry, continued economic growth will push the planet beyond its capacity to sustain us – on several fronts. You may be surprised to hear that there’s really good news in all this. None of the stuff we’re doing that’s destroying the biosphere is making us happy. By contrast, changing to a more sustainable way of living will also bring us greater happiness and general wellbeing. Seem too good to be true? That’s because we’ve all been so effectively sold the line that endless growth is essential to maintain and improve our quality of life. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Material prosperity has diminishing returns when it comes to happiness and wellbeing. Once we have good access to food, shelter, healthcare and other basic material things, the nature of the community in which you live and the quality of your relationships is the best predictor of wellbeing. More stuff only makes a very marginal difference. Money can’t buy happiness. When rich countries get richer their subjective wellbeing (SWB) doesn’t necessarily rise.

Military incidents and crises are unfortunately becoming more common in US-China relations. Since the mid-1990s, the relationship has witnessed the 1995–96 Taiwan Strait crisis, the 1999 Belgrade bombing incident, the 2001 EP-3 crisis, the 2006 Kitty Hawk incident, the 2007 ASAT test,  and the 2009 Impeccable incident. Since 2010, tensions have intensified on the Korean Peninsula, in the East China Sea, and also in the South China Sea. When the Obama administration took office in 2009, it inherited the policies of the Bush administration, which had sought to subordinate problems in the Asia-Pacific region to the “global war on terrorism.” Although the inevitable focus on the Middle East following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America created an atmosphere of uncertainty in the Asia-Pacific region, the general policy direction on China of encouraging Beijing to become a “responsible stakeholder” is now widely perceived as reasonably successful. The Obama administration’s early policy formulation aiming at “strategic reassurance” appeared to be a worthy successor to Zoellick’s important formulation. Unfortunately, this very promising policy direction has been quite inexplicably dropped like a stone and replaced by the “pivot to the Asia-Pacific,” a formulation later repackaged as a “rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific.” This initiative, which may stand as the most proactive and coherent and consequently the most important foreign policy legacy of the Obama administration, was unveiled in the fall of 2011 in major policy statements by Obama and Secretary Clinton, and has diplomatic, informational, economic, and military components. In its most ideal form, the strategy is most concentrated on the nonmilitary aspects of American power and, as such, represents “smart power”—doing more with less. The concept is that the world’s most dynamic economies are in Asia, and therefore, the United States must reassert its influence in the region, especially by expanding free trade networks (e.g., the Trans-Pacific Partnership), but also by providing diplomatic “boots on the ground”—faithfully attending the myriad regional multilateral talk shops that had been neglected to some extent in the previous administration. Although some shoring up of US prestige has seemed to occur under the new strategy, the reality of the “rebalancing” has regrettably fallen far short of expectations. As one of the leading thinkers on US-China relations, Kenneth Lieberthal, wrote in 2013: “Unfortunately, at this point [Obama’s rebalancing] strategy is in danger of actually enhancing rather than reducing bad security outcomes. . . . It is therefore time to rebalance judiciously the rebalancing strategy.”53 The rebalancing strategy has many readily identifiable problems, but perhaps the most damaging is its tendency toward militarization. This has occurred, by and large, because of the large and well-resourced military (and military-industrial complex) has jumped at the evident opportunity to “counterbalance” the alleged “peer competitor.” In other words, the policy has served to justify an impressive parade of weapons programs, as well as an intensified regimen of military exercises. An important critique of the “rebalancing” was published in the journal Foreign Affairs at the end of 2012. In this piece, China expert Robert Ross succinctly described the policy’s shortcomings: “The new US policy unnecessarily compounds Beijing’s insecurities and will only feed China’s aggressiveness, undermine regional stability, and decrease the possibility of cooperation between Beijing and Washington.” Ross asserts that Washington has turned to “costly initiatives whose force is disproportionate to the threat from China,” and he squarely blames Secretary Clinton’s clumsy diplomacy in Southeast Asia during mid-2010: “US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . . . directly inserted the US into these legally complex disputes. In July 2010 in Hanoi, after extensive discussions with all the claimants to the islands except China, Clinton declared US support for the negotiating positions of the Philippines and Vietnam.”54 A parallel analysis could also be made regarding Clinton’s October 2010 embrace of Japan’s position regarding the contested islands in the East China Sea (see chapter 9). Although Ross may be incorrect in underrating China’s military capabilities and also tends to exaggerate Beijing’s economic problems, his overall conclusion is sound and worthy of close attention: “The Obama administration’s pivot has not contributed to stability in Asia. Quite the opposite: It has made the region more tense and conflict prone. . . . The outbreak of hostilities in the region will become a real possibility, as China pushes back.” Through the hundreds of Chinese-language articles examined in this book, there is a plainly evident common theme: Most Chinese foreign policy and defense specialists are convinced that Washington seeks to contain and even derail China’s rise. Bilateral tensions have built up in almost all global regions but are most acute in East Asia for now. These tensions are deeply rooted and have been amply described in each chapter of this book. The case regarding “opportunity costs” accruing from major US-China tensions has also been made, including, but hardly limited to, nuclear proliferation, various humanitarian crises from Syria to Sudan to Myanmar, and, of course, regarding climate change. True, some movement is discernible on the critical climate change front, and it has been encouraging to see some degree of cooperation, albeit modest, between China and the United States in coordinating responses to the Ebola Crisis. But the question that needs to be continually asked is whether more US-China cooperation could be undertaken to address more global challenges. Arguments over uninhabited rocks should not distract from these larger imperatives, but that has largely been the case to date, unfortunately. Skeptics will inevitably counter that the major cause of East Asian tension is China’s “assertive” behavior. However, sophisticated strategists should immediately understand that the attempt to figure out “who started it?” is a blame game dripping with subjectivity that will not yield any serious conclusions. China is a great power that has always been moderately “assertive,” except perhaps a century ago, when it was literally a “failed state.” A simple beta test on the “assertive China” thesis is to see that China resorted to the significant use or demonstration of force in the 1950s (Korea), 1960s (against India), 1970s (against Vietnam), 1980s (against Vietnam), and in the 1990s (in the Taiwan crisis). Another interesting beta test on the “assertive China” thesis is to examine a period in American history that is somewhat comparable. A century ago, the United States was a “risen” power, completing its “manifest destiny,” and taking up a new, uncertain, and unprecedented role on the world stage. In 1846–47, a border dispute with Mexico eventually yielded six new states (including California) for the brash American Republic. As noted earlier in this chapter, between 1890 and 1920, the United States conducted no less than thirty-five significant military interventions in Latin America. During that period, US troops also took the lead role in storming the ancient walls of Beijing—a troubling event that is commemorated in the very first room of China’s newly refurbished Party History Museum (and is discussed in some detail in chapter 2). Thus, Western analysts, who term contemporary Chinese foreign policy “newly assertive,” not only lack perspective regarding patterns in the Chinese use of force but also appear unable or unwilling to view such accusations in comparative perspective—that is, relative to the rise of other great powers in modern history. Parading coast guard cutters that employ water cannons in contested sea zones cannot objectively be termed “assertive” in any meaningful way. In an obvious contrast, Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008 and its annexation of Crimea in 2014 clearly constitute assertive behavior. Perhaps America’s greatest fear is that China’s behavior will simply replicate that of America a century ago? Such a realization should result in some circumspection and hopefully a new maturity in Washington’s approach to the Asia-Pacific region. Indeed, a good model to study may well be that of Great Britain as it sought to reach a modus vivendi with an ever more powerful and self-confident United States a century ago. Several additional problems with the “rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific” need still to be briefly addressed, even if they cannot be elaborated here in great detail. Above, the diplomatic opportunity costs were briefly touched upon. But one must also consider the straightforward financial costs of the pivot, because resources are finite. This will mean that the defense budget cannot be trimmed to support “nation building at home”—schools, bridges, and the like. It will mean that the US armed forces (and likely the Chinese PLA) will continue to emphasize war-fighting and deterrence capabilities at the expense of key nontraditional security missions, including peacekeeping, disaster relief and coping with pandemic outbreaks. It will mean that US aid projects are focused on countries on the other side of the world (e.g., Myanmar) rather than those needy countries next door (e.g., Haiti). It will also mean that certain poor, developing countries (e.g., the Philippines), but also certain developed but strained countries (e.g., Japan), will devote unnecessary sums to developing major weapons systems to deter or fight China versus other national priorities. This trade-off emerged in stark relief in the fall of 2013, when it was announced that Manila was considering major new defense outlays—for example, frigates and submarines—even as the country’s third largest city on the island of Mindanao was enveloped in the bloody chaos of a resurgent insurrection. After the tragedy of the massive typhoon hitting the Philippines in October 2013, one wonders if sufficient funds in Manila will be devoted to making the island archipelago genuinely more resilient for facing increasingly powerful storms. Or rather, such obviously urgent imperatives might regrettably be sacrificed in the name of defense preparedness and safeguarding national sovereignty. Yet another problem with the “rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific” has been the extent to which it has been pushed and shepherded along by “third parties.” These third parties are regional states concerned to protect the status quo in the face of a rapidly rising China and a United States that is evidently undergoing an identity crisis after two failed conflicts in the Middle East. Essentially, leaders and diplomats from various East Asian states—but above all those from Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Singapore—have exercised a significant influence on Washington—urging it in increasingly desperate tones to “stand up to Beijing’s bullying.” American susceptibility to such arguments reflects an apparent psychological desire to be perceived as playing a vital or “indispensable” role in global security—at bottom, the simple human need to be needed and liked, actually. What a pleasant break from vitriolic debates over fiscal and social problems to be told emphatically by East Asian leaders that US moral and strategic leadership is imperative and then to bask in the consequent adulation. In any contest with Beijing, these states are perceived as “underdogs,” and they may also benefit from liberal antipathy to the Chinese regime, even though several of these countries cannot actually be termed democracies. Then, there is the fact that these small states are frequently more focused on direct policy outcomes (e.g., a given joint statement or joint military exercise)—and thus are able to successfully apply pressure on US officials, who may hold a less certain and more ambiguous disposition regarding various regional disputes. These regional appeals, which the author has witnessed on more than a few occasions, form the “demand signal” that Obama administration officials claim is the driving force behind the pivot. This somewhat subtle and rather insidious diplomacy exercised by various officials (and often retirees) from third-party states is not quite irrational, but is certainly shortsighted because their respective countries will hardly benefit from increased US-China tensions. Where current US strategists have gravely miscalculated is in reasoning that US national security interests in the Asia-Pacific are simply equivalent to the sum of the concerns of all allies and partners. Indeed, the worst outcome of those tensions would certainly be catastrophic for them, because their countries would be the most likely blood-soaked battleground for any US-China military contest. In general, these countries are quite mistaken if they think that the American public is prepared to go to war with China over uninhabited rocks. Regrettably, it seems that in recent strategic deliberations, Washington has too often been “played” by odious nationalist and parochial interests in these allied and partner states. But are these countries not sincerely frightened by “scary” China? Children talk of monsters hiding under the bed or in the closet as “scary,” and these fears are almost always irrational—even as they are natural and wholly understandable. At the national level, moreover, “scare” tactics may be used to advance the interest of certain domestic political groups within front-line countries. Overall, we may wish to be empathetic to these various regional concerns—even as we might be empathetic to the fears of a child—but we should not confuse this empathy with sound and rational foreign policy. A more thoughtful perspective understands that (1) China’s rise will inevitably occasion some anxiety and instability; (2) China’s military buildup is largely driven by its historical experience of invasion and vulnerability; (3) Beijing has not resorted to the major use of force in more than three decades; and (4) most fundamentally, China may quibble over various rocks and reefs with neighbors, but it is emphatically not likely to invade either Honshu or Luzon, nor even Okinawa or Palawan. The role of scholars here needs to be to help separate rational and irrational fears and responses. Apart from the “free-riding” aspects of current and evolving defense arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region that are disturbing and contrary to US national interests, there is the problem that US partners and allies should benefit US national security and not form a strategic liability that could drag a reluctant Washington into wars over matters of no strategic consequence. An “offshore balancing” approach to US foreign policy, based on caution and on purely defensive arrangements, would better serve US national security interests. After all, China is rising into a thicket of strongly capable and strong willed powers that are hardly ready to bend to Beijing’s will. Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, and India have all indicated a clear willingness—even an eagerness—to confront various Chinese claims and policies. The argument by various “hawks” that these states will cave to Beijing without robust American backing seems unwarranted. Moreover, the further claim that these states would subsequently “bandwagon” with China against the United States is even more grossly misleading. In other words, there is no possibility that China could turn the tables in the all-important global balance of power against the United States. As White states: “While [China] is strong, it is not that strong” (emphasis added); and Chinese leaders understand this fact in spades.55 A final deleterious myth propagated by various “hawks” is the notion that any reforms to American strategy and related commitments will inevitably collapse the entire structure of East Asia and even global security. This notion is patently false, and the US strategic position has inevitably been strengthened by various adjustments, whether undertaken during the Cold War, such as the withdrawal of US bases from Taiwan, and even more obviously the total US pullout from Vietnam, or after the Cold War, such as the 40 percent drawdown in US troops from the Korean Peninsula undertaken by George W. Bush.56 In actuality, alliances and security arrangements are strengthened by reforms that bring their means and goals in conformity with global and regional power and political realities. Such reforms would actually help the “credibility” of American commitments. However, the United States should only undertake the resort to arms when actual national interests are at stake and not for the sake of credibility alone. In fact, a recent reexamination of the role of credibility concerns among US decision makers in the Cuban Missile Crisis concludes: “This approach to foreign policy was guided—and remains guided—by a . . . school-playground view of world politics rather than the cool appraisal of strategic realities. It put—and still puts—America in the curious position of having to go to war to uphold the very credibility that is supposed to obviate war in the first place.”57 As Steinberg and O’Hanlon conclude: “The abstract fear of dominoes falling does not require that every perceived provocation be fully rebuffed by force.”58 Unfortunately, rivalry has a powerful self-reinforcing dynamic that may make the credibility argument seem logical, whether in seeking out new security commitments or within crises. The arguments of those pushing for aggressive and noncompromising solutions gain force in a climate of nationalism, xenophobia, and sensationalism, perhaps especially where pithy bloggers or outrageous video clips may outweigh prudence and the careful examination of facts viewed within a larger historical context. Smaller countries, moreover, may push their parochial viewpoints, exaggerating the will and capabilities of the superpowers to determine regional outcomes in their favor, pushing the region to the brink of disaster. Powerful military-industrial complexes on both sides of the Pacific will no doubt see a mortal threat in the other that leads them to ask for ever larger percentages of national wealth to push the boundaries of science in the name of national defense. Uniformed personnel on both sides, perhaps driven by a “cult of the offensive,” could argue for greater “forward” deployments and even for “shock and awe”–type destabilizing first strikes. In short, the tendencies toward rivalry are multifarious and potent. This brings us to the final problem with the “rebalancing strategy to the Asia-Pacific.” It posits no special initiative, institutions, or mechanism to control and mitigate the US-China rivalry that is now developing into full and perilous bloom. To the contrary, the strategy feeds upon rivalry and then inflames it further.
The Trump economic plan has spawned a bull market in optimism, sending CEO spirits and stock prices soaring. But a spike in another metric–interest rates–threatens to scuttle the President's pledge to restore American growth to heights unseen since well before the Great Recession. In the minutes to its January meeting, the Fed revealed that "many" officials had advocated raising rates "fairly soon," so long as the economy kept chugging. But after hiking its benchmark rate in December for the second time in a decade, the Fed was wary of adding another increase because of "considerable uncertainty" surrounding the Trump administration's "expansionary fiscal policy," and its possible impact on what matters most to the Fed: the future course of inflation. While the Fed cautiously assesses Trumponomics, investors are taking the lead. The bond market has already seen a notable shift. Since mid-2016, the rate on 10-year Treasuries has jumped a full point, to 2.43%. And 60% of that the increase came in the three months and change following the election. (For more on the president's economic agenda, read "The Promise and the Peril of the Trump Economy.") Sundry market watchers think that rates will keep climbing. In a recent report, Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts that the 10-year will yield 3.2% by the fourth quarter of this year. That would mean a jump of roughly 80 basis points from today's level, and a rise of 104 basis points from the final quarter of 2016, which would be one of the largest 12-month increases since the 1990s. The power behind the surge: Investors are betting that Trump's policies will spur inflation, now running at a modest 1.6%, to rise swiftly. The reason is two-fold. First, the new president promises increased spending on infrastructure, veterans' benefits, and the military, while at the same time championing steep corporate and personal tax cuts. It's likely that the plan will greatly deepen annual federal budget deficits that are already on course to reach over $1 trillion, or 19% of all spending, in 2023. Sweet predicts that the Trump plan could cost an additional $1.5 trillion over the next decade. That extra spending means that lenders would get a lot more worried about America's debt and deficits a lot sooner. As the U.S. strives to borrow more than the Chinese and other foreign governments feel comfortable lending, the Treasury will need to offer far higher rates to entice them to keep lending. Those same creditors will also fret that the big stimulus will hike inflation, and will demand a cushion in the form of richer yields. The second factor: The stimulus is coming at a most unusual time, when  the economy is already near full employment, and many industries are tight on capacity in plants and production facilities. "The Fed isn't worried right now about how this will be paid for, but about whether all this spending and tax cuts will boost the economy, and boost inflation," says Paul Ashworth, an economist with Capital Economics in Toronto. "For the Fed, it's all about inflation." The fear is that the spending will rapidly lift wages because of a shortage of workers, and that the extra take-home pay, enhanced by lower taxes, will chase cars and appliances that are in short supply. The new administration's hardline stance on illegal immigration could speed up this cycle, by exacerbating the labor shortage. Put together, that's a classic recipe for inflation. Trump has a totally different vision. In his mind, the plan will create a virtuous cycle of investment and durable growth. Companies will spend heavily on capital investment, and as they expand, pull millions of working-age folks who've quit the labor force back into offices and factories. The surge in capex will raise productivity through purchases of efficient machinery, and innovative technology that makes supply chains more efficient. That combination would cause production and the labor force to expand in tandem with demand for both products and workers, thus holding real prices in check. It's obvious, however, that both investors and the Fed think that a surge in prices is far more likely than the supply side revolution that Trump promises. The evidence is the rate rise that's already occurred as a harbinger of inflation to come. If a surge in the labor and output doesn't occur, the spike in growth will fade quickly. "You're juicing the economy for a short period," says Ashworth, "but it can't grow at 3% without high inflation because productivity and labor can't keep up. You run up against hard constraints." In that scenario, the Fed is forced to raise rates even further to stanch inflation, causing a recession. "We haven't repealed the business cycle," says Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae. "This is already one of the longest expansions on record."  A crucial, mainly overlooked driver is the dollar. The greenback is already sitting at lofty levels, having appreciated by 20% against a broad basket of currencies over the past three years. But two forces could push the dollar far higher. First, the gigantic borrowing on its own will raise rates well above those of nations from France to South Korea that aren't in expansion mode. Foreign governments will pile into Treasuries for their safety and fat yields. Second, as part of its campaign to quell inflation, the Fed would be likely to adopt a strong dollar policy, once again, by keeping rates at levels that would attract plenty of cash from abroad. That combination of circumstances would make our cars and drugs a lot more costly in foreign markets, lowering exports, and dampening growth, and with it, inflation. At the same time, a weak dollar would make imports of clothes, cell phones and PCs far cheaper, exerting more downward pressure on prices.
Mercenaries are persons who are not members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict but participate in combat primarily for personal gain. They may be authorized to fight by a party to the conflict, but their allegiance to that party is conditioned on monetary payment rather than obedience and loyalty.32 For this reason, mercenaries are sometimes treated as “unlawful combatants” or “unprivileged belligerents,” even though their employment is not strictly prohibited by international law.33 As discussed above, they may not qualify for POW treatment under the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (GPW), and those meeting the definition of “mercenary” under the 1977 Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions34 are explicitly denied combatant status.35 Because mercenaries are not entitled to combat immunity, they may be tried, and if found guilty, punished for their hostile actions (including by the death penalty), even if such actions would be lawful under the law of war if committed by a soldier. Soldiers with a nationality other than that of the party on whose side they fight are not automatically considered mercenaries.36 Article 47 of Protocol I defines a mercenary as follows: 2. A mercenary is any person who: (a) Is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict; (b) Does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities; (c) Is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party; (d) Is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict; (e) Is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and (f) Has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.37 Under this definition, it appears that contractor personnel who are not U.S. nationals, the nationals of other coalition allies or nationals of the host country, and who were hired to—and in fact do—take part in hostilities might be considered to be mercenaries, assuming the definition in Protocol I applies as customary international law in the context of the current hostilities. On the other hand, what constitutes “direct participation in an armed conflict” is not fully settled, and some of the other requirements are inherently difficult to prove, particularly the element of 32 See Gregory P. Noone, The History and Evolution of the Law of War Prior to World War II, 47 NAVAL L. REV. 176, 187 (2000) (recounting origin of prohibition on mercenaries after the Middle Ages). 33 See Singer, supra note 14, at 534. 34 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) art. 47, June 8, 1977, reprinted in 16 I.L.M. 1391. 35 Id. art. 43. 36 See HILAIRE MCCOUBREY, 2 INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW 145 (1998)(noting that not all foreigners in service of armed forces of other countries should be treated as “mercenaries,” as some may serve with the approval of their home governments or for moral or ideological reasons); HOWARD S. LEVIE, PRISONERS OF WAR IN INTERNATIONAL ARMED CONFLICT 75 (1979) (describing entitlement to POW status of nationals of neutral states or states allied with enemy state as well-settled, while status of an individual who is a national of a capturing state or its allies is subject to dispute). 37 The United States has not ratified Protocol I; however, some of its provisions may be considered binding as customary international law.

Ever since the Tiananmen Massacre of June 4, 1989, the issue of human rights has remained in the forefront of China’s rela­tions with the West. There are, of course, multiple dimensions to the definition of “human rights,” but when evoked in relation to China by the Western media, the phrase is invariably meant as a reminder of what China is lacking, such as democracy and freedom of speech for its live citizens and basic humane respect for its political pris­oners, whose body organs are reportedly being harvested in a massive, lucrative underground international trade. Indeed, Western, especially U.S., journalism has in recent years identified human rights as the way to make any mainland Chinese story newsworthy, and any slight dis­pleasure at China is enough to instigate yet another round of wrathful accounts about how utterly barbaric this country still remains. When being rebuffed by Chinese authorities on one occasion during Bill Clin­ton’s historic visit to the People’s Republic in the summer of 1998, one American journalist, for instance, vowed to “do the human rights story every day.” 1 In the reports that regularly come to the attention of the U.S. public about the arrest, imprisonment, and maltreatment of political dissidents, about the Chinese government’s connivance at and participation in the trading of body parts from executed prisoners, and about the continued prohibition of public discussions of democracy in what has become a thriving capitalist economy in the PRC, one thing looms large with re­markable consistency: the fraught relationship between what seems to be a universal issue (human rights) and the specifics of a local, particular culture (China). The argument often put forth by the Chinese govern­ment in its own defense is that human rights in China cannot be the same as human rights in the West. Accordingly, whereas the West asserts its moral claims on the basis of a universalist rhetoric traceable to the Eu­ropean Enlightenment, China is reduced to a reactive position from which it must and can speak only in terms of its own cultural and local specifics, in terms of its own historical differences. This typical discursive scenario amounts to a division of cultural labor on the international scene; it is one that hardly needs to be elaborated but badly needs to be challenged. Instead of viewing one party, the West, as the holder of some absolute, uncompromisable value and the other, China, as a stubborn, wayward resister to all that is reasonable, it would perhaps be more pro­ductive, in light of Foucault’s notion of biopower, to view the West and China as collaborative partners in an ongoing series of biopolitical trans­actions in global late capitalism, transactions whereby human rights, or, more precisely, humans as such, are the commodity par excellence. In exiling its political dissidents in single file, while others continue to be arrested and imprisoned,2 the mainland Chinese government is, de facto, setting itself up as a business enterprise that deals in politicized human persons as precious commodities, the release of which, as the logic of commodification goes, is systematically regulated—by the rules of demand and supply and by the continued presence of an interested buyer. It is as if, in order to honor its part in the business relationship, China must act in good faith by constantly maintaining a supply of the goods being demanded by the West. As some prisoners are traded off, others need be caught and put away in order to replenish the national stockpile, so that transactions can proceed periodically to the satisfac­tion of the trading parties concerned. Scandalous though this may sound, the point is that human rights can no longer be understood pure­ly on humanitarian grounds but rather must also be seen as an inherent part—entirely brutal yet also entirely logical—of transnational corpo­ratism, under which anything, including human beings or parts of hu­man beings, can become exchangeable for its negotiated equivalent val­ue.3 By releasing its political prisoners—who can be seen as a kind of national product—in a regulated manner, the Chinese authorities ac­complish the pragmatic goal of forcing Western nations to soften their rhetoric against China and thus of receiving more trading privileges and opportunities over time. It is important to emphasize that the Chinese are not the only ones to benefit from such releases. Western companies, which eye the Chi­nese market with candid rapacity but are often inconvenienced by the moral embarrassment of conducting business with a totalitarian regime, also stand to gain substantially from the Chinese government’s calcu­lated moves. In other words, the “humane” release of famous dissidents arises, in practice, from the same cold-blooded logic of economic trans­actions as what only appears to be its opposite, namely, the egregious, abusive trading of organs from slaughtered Chinese prisoners. The two kinds of trades form a diversified but cohesive globalized financial or­der: when dead, humans are exchanged in the form of replaceable body parts; when still alive, they are exchanged whole—body and soul—for lucrative long-term trading arrangements that benefit the entire nation. The ostensible trade in nonhuman commodities between China and the West—the clothes, toys, industrial equipment, household accessories, and their like—is concurrently facilitated by this other, unmentionable trade in humans as commodities.
Vasquez de la Rosa stated that while the human rights conditions placed upon the release of 15% of the funding for Plan Merida are good in theory, Mexico does not meet the criteria. He argues that social justice organizations would have to play a more powerful and more clearly defined role in order to effectively monitor the use of the money, because there are no clear mechanisms for transparent monitoring of the Merida funds. Although social justice organizations write reports or make recommendations, the government simply disregards them. Vasquez de la Rosa echoes many other social justice groups in Mexico when he says that three years after Calderon declared a war on drugs and sent in the military to fight cartels, the level of insecurity and violence in Mexico has only increased. He also says that the war on drugs has led to detrimental changes in the Mexican justice system, pointing to the concept of pre-charge detention, or “arraigo,” where a person suspected of a crime can be held for 80 to 120 days without charge while the government tries to build its case, and a new law enabling security forces to search homes without a warrant. Bricker describes it as an “organized crime track with fewer due process.” Vasquez de la Rosa suggests a different tactic is necessary in the war on drugs, saying that an investment in security is not enough because of poverty and corruption in Mexico. He points to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which went into effect 1994, for having exacerbated poverty in Mexico, displaced two million small farmers, and dramatically increased migration to the United States so people could earn a living. Due to this, investment in Mexico’s economic development is key to dismantling the power of cartels, especially in terms of creating jobs. Jereski also critiques the Merida Initiative as “a response to the mobilization against the poverty and other social, cultural, and economic dislocations caused by NAFTA.”
Ruth Hopkins, a writer at Indian Country Today, set off a small firestorm last month when she tweeted that a Washington source had told her President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos“have plans to scrap” the Bureau of Indian Education. There hasn’t been any official indication from the Trump administration that the tweet is correct, but frankly there are few agencies more worthy of elimination than the one in question. Just ask Keith Moore, who led the bureau from 2010-12. He told me it was “an inefficient, ineffective, poorly structured bureaucracy,” which was also the gist of a memo he sent to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar shortly before resigning. The first problem he sees is purely structural: The Bureau of Indian Education is part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, not the Education Department. This means the same agency that oversees natural-resource use and land development also is in charge of education. Mr. Moore said, “I found it interesting that it was hard to track how the dollars were spent when they were allocated by Congress.” Only about 7% of Native children attended BIE schools in 2013, according to Education Week. That’s approximately 48,000 students at 183 schools. The education they receive is abysmal. A lawsuit filed in federal court last month by the Havasupai tribe near the Grand Canyon offers a useful example. The tribe is suing the government over its terrible management at the tribe’s elementary school. In the 2012-13 school year, students scored in the third percentile for math and the first percentile for reading. The problem is not a lack of funding. Bureau of Indian Education schools spent approximately $20,000 per pupil in 2014, according to an analysis by the Cato Institute, compared with a national average of $12,400. Even so, their graduation rate is 53% compared with a national average of 81%. The agency can’t even keep the buildings from falling down. As then-Rep. John Kline (R., Minn.), explained at a hearing in 2015, “You’ve got collapsing roofs, leaking roofs, buckling floors, exposed wires, popping circuit breakers, gas leaks. That’s totally unacceptable.” According to a 2014 report by the Government Accountability Office, the agency was aware that 24 schools had misspent $13.8 million in federal Indian School Equalization Program funding on unallowable expenses. But as RiShawn Biddle pointed out on the blog Dropout Nation, “the agency has done nothing to follow-up on the evidence, either by conducting second audits to determine the weaknesses of the schools’ financial controls, or to sanction the schools and tribes that operate them for the malfeasance.” Given the management problems at the agency, the situation is hardly surprising. Its 34th director in 38 years was removed last spring for using his influence to give jobs to a relative as well as a girlfriend. Rather than be subject to this kind of incompetence and corruption, lawyers for the Havasupai tribe argue that the tribe, not the federal government, should control education. But schools run by tribes, or state-run public schools near reservations, don’t offer much better education. The high-school graduation rate for American Indians, including those not living on reservations, is 69%. Many schools are plagued by violence and a shortage of teachers. One reason is that tribal leaders are sometimes hostile to the presence of non-Native Americans in the classroom, or even of those who have been educated off the reservation. At Wounded Knee Elementary School on the Pine Ridge Reservation, all of the teachers from Teach for America were fired one year as part of a “reorganization plan,” the underlying implication being that they were interlopers and not welcome. As a follow-up to her first tweet, Ms. Hopkins wrote: “If the BIE is dismantled by Trump and DeVos it will hurt Native children & create major job loss on the Rez. We cannot afford this.” Put another way, schools are a jobs program that Native leaders don’t want to lose. Even if they were inclined to change, it’s hard to imagine where a geographically isolated tribe like the Havasupai will find qualified teachers. Last year, Sen. John McCain proposed legislation that would create education savings accounts for students enrolled in BIE schools, so they could use these funds to attend other schools. Though Mrs. DeVos doesn’t control the agency, this is the type of legislation she should back. She could also help fund contracts between tribes and successful charter-school organizations to revamp the Native education systems. Dan Nelson, a facilities manager at one of the schools on Pine Ridge, was recently part of a group of parents and grandparents who flew to Denver to visit some high-performing charters. He told me, “The system that we have been using is tired. The teachers are helpless to control their work environments. They just do what they have to rather than being active in changing things.”
The White House is preparing a directive that would require federal agencies to publicly disclose for the first time where they fly drones in the United States and what they do with the torrents of data collected from aerial surveillance.¶ The presidential executive order would force the Pentagon, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies to reveal more details about the size and surveillance capabilities of their growing drone fleets — information that until now has been largely kept under wraps.¶ The mandate would apply only to federal drone flights in U.S. airspace. Overseas military and intelligence operations would not be covered.¶ President Obama has yet to sign the executive order, but officials said that drafts have been distributed to federal agencies and that the process is in its final stages. “An interagency review of the issue is underway,” said Ned Price, a White House spokesman. He declined to comment further.¶ Privacy advocates said the measure was long overdue. Little is known about the scope of the federal government’s domestic drone operations and surveillance policies. Much of what¶ has emerged was obtained¶ under court order as a result of public-records lawsuits.¶ “We’re undergoing a quiet revolution in aerial surveillance,” said Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. “But we haven’t had all in one place a clear picture of how this technology is being used. Nor is it clear that the agencies themselves know how it is being used.”¶ Most affected by the executive order would be the Pentagon, which conducts drone training missions in most states, and Homeland Security, which flies surveillance drones along the nation’s borders round-the-clock. It would also cover other agencies with little-known drone programs, including NASA, the Interior Department and the Commerce Department. Military and law enforcement agencies would not have to reveal sensitive operations. But they would have to post basic information about their privacy safeguards for the vast amount of full-motion video and other imagery collected by drones.¶ Until now, the armed forces and federal law enforcement agencies have been reflexively secretive about drone flights and even less forthcoming about how often they use the aircraft to conduct domestic surveillance.
Marxism, as Robert Tucker has argued, can be seen as a distorted mythic symbol in which the struggle of good and evil within the individual is projected onto social classes: the blood-sucking capitalist class fights (vainly) to dominate the creative-productive working class. When the capitalist class is destroyed by the proletariat, alienation will supposedly be destroyed as well. If Marxist revolutionaries can bring down the center of capitalism, the United States, world-history will supposedly begin its Golden Age. This myth is so attractive to many people because it portrays in social-class terms the problems that each individual must face. A person committed to the revolutionary cause can through this projection postpone the painful process of their own individuation. It goes without saying, of course, that capitalism is in fact responsible for social ills, but neither the capitalist class nor its individual constituents are the embodiment and source of evil. The dark side is an aspect of every human being; it cannot be eliminated by social revolution
The US Navy is also unable to meet its commitment to field two carrier strike groups, with another three able to surge and deploy should the need arise. Even if sequestration cuts are reversed and full funding is restored, service leaders have said it would be at least 2018 before the Navy would be able to regain those operational readiness levels. “Gaps in carrier coverage threaten to undermine both the US ability to deter conflict and respond to crises,” Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Virginia and chairman of the House Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee, said Tuesday during a hearing on the carrier situation. Members of the House Subcommittee on Readiness joined with Seapower members in the hearing. And even as Sean Stackley, the Navy’s top acquisition official, acknowledged that the carrier “is at the very core of our maritime strategy,” he and a panel of admirals provided detailed testimony why shortages will continue, and why the fleet will remain at 10 ships for the time being, rather than the 11-ship fleet mandated by Congress. “We require 11, today we have 10,” Stackley said. “We have more in depot maintenance today than we would normally have under a stable operational cycle. So we have a shortfall in our ability to generate the forces we need.” We discussed this very issue in-depth over a year ago in this previous Foxtrot Alpha post, contemplating not just size, but also propulsion, as in nuclear versus fossil fuel, for potential future carrier designs. The reality is that America’s super carrier size is hard to justify as the carrier air wings they host have shrunk over the last couple of decades. During the cold War, close to 90 aircraft would call the decks of a Nimitz Class carrier home. Today that number is more like 60 to 65 aircraft, many of which have direct commonality with one another. The idea is not to replace the super carrier entirely with more plentiful and less expensive smaller carriers, but to replace a portion of the super carrier fleet as they retire. Just the cost of building a super carrier has ballooned, with the price of the USS John F. Kennedy being (CVN-79) at nearly $12 billion, that is after the billions of dollars in development costs that have already been sunk into the first in class USS Gerald R. Ford, a ship that has been dogged by poor procurement strategy and technical difficulties. With this in mind, affording one-for-one replacements of the existing carrier fleet could crush the Navy’s ship-building budget, especially with other uncertain fleet priorities looming, like replacing the Ohio Class of nuclear ballistic missile submarines. For less than the cost of one Ford Class super carrier, the U.S. Navy could purchase two Queen Elizabeth Class carriers. Even with U.S. modifications, including catapults and arresting gear, these ships could very well cost even less than what they do today as the baseline research and development costs would have largely been already paid for by the British Ministry of Defense. If we could replace every other super carrier with two modified Queen Elizabeth class carriers, we could drastically increase our carrier force’s flexibility. In doing so, the Navy would have to think differently about how it uses its carrier-borne personnel, escorts and air wings. Still, savings garnered by building smaller carriers could be reallocated to adapting to such a new way of doing business. Like so many other 100% solution, high-cost military vehicles, they may be perceived as very effective in combat but they can only be in one place at one time, and often that place is in the shipyard or the maintenance hangar. By building smaller carriers, and more of them, Navy commanders will be able to better pair their available resources with the mission at hand. For instance, you do not need a super carrier for simply creating a strong presence in a region, or to support low-intensity warfare operations, or to train aircrews, or to execute good-will tours. In fact, smaller carriers would provide everything a super carrier could, although at diminished sortie rates. For missions where a super carrier’s capability is needed, and if none are available, two smaller carriers can be deployed in one’s place. A one-size-fits-all, and that size being extra-large, approach to America’s carrier force will likely be unsustainable in the coming decades. With America’s Navy having to be in more places at one time than ever, breaking the old super-carrier or bust mold will be essential for meeting the mission demands of the future. This is especially true as the U.S. looks to “pivot towards the pacific” and to confront China’s anti-access/area denial strategy, one where more carriers will be far more useful than fewer super carriers.
The figuration of the underdeveloped/non-white/non-Western as being trapped in a state of arrested development, needing to be rescued by the white Westerner, is further exemplified when addressing how the underdeveloped/non-white/non-Western is also figured in relation to their gendered perversions. Despite white Western feminist literature promoting notions of a ‘global sisterhood’ – that is, women, regardless of race or colonial context, live a shared experience simply because they are women (Goudge 2004) – the reality remains that the non-white/non-Western woman is characterised as a helpless, oppressed creature who, with the help of her white Western ‘sisters’ must break the shackles of her cultural imprisonment in order to become a developed liberal feminist and join the ‘correct’ path towards developed civilisation (Parpart 1995; Brantlinger 1985). Rather than accounting for racial, colonial and historical contexts surrounding gender inequalities in the non-white world, and how they might differ from gender inequalities experienced by Euro-American women, Western feminists instead appear to have adapted Spivak’s 1988 observation of the Western world’s relationship with the underdeveloped: from ‘white men saving brown women from brown men’[1] (Spivak 1988: 93), to ‘white women saving their brown sisters from brown men.’ Despite assertions of a global sisterhood and shared experience, women living in the developing world are figured as gendered, as well as racial, failures. This is often seen in relation to the underdeveloped woman as, on the one hand, the subject of sexual oppression, their sexual life controlled and dictated by (brown) men (Reid 1997), and on the other, as inherently over-sexed and sexually perverse in nature. For example, in nineteenth century Britain, prostitutes ‘were treated as involved in a criminal act, whereas Indian women were understood as belonging to a class, of being (ontologically and essentially) prostitutes’ (Briggs 2002: 24). Unlike the white, British prostitute, who was deemed criminal and out of the ordinary, sex work was accepted as an innate part of the underdeveloped Indian woman’s being. In many ways such paradoxical figurations of the underdeveloped woman feed into the Western constructed narrative of the underdeveloped as in need of guidance away from the degeneracy of their cultural lives and towards the Western pinnacles of liberalism and whiteness (or failing that, pseudo-whiteness). 2.3 Sexual Perversions These somewhat contradictory figurations of the underdeveloped as both sexually oppressed and sexually degenerate can also be noted in relation to Western perceptions of the (homo)sexuality of the underdeveloped, where the underdeveloped is figured as sexually perverse, both in terms of sexual deviance and in terms of lacking sexual enlightenment. In the first instance homosexuality, when applied to the figure of the underdeveloped, is associated with sexual deviance, decadence and degeneracy. As Neville Hoad observes, ‘decadence and degeneracy…are both developmental tropes…what the decadent/degenerate shares with the primitive is a position on the fringes of the normative evolutionary narrative’ (Hoad 2000: 137). Homosexuality is consistently linked to the underdeveloped; once again we return to this notion of arrested development in which ‘the homosexual is the figure of arrested development of the heterosexual, as the primitive is the figure of arrested development of the civilised’ (ibid: 144). For example, the academic William A. Rushing explains high HIV prevalence rates in sub-Saharan Africa as the consequence of a ‘hidden homosexuality.’ Despite overwhelming evidence that suggest that it is heterosexual sex that is the main cause of HIV transmission in the region, for Rushing the only accountable explanation for such high instances of the disease on the African continent lay in degenerate homosexual activity (Rushing 1995; Oppong and Kalipeni 2004). Yet, at the same time, the underdeveloped is portrayed in need of development through this narrative of their lacking sexual enlightenment and tolerance. In contrast to the ‘gay-friendly’ West, the developing world is inherently homophobic, yet another sign in Western eyes that the Third World is in need of development. The West has adopted attitudes to homosexuality as a marker of how developed a nation is; ‘the logic goes something like this: you are less developed than us because you treat your gays badly. Thus the western state becomes guarantor of lesbian and gay rights versus the threat constituted by the savage brutal other’ (Binnie 2004: 76). This narrative of the West as protector of the homosexual, and the non-West as underdeveloped due to their inability to treat their homosexuals with tolerance is exemplified in Western reactions to the regular re-emergence of homophobic legislature in Uganda (to be discussed in more detail in a later section of this essay). Whilst abhorrence at such homophobic legislature may be genuine, Western nations conveniently ignore issues of homophobia that still rage within their own borders, as well as the fact that the homophobia of the underdeveloped world has its roots in colonialism and the spread of traditional Christian moralities in the Third World and that homophobia may have been exported through colonialism (Binnie 2004). The Western world expresses its whiteness as a ‘badge of superiority’ (Goudge 2004: 8), in which their supposed tolerance of homosexuality elevates them to the position of the ‘developed world’, and the non-Western world is in need of development because they apply no such tolerance. These figurations of the underdeveloped as both homophobic and sexually deviant emphasise the ongoing project of the Western world to fortify its hegemonic position as ‘developed’, and the non-Western/non-white world as ‘underdeveloped’, regardless of the often contradictory and hypocritical nature of the ways in which the underdeveloped is figured as in need of development.
Latin America is increasingly attractive as a source for large emerging economies with rising commodity import needs. The recent large find of oil and gas in Brazilian waters has only added to that attraction.¶ Thus, with their large reserves of commodities, especially non-renewable resources in high demand from the global market, Latin American countries should be in the catbird’s seat, calling shots and setting prices. Yet, despite the allure of the region for resource-hungry emerging economies like China, the cards are not necessarily stacked in Latin America’s favor. Unless the region develops policies of sustainable development and transparent transactions, the advantages it enjoys from its riches could prove to be limited.¶ Latin America produces 47 percent of the world’s soybean crop, 40 percent of copper and 9.3 percent of its crude oil – and in five years Brazilian oil will add to that. China needs an increasing amount of such commodities both as inputs in its fast industrialization process and for private consumption, given the nation’s rapidly rising living standards. Its commodity imports are set to rise at lower double-digit rates until at least 2020. Annual average oil and copper import growth rates have recently been 10 times higher than average import growth rates for the rest of the world.
If the National Security Agency’s bulk­ data program expires, the coroner should conclude that it was “Death by Bumper Sticker.” Rarely has a controversial government program been so fiercely debated and so poorly understood. Authorized by soon-to-­expire Section 215 of the Patriot Act, it has been brought to the edge of extinction by a couple of simple but inaccurate phrases, including “listening to your phone calls” and “domestic spying.” You can listen to orations on the NSA program for hours and be outraged by its violation of our liberties, inspired by the glories of the Fourth Amendment and prepared to mount the barricades to stop the NSA in its tracks — and still have no idea what the program actually does. That’s what the opponents leave out or distort, since their case against the program becomes so much less compelling upon fleeting contact with reality. The program involves so-­called metadata, information about phone calls, but not the content of the calls — things like the numbers called, the time of the call, the duration of the call. The phone companies have all this information, which the NSA acquires from them. What happens next probably won’t shock you, and it shouldn’t. As Rachel Brand of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board writes, “It is stored in a database that may be searched only by a handful of trained employees, and even they may search it only after a judge has determined that there is evidence connecting a specific phone number to terrorism.” The charge of domestic spying is redolent of the days when J. Edgar Hoover targeted and harassed Martin Luther King Jr. Not only is there zero evidence of any such abuse, it isn’t even possible based on the NSA database alone. There are no names with the numbers. As former prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy points out, whitepages.com has more personal identifying information. The NSA is hardly a rogue agency. Its program is overseen by a special panel of judges, and it has briefed Congress about its program for years. In the context of all that is known about us by private companies, the NSA is a piker. Take the retailer Target, for example. According to The New York Times, it collects your “demographic information like your age, whether you are married and have kids, which part of town you live in, how long it takes you to drive to the store, your estimated salary, whether you’ve moved recently, what credit cards you carry in your wallet and what Web sites you visit.” Of course, the Fourth Amendment applies to the government, not private entities like Target. The amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures of our “persons, houses, papers, and effects.” If the NSA were breaking into homes and seizing metadata that people had carefully hidden away from prying eyes, it would be in flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment. But no one is in possession of his or her own metadata. Even if the NSA didn’t exist, metadata would be controlled by someone else, the phone companies. The Supreme Court has held that you don’t have an expectation of privacy for such information in the possession of a third party. One frightening way to look at mail delivery is that agents of the state examine and handle the correspondence of countless of millions of Americans. They aren’t violating anyone’s Fourth Amendment rights, though, because no one expects the outside of their envelopes to be private. There are legitimate criticisms of the NSA program. It currently hangs on vague phrasing in the Patriot Act. Congress should make it unmistakable that it is authorizing exactly what the NSA is doing. But the program doesn’t deserve the ignominy that has it in such political peril. The House has passed a reform that might render the program unworkable, and the Senate hasn’t yet been able to act. It is hard to match the power of a bumper sticker.
1. Parolees Have Not "Attempted to Evade the Consular Visa Process." The agencies should not assume that parolees "have attempted to evade the consular visa process" or have been in a position in which they "could have and should have sought and obtained an immigrant visa [*332] from a consular officer abroad, rather than arriving at a port-of-entry." n188 On the contrary, parole is only granted by the favorable discretion of the Secretary of DHS "for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit." n189 Thus, as the American Immigration Law Foundation ("AILF") n190 pointed out in comments it submitted to the agencies on the proposed regulations, "the very fact that the individual was granted parole in the discretion of the government indicates that the individual had a legitimate humanitarian or public interest reason for seeking entry into the United States" and, thus, that the purpose of the individual's coming to the U.S. was this recognized humanitarian or public interest, not any attempt to circumvent the visa process. n191 One need only look to the factual circumstances surrounding situations of parolees to see that this group of aliens did not enter the United States attempting to evade the consular visa process. "Parole has most often been granted to aliens fleeing unsettled conditions in their own country, when refugee status has not been granted for whatever reason." n192 Parole is also granted in a number of other circumstances that have nothing to do with an alien's attempt to evade the traditional consular visa process, such as when Delia Bona was granted parole after being evacuated to the United States at the military's insistence. n193 Thus, the assertion that parolees are typically aliens who attempted to circumvent the traditional immigration process is incorrect.
Several Latin American countries have spoken out against these inequalities of consumption and responsibility. They "urge the industrialized countries to assume full responsibility commensurate with their financial and technological resources to reverse the process of defacement of the environment."1 20 The industrialized nations, being richer as well as greater consumers, have the resources and the room for change.130 In contrast to the United States, many European countries have already taken measures to substantially reduce their emissions.' The US, the highest per capita consumer of food and energy In the world, should follow their lead and demonstrate its willingness to pay the price for the toll it takes on the international environment. At the same time, compliance withWHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER 17 NEPA when acting abroad would lend much integrity to US actions and decisions and would strengthen its "political and moral force by eliminating the double standard that honesty is warranted at home, but not abroad." 3 ' Where the absence of an EIS permits the export of environmentally unsound practices which have been prohibited or made subject to strict control domestically, the hypocrisy of the United States stands as a significant barrier in encouraging international environmental protection. Applying NEPA to those actions is an important step in the right direction.
In the military realm, there are other factors that are already driving the US and China towards greater strategic competition. China is developing capabilities that are aimed at denying the US Navy easy access in a crisis to its near seas - the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea - which occupy significant portions of the Western Pacific. From China's perspective this is a defensive strategy that is referred to in Chinese writings as aimed at "counter-intervention". The US views the development of these capabilities, which it terms "anti-access/area denial", as threatening its ability to protect its interests in the Asia-Pacific, including defending its allies. To ensure that it can maintain freedom of access and manoeuvre in the waters around China, the US is applying operational concepts such as Air-Sea Battle. Although this competition is already underway, the two countries are so far able to effectively isolate the military competition from the broader political and economic relationship. Even US-China military exchanges and joint exercises have increased despite their growing competition for sea control in the waters around China. However, if this competition becomes more intense, US-China cooperation in the Asia-Pacific may become impossible. And if China were to employ its anti-accès s/area-denial weapons to warn or intimidate the US, the US would likely respond, and tensions could escalate rapidly.
Nevertheless, half or more of the public in 33 of 44 nations surveyed still think that Washington safeguards Americans’ freedoms. The U.S. image as a protector of personal liberties remains quite strong in a number of Asian nations: South Korea (91%), Philippines (87%), Japan (84%) and Vietnam (75%); and also in the Middle East: Lebanon (84%) and Israel (75%). And in many societies, the younger generation is much more likely than their elders to see the U.S. as a defender of domestic liberties. This is particularly true in Uganda, where there is a 20-point generation gap on this measure, and Russia with a 19-point difference.
I heartily commend this well-crafted article on the unlikely evangelical-libertarian coalition that created the Right on Crime movement. David Dagan and Steven M. Teles appreciate that liberal organizations like the ACLU, the Open Societies Institute and the Public Welfare Foundation carried the torch for criminal justice reform during the dark ages (1980-2000) of tough-on-crime politic and ever-expanding prison populations. But liberal politicians have been too afraid of the soft-on-crime label to associate themselves with the reform movement; in fact, Democrats like Bill Clinton built careers on out-toughing the conservatives. Real political change required a bi-partisan approach, and this meant that the impetus for reform had to come from the political right. Democrats will vote for change, but only if conservatives give them political cover. Conservatives, especially in deep-red states like Texas, don’t have to worry about looking soft.
GOP leaders estimate that their proposal to end Saturday delivery of first-class mail would raise $10.7 billion over a decade – enough to extend the highway fund for as long as a year. They're quick to note that Obama included the postal reform provision in his latest budget blueprint.¶ "Given the limited window for action, we believe it is important that an offset be simple and have the support of the administration and congressional Republicans,” House GOP leaders wrote to members of their conference last month.¶ But Democrats are pushing back hard. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), head of the Budget Committee, said Tuesday that the GOP's strategy is "the wrong way to go."¶ Rep. Xavier Becerra (Calif.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said Republicans are playing a "zero-sum game" by eliminating one program, Saturday delivery, to fund another, highways.¶ "We don't have to pit one American against another to make the program work," he said. ¶ The Obama administration is pushing an alternative plan that fills the trust fund for four years, including annual increases funded by corporate tax hikes.
These theories fit the realities of state-to-state interaction differently region to region. It is often argued that the Middle East is best explained by the neo- realist or realist paradigm, due to the absence of strong institutions, the lack of a normative framework guiding the interaction of the Middle East states, and the Machiavellian nature of its politics.22 Furthermore, unlike the European system, the Middle East lacks a consensus on the hierarchy of states, in which states, by and large, only seek to increase their relative power through acceptable, non-military avenues and in which all states have accepted the dynamic of how role should be granted to rising states or withdrawn from declining states. No such order and normative framework exist in the Middle East. Many of its states are new to statecraft and the system has yet to reach equilibrium; in this case, neither the hierarchy for role nor relative power has been set-everything is up for grabs. There are almost as many would-be hegemons as there are states in the Middle East. Many states can be characterized as anti-status quo states that actively seek to keep their options open by undermining any possible equilibrium. In addition, the lack of a normative framework, i.e., an implicit agreement on the accepted rules of interaction and competition, creates an atmosphere in which states often resort to instigation of instability in neighboring states and support for terrorist groups and secessionist movements. In short, the gloves are always off in the Middle East. These factors all make the Middle East suitable for explanation through the power cycle theory. Doran's differentiation between power and role is essential for understanding the hegemonic driving forces of Middle E-,astern states. Furthermore, it explains why smaller states in the Middle East do not let their role aspirations be hampered by their moderate relative power shares, since relative power shares do not necessarily dictate role distribution. The power cycle theory. Charles Doran's theory puts decision-making about wars in the context of the rise and decline of the relative power of states. Doran argues that states follow a cyclical path of growth, maturation, and decline that mainly stems from uneven rates of internal economic development.23 According to Parasiliti, "power is an analytical construct-it is not a physical thing that can be directly measured."24
Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff’s recent indictment of the United States’ cyberspying practices has profound global repercussions for the U.S vision of a borderless, open Internet. What makes this backlash especially potent and lamentable is that it is being fueled not by democracies that oppose American ideals, but rather by allies that resent Washington’s betrayal of its own overarchingly positive vision. Advertisement Rouseff’s offensive to change Internet governance follows reports that the National Security Agency’s watchful eye could see as far as her Palácio do Planalto in Brasília. According to leaked documents, the United States has been surveilling Rousseff’s email, intercepting internal government communications, and spying on the country’s national oil company. After canceling an official visit to meet with President Obama in Washington, Rousseff took to the podium at the U.N.’s General Assembly to call on other countries to disconnect from U.S. Internet hegemony and develop their own sovereign Internet and governance structures. Rousseff’s move could lead to a powerful chorus—one that would transform the Internet of the future from a global commons to a fractured patchwork severely limited by the political boundaries on a map. Brazil is one of a handful of countries—including Indonesia, Turkey, and India—that have wavered in the debate over whether to develop an international framework to govern the Internet, one that would replace the role that the United States has played as chief Internet steward. Traditionally, that debate has featured America in the role as champion of a free and open Internet, one that guarantees the right of all people to freely express themselves. Arguing against that ideal: repressive regimes that have sought to limit connectivity and access to information. The NSA’s actions have shifted that debate, alienating key Internet-freedom allies and emboldening some of the most repressive regimes on the planet. Think of it as an emerging coalition between countries that object to how the United States is going about upholding its avowed principles for a free Internet, and countries that have objected to those avowed principles all along. Our close allies in the European Union, for instance, are now considering revoking data-sharing agreements with the United States and requiring American website providers to prominently warn Europeans that their data is subject to U.S. government surveillance. Meanwhile, repressive regimes like Iran, Syria, and China are wresting control of information over their networks, poisoning popular applications and services, and undermining the foundations for the Internet’s open, interconnected structure. NSA misdeeds undoubtedly further embolden these regimes to do as they please. The motivations of those nations questioning America’s de facto control over the global Internet may vary, but their responses are all pointing in the same troubling direction: toward a Balkanized Internet. Today, the Internet is in danger of becoming like the European train system, where varying voltage and 20 different types of signaling technologies force operators to stop and switch systems or even to another locomotive, resulting in delays, inefficiencies, and higher costs. Netizens would fall under a complex array of different jurisdictions imposing conflicting mandates and conferring conflicting rights. And much as different signaling hampers the movement of people and the trade of physical goods, an Internet within such a complex jurisdictional structure would certainly hamper modern economic activity. The NSA has opened a Pandora’s box that treats “citizens” and “foreigners” differently (even defining both groups in myriad different ways). Its rules also impose geo-locational-based jurisdictional mandates (based upon the route of your Internet traffic or the location of the data services and databases you use). They also include requirements based upon ownership; the location of a company’s headquarters may lead to surveillance mandates covering services and infrastructure in other countries. This creates tremendous technical challenges for startups and entrepreneurs—who will have to overcome impossible compatibility hurdles just to get up and running—stifling innovation at a moment when we need greater economic momentum, not dead weight. Already, a German citizen accessing a New York City data center via a Chinese fiber line may find her data covered by an array of conflicting legal requirements requiring privacy and active surveillance at the same time. Fracturing the Internet undermines Internet freedom as well. The basic principle at the heart of Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—protecting the right to freedom of opinion, expression, and the opportunity to participate in the information society—is at risk. Brazil may not be pressing to assert control over everything online or censor its own people, or spy on them, but plenty of other countries with darker motives are cheering Brazil on. The U.S. has done a disservice to all people already living and working under repressive regimes by creating a new international norm that massive-scale surveillance is acceptable. As others adopt the U.S. model, particularly in areas where movements for fundamental freedoms are burgeoning and fighting against oppression, there will be even less access to basic communications, hampering the ability to interact online outside of the regime’s control and censorship. Furthermore, the NSA has made a remarkably myopic tradeoff—overreaching its legal authorities for a slight boost in signals intelligence today that will lead to massive problems in response. Even before all the recent revelations of NSA misbehavior, the United States was already facing calls for a more “democratic” global system of Internet regulation that gave other countries more say in setting rules. Now, for the sake of a free Internet, it is imperative for Washington to move fast to restore a belief that America is a trustworthy Internet steward. It’s time for bold leadership to defend our core principles. Reforms need to go far beyond pro-forma reviews carried out by intelligence and administration insiders. There are precedents for the United States’ exercising restraint in order to advance larger interests. As a country, we agreed to stop atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, not to stockpile or deploy chemical weapons, and not to militarize outer space. There must be a cyberspace equivalent of this restraint—a restoration of balance that prioritizes civil rights, not surveillance, as vital to (inter)national security. Is the benefit of spying on Brazil’s oil company worth the cost of antagonizing the people of our hemisphere’s second-largest democracy and giving China and Russia the moral high ground in debates over how people around the world should access information? Do we really want a world where this behavior is normalized and where it’s acceptable for every country to surveil and hack indiscriminately? The answer to that question seems pretty clear. Today we need bold reforms from Washington—we need to curtail our unhealthy addiction to surveillance and covert hacking. Only by being radically transparent about the scope of current activities and ceasing activities that transgress national norms will we regain global trust and shift the rather bleak trajectory we are currently on.
Our inquiry is therefore more humble. Could a U.S. threat that it might interfere with a rogue state’s nuclear weapon delivery help shape a nuclear confrontation? For this question, assume a rogue nuclear power with a handful of weapons capable of hitting nearby countries (but generally incapable of hitting the continental United States). The United States has a robust cyberattack capability (in general terms), from which the rogue state’s nuclear arsenal is not provably immune. Although the United States enjoys escalation dominance, the rogue state is far more willing to go to the nuclear brink than the United States is. The rogue state (thinks it) has more at stake (i.e., regime survival). Furthermore, it may act in ways that are irrational by Western perspectives. We first model a two-state confrontation, then later introduce a friendly state on whose behalf the United States has intervened. The United States enters this scenario facing the choice of acting when doing so risks the rogue state releasing a nuclear weapon. Whether the threat is explicit or implicit is secondary. The usual calculus applies. The rogue state is better off if its threat leads the United States to stop. The United States is better off ignoring the threat and going ahead with what it would have done in the absence of the threat if the threat can be nullified but cannot know that it will be for certain. The rogue state understands that if it does use nuclear weapons, it could face great retaliation.1 If the United States acts (successfully) in the face of warning and if the rogue state does not use nuclear weapons, the United States achieves its objectives and wins the overall confrontation.2 If the United States flinches, the rogue state wins. If the rogue state uses its nuclear weapons and if, as is likely, the United States responds likewise, the rogue state loses greatly, but the United States is also far worse off.3 Two-Party Confrontations In a confrontation in which disaster would result from both sides carrying out their threats, each must ask: Are such threats credible? If one side thinks the other will yield, it pays to stand firm. If it thinks, however, that the other is implacable, it may have no good choice but to yield itself. The projection of implacability is beneficial, but the reality of implacability is frequently suicidal. Note that the basis for the implacability can also be entirely subjective, which is to say, unfounded on the facts of the matter. If one party is convinced that it will never pay a high price for being implacable, communicates as much, and acts as if it were so, the other cannot take any comfort from the fact that the first has no technical basis for the belief. The only consideration is whether the first party actually believes as much, is willing to act accordingly, and can ignore the logic that whispers that no one can possibly be completely confident on the basis of iffy information. To one party, the willingness to act on the basis of the impossible seems like cheating. To use an analogy, imagine a game of “chicken” in which the driver of one of the two oncoming cars throws the steering wheel out the window. This cheat forces the opponent to choose between a certain crash or veering away (and thus losing). However, when the consequences of a crash are far greater than the benefits of winning, this strategy is irrational if there is a nontrivial likelihood that the other side will be intent on punishing cheaters at the cost of all other values. In the analogy, the second driver might rather crash than lose to a cheater.4 But in general, a strategy of implacability, can, if credible, do well, as long as the other side is not equally implacable. So, the United States creates the belief (whether by saying so, hinting, or letting others draw their own conclusion) that the rogue state cannot carry out its nuclear threat. That is, the United States acts as though a flaw somewhere in the nuclear command-and-control cycle, probably an induced flaw, prevents immediate nuclear use. A lesser case is that the command and control is less certain, the weapon is weaker, and/or the delivery system is far less accurate than feared.5 Although permanently disabling a nuclear command-and-control system is quite a stretch for cyberwar, it is less fantastic to imagine that the United States could delay a weapon’s use. A temporary advantage, though, may still give the United States time to cross the red line and thereby attain a fait accompli. So posturing, the United States prepares to cross the red line, while communicating its confidence that the rogue state will not retaliate. This confidence stems from a combination of its own nuclear deterrence capability plus its ability to confound the rogue state’s nuclear capability: The rogue nuclear state probably will not decide to retaliate, and if it did decide to, probably cannot retaliate. The combination, in this case, is what reduces the odds of a nuclear response to a sufficiently low level, if the rogue state is at all rational. Even if it later assures itself and others that its nuclear capacity is intact, but the United States has already acted, the onus then falls on the rogue nuclear state to respond to what could well be a done deal. If the rogue state understands the logic before brandishing its own nuclear weapons, it may choose not to ratchet up tensions in advance of the U.S. crossing red lines.
The utility of space as a medium for war has grown exponentially since the days of the Cold War Space Race. The military potential of satellites is manifold: communications, navigation, early-warning systems, reconnaissance, and signal intelligence. Any state that manages to get the upper hand in this frontier can be expected to dominate the outcome of any war. A state with command over space-based assets can jam enemy satellites or destroy them, and stop the enemy from communicating with troops or accessing vital information about troop movements or incoming missiles. It is in this context that the events in India’s neighborhood have caused anxiety and have led to calls for a new space policy aimed at countering the growing might of China’s space military program. Threats From China’s Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Program According to some reports, Beijing conducted its latest anti-satellite missile test in 2013, when it launched its new ASAT (anti-satellite) missile, the Dong Neng-2 or DN-2. A U.S. defense official familiar with military intelligence, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the DN-2 as a “ground-based, high earth-orbit attack missile.” Further, a report by the Secure World Foundation stated that “while there is no conclusive proof, the available evidence strongly suggests that China’s May 2013 launch was the test of the rocket component of a new direct ascent ASAT weapons system derived from a road-mobile ballistic missile.” This was not the first time Beijing tested its ASAT program. A more prominent test occurred in January 2007, when the Chinese military launched a KT-1 rocket that successfully destroyed a redundant Chinese Feng Yun 1-C weather satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), approximately 800 kilometers above the Earth. The test left behind approximately 2,500 to 3,000 pieces of dangerous debris in LEO, where reconnaissance and weather satellites and manned space missions are vulnerable to space debris. In May 2013, a Russian satellite was struck and destroyed, reportedly by one such piece of debris. Hazardous space debris aside, the test also confirmed China’s capability to attack and destroy enemy satellites in the event of war, sabotaging the enemy’s military operations. Such developments have not gone unnoticed in New Delhi’s defense establishment. Security experts and scholars have called for a rethink of India’s space policy, augmenting India’s ASAT weapons capability. Following China’s 2007 ASAT weapons test, the then-chief of army staff of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor, was quoted in a Times of India report saying that China’s space program was expanding at an “exponentially rapid” pace in both offensive and defensive capabilities, and that space was becoming the “ultimate military high ground” to dominate in the wars of the future. Then-Integrated Defense Staff Chief Lt. General H S Lidder was also quoted as saying, “with time, we will get sucked into the military race to protect space assets and inevitably there will be a military contest in space. In a life-and-death scenario, space will provide the advantage.” A breakthrough emerged in 2012 when V.K. Saraswat, then the chief of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), India’s premier defense R&D organization, announced that India has all the building blocks in place to integrate an anti-satellite weapon to neutralize hostile satellites in low earth and polar orbits. In an interview, Saraswat suggested that India’s anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defense program could be utilized as an ASAT weapon, along with its Agni series of missiles. This was corroborated by DRDO, which said that the Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program can incorporate anti-satellite weapon development. It should also be remembered that with the recent successes of its Mars mission and the geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV-D5), the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) now has the capability to launch satellites weighing in excess of two tons, an important prerequisite for the deployment of any weapons system. And while existing space treaties prohibit placing weapons of mass destruction in space, they do not explicitly prohibit the placing of other types of weapons. For DRDO then, the next goal would likely be todevelop orbital weapons, which could remain in space for as long as required while orbiting Earth or the Moon. Does India Really Have an ASAT Weapons Capability? While the statements by V.K. Saraswat created ripples all over, at home his statements were dismissed by certain scholars as an exaggeration. Questioning India’s “purported” capabilities, scholars like Michael Listner and Victoria Samson have pointed out that without conducting a test and demonstrating its ASAT capability explicitly, India will only be seen as a “paper tiger” by the arms control and intelligence community. Listner pointed out that the acknowledgement by Saraswat about India developing and bringing together the basic technologies to create a system that could be used against enemy satellites, and the decision to adapt India’s ABM technology for an ASAT role was “doubtless encouraged by the ancillary capability demonstrated by the United States when it adapted its ABM system to deorbit USA 193 in 2008.” But should such ancillary capability be taken as a evidence of full ASAT capability? Expressing perplexity over contradictory statements from Indian officials, and their refusal to clear the air about India’s ASAT program, Listner states that public statements about India’s purported ASAT capability seem to “fit neither an active program to develop an ASAT or an ancillary capability to ballistic missile defense.” However, in 2011, Bharath Gopalaswamy, who was then a researcher in the Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, claimed that India’s scientific community is open to an ASAT test, if it was done with caution. Rajeswari Rajagopalan, senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi based think tank, said that “India might do an ASAT test in the next five to 10 years.” While these statements are illuminating as to the going-ons in India’s academic and scientific circles, actually testing India’s purported ASAT capacity is easier said than done. As pointed out by Arvind Kumar, professor of Geopolitics and International Relations at Manipal University, ASAT capabilities require a number of technologies related to space-based sensors, synthetic aperture radars, electronics, a sound navigation system, guidance and control, and global positioning systems. A number of different types of sensors, including infrared sensors, optical sensors, electronic-optical sensors, and magnetic sensors are vital to monitor, detect, and help in sensing the events. Whether India has the ability to acquire or build these technologies is doubtful. The Case for ASAT Weapons Demonstration The questions raised over India’s ASAT weapons capacity are doubtless important. Even if New Delhi does have an anti-satellite weapons capability, it will only be acknowledged if it comes out in the open with a successful test. But such a demonstration will come with its own costs. What would be the consequences if New Delhi decided to demonstrate its purported ASAT capability? It should be remembered that along with causing grave insecurity, and possibly a space-weaponization race in the region, such a test will also lead to the creation of hazardous space debris, which could doubtless elicit international opprobrium, and possibly even sanctions. Burgeoning relations with the United States — which even led to the signing of the 2005 India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement and made India the first country with nuclear weapons which is not a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), but still allowed to carry out nuclear commerce with a nuclear weapons state — could end in jeopardy if India unilaterally tests ASAT weapons. Further, at a time when India is looking at the indigenization of its defense industry to cut the costs of importing weapons (India is the world’s largest arms importer) and hoping to garner international investments in its defense and manufacturing industry, such a move could stall such developments as investors would see the tests as a sign of aggression and defiance of international norms. Additionally, for India to establish its defense-industrial base, it needs the transfer of technology from technologically advanced nations. If New Delhi decides to go ahead with ASAT tests, it will possibly be looking at sanctions, not tech transfers.
Significant challenges to offshore wind power deployment related to resource characterization, grid interconnection and operation, and infrastructure will need to be overcome. The offshore wind resource is not well characterized. This significantly increases uncertainty related to potential project power production and turbine and array design considerations, which in turn increase financing costs. The implications for adding large amounts of offshore wind generation to the power system need to be better understood to ensure reliable integration and to evaluate the need for additional grid infrastructure such as an offshore transmission backbone. Finally, with current technology, cost ‐ effective installation of offshore wind turbines requires specialized vessels, purpose ‐ built portside infrastructure, robust undersea electricity transmission lines, and grid interconnections. These vessels and this infrastructure do not currently exist in the U.S. Although foreign ‐ flagged turbine installation and maintenance vessels exist, legislation such as the Jones Act limits the ability of these vessels to operate in U.S. waters.
Under the framework of the Merida Initiative, the U.S. government has funneled billions of dollars into Mexico with the stated intent “to fight organized crime and associated violence while furthering respect for human rights and the rule of law.” Launched in 2007, the initiative is formally focused on (1) disrupting organized criminal groups, (2) institutionalizing the rule of law, (3) creating a 21st-century border, and (4) building strong and resilient communities in Mexico. According to a January 2016 report by the Congressional Research Service, “Newer areas of focus have involved bolstering security along Mexico’s southern border and addressing the production and trafficking of heroin in Mexico.”15 Most of the $2.1 billion of military and police assistance to Mexico since 2008 has been counter-drug equipment and training for Mexican police agencies, including $590 million worth of aircraft. In addition to U.S. grant assistance to Mexico, most of which is channeled to U.S. companies, the United States has also approved the transfer through sales of billions of dollars’ worth of other arms to the Mexican government. According to The Washington Post, the value of weapons and military equipment sold was $3.5 billion from 2012 to 2015 and included firearms, armored vehicles, helicopters, and other military aircraft.16 “We didn’t sell them just the helicopters,” a former Pentagon official on Mexico policy told The New York Times. “We sold them 15 years of working intimately together that we would not otherwise have.”17 Whatever the pretext or mode of delivery, the evidence is strong that such U.S. military transfers contribute significantly to violence, instability, and the denial of human rights. Because of the depth of corruption in the Mexican government, police and armed forces blur the lines between official groups and criminals, and legal arms sales frequently end up arming criminal gangs and criminal conduct directly. Moreover, the Mexican police and military have a long history of repression against mostly peaceful social movements. In 2013 alone, the United States exported to Mexico 5,810 revolvers and pistols, 7,223 rifles, 30 assault rifles, 1,311 machine guns, 7,145 shotguns, 34 grenade launchers, and 20 anti-tank missile launchers, according to data reported to the United Nations. Among these weapons were U.S.-produced and exported rifles used by the police who attacked and handed over 43 student teachers from Ayotzinapa to a local criminal gang in September 2014. Documents from the Mexican defense ministry’s arms registry include the weapons possessed by municipal police in Iguala, who carried out the crime. Among the arms listed: 20 assault rifles produced by Colt’s Manufacturing, headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut. Colt sold the Mexican government those rifles, which arrived in Guerrero in 2013.18 U.S. Embassy staff assured us that police who are shown to have committed grave human rights abuses are barred from receiving U.S. training. But the restriction apparently does not apply to police receiving U.S.-exported weapons. An increasing amount of arms sales to Mexico are made directly by the United States government, through its Foreign Military Sales program, rather than in commercial transactions with the producers, known as Direct Commercial Sales, even though those producers still profit from the sales. These governmental sales do not count the assault rifles and other firearms sold at retail stores and gun shows in the United States and smuggled into Mexico. Paulina Arriaga, executive director of Desarma Mexico (desarmamexico.org), told us that  one can’t talk about arms in Mexico without talking about the United States. For example, the end of the assault weapons ban in 2004 provoked a spike in the presence of such weapons in Mexico.19 Seventy percent of firearms seized in criminal investigations in Mexico come from the U.S., according to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. In fact, Arriaga says the U.S. is “without a doubt the primary provider of legal and illegal arms in Mexico.” Those weapons contributed to some 65 percent of the nearly 15 million “common crimes” committed in Mexico from 2011 to 2013, and roughly 56 percent of the 57,000 homicides committed since 2013. Of the U.S.-sourced guns seized by authorities at crime scenes in Mexico, up to a half of them were imported into the United States from other nations, according to a Violence Policy Center report. If the United States restricted imports of assault weapons, it could reduce the flow of such weapons to Mexico, even without a full U.S. legislative ban on the sale of assault weapons.20 While the United States has the biggest external role in Mexico’s militarization, other countries also contribute to and benefit from it, including Spain, the Netherlands, France, Canada, and Germany. In the display showcases that we saw at the Mexican Secretary of National Defense (SEDENA), guns manufactured by companies from the United States,21 Israel,22 Italy, Slovakia, China, and the Czech Republic are offered to private security companies and federal, state, and local police forces shopping for weapons. German arms sales to Mexico demonstrate both how exported arms are used in atrocities and how exporting states can seek to exercise controls. The German firm Heckler and Koch sold nearly tenthousand G-36 assault rifles to Mexico between 2006 and 2009, on the condition that they not send them to the conflictive states of Chihuahua, Guerrero, Jalisco, and Chiapas. Yet dozens of the rifles were recovered from the Iguala municipal police who participated in the disappearance of the 43 Ayotzinapa students in September 2014. In response, German prosecutors charged six Heckler and Koch employees with criminal violations, and German officials visited Mexico to request forgiveness of family members of the Ayotzinapa students.
China’s economy stabilized last quarter and gathered pace in March as a surge in new credit spurred a property sector rebound while raising fresh questions over the sustainability of the debt-fueled expansion. Gross domestic product rose 6.7 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, meeting the median projection of economists surveyed by Bloomberg and in line with the government’s growth target of 6.5 percent to 7 percent for the full year. New credit, industrial output, fixed-asset investment and retail sales picked up in March and beat analysts’ forecasts. Signs of stabilization in the world’s second-biggest economy and bets on a subdued pace of U.S. monetary tightening have helped lead to recent rallies in oil, metals and global equities. Surging credit in March now shifts concern back to the durability of the recovery, how much financing is propping up zombie companies, and whether the market-driven reforms needed to boost new growth drivers will quicken. “The economy has stabilized thanks to a flood of liquidity and improved sentiment in the property market,” said Tao Dong, head of Asia economics excluding Japan at Credit Suisse Group AG in Hong Kong. “It is not clear whether the momentum is sustainable. So far, the government seems to be the solo singer. It is critical to re-engage private investment.” Aggregate financing was 2.34 trillion yuan ($360.7 billion) in March, the People’s Bank of China said, as monetary easing filtered through the financial system. Quarter-on-quarter growth in the first three months of this year was more than double the pace during the prior period, said Tim Condon, head of Asian research at ING Groep NV in Singapore.
This article argues that the structural drivers of U.S.-China competition are too deep to resolve through cooperative engagement and that policymakers must instead accept the reality of strategic rivalry and aim to manage it at a lower level of intensity. main argument Rising tensions between China and the U.S. have spurred fears that the two countries could end up in conflict or recreate the Cold War. To avoid these outcomes, analysts have proposed ways to defuse competition and promote cooperation. However, because these arguments do not address the structural drivers underpinning U.S.-China competition, such proposals are unlikely to end the rivalry. Conflict is not inevitable, however, and aggressive strategies that unnecessarily aggravate the sources of rivalry are likely to prove dangerously counterproductive. The best option at this point is, paradoxically, for the U.S. to accept the reality of the growing strategic rivalry and manage it at a lower level of intensity. policy implications • Maintaining a technological edge is critical for the U.S. to successfully manage the rivalry with China. Policies should be pursued to ensure that the U.S. continues to attract and nurture the best science and technology talent and retains its status as the global leader in technology. • To compete with China’s narrative about leading regional integration, the U.S. should both put forth a compelling vision for the region that encompasses widely held economic, security, and political values and continue to bolster its diplomatic and military positions in Asia. • To maintain the U.S.-China rivalry at a stable level, policymakers in both countries should prioritize measures that discourage the mobilization of popular sentiment against the other country and encourage cultural exchanges. • U.S.-China competition will likely become increasingly entwined with rivalries between China and U.S. allies and partners such as Japan and India. U.S. policymakers will need to take into account the independent dynamics of those separate rivalries when managing relations with China. The United States and China find themselves increasingly enmeshed in a strategic rivalry, the basic nature of which remains poorly understood in the United States. To be sure, disagreements between the two countries have gained widespread attention. Disputes involving Chinese confrontations with U.S. allies and partners such as Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan have frequently grabbed the headlines. At other times, disagreements over Chinese trade practices and U.S. military activities in the South China Sea have occasioned discord. All these sources of conflict are genuine, but they mask the main drivers of rivalry, which are twofold. First, the United States and China are locked in a contest for primacy—most clearly in Asia and probably globally as well. The United States has been the dominant power, and China seeks to eventually supplant it. By definition, two different states cannot simultaneously share primacy at either the regional or global level. Second, economic, demographic, and military trajectories suggest that China has the potential to contend in a significant way for leadership at the global systemic level. At this level, the most decisive competition will be for technological leadership. Should China supplant the United States as the world’s premier country in terms of technology, its claim to regional and global supremacy will be difficult to deny. And once it has gained that supremacy, China will be well positioned to restructure institutional arrangements to privilege itself and disadvantage the United States. Although this competition is occurring simultaneously at both levels, observers have focused primarily on the struggle for primacy at the regional level and overlooked or downplayed the competition at the global systemic level.1 To counter China’s pursuit of regional primacy, the United States has bolstered its alliances in Asia (albeit inconsistently), expanded diplomatic outreach to China and rising powers in Southeast Asia, and revised its military posture—efforts captured by President Barack Obama’s “rebalance to Asia.” President Donald Trump may have abandoned the rebalance, but many of the related initiatives remain more or less in place.2 China’s challenge at the global systemic level, especially in the field of technology, has received less attention. Confidence in the proven U.S. ability to produce new technologies and facile assumptions about the difficulties China will face in promoting innovation in new industries have led many to dismiss the challenge posed by China. But the contest for technological leadership is actually even more consequential than that for regional primacy. Should China succeed in surpassing the United States as the world’s technological leader, U.S. diplomacy and military power will not suffice to hold the line either in Asia or around the globe. Under those conditions, countries throughout the world, including U.S. allies in Asia, will be forced to come to terms with the new leading economy. Military power projection could be far less relevant as China moves to consolidate its leading status at both the regional and global levels in such a scenario. Accordingly, although the United States cannot abandon its efforts to bolster its diplomatic and military position in Asia, the country must step up its efforts to strengthen its faltering lead in new technology development. While China clearly grasps the stakes, it is not clear that the United States does. For example, China’s government has promoted R&D into quantum computing. The investment appears to be paying off, as the country has leaped ahead of the United States in developing quantum communications.3 Similarly, the U.S. Congress has proposed to dispense with subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles, even as China pushes ahead in its plan to become the lead producer of this technology.4 And while the U.S. government seeks to restrict immigration and discourage foreign students from attending U.S. universities (and staying after they receive their advanced training), China has revised its policies to welcome foreigners, prioritizing those with science and technology expertise. Moreover, Chinese investment in basic R&D is rapidly catching up to that of the United States.5 Studies have also noted a shrinking U.S. lead in science and technology as such investment is beginning to bear fruit.6 Similarly, the United States has lost its once-undisputed lead in the per capita number of engineers and scientists.7 Understanding the nature of the U.S.-China rivalry at the regional and global systemic levels, as well as how these two levels interact with one another, is essential if the United States is to successfully manage the challenge posed by China in a manner that avoids war. This study aims to contribute to that understanding. The article is organized into the following sections: u pp. 95–102 provide an overview of the growing rivalry between China and the United States, including a discussion of the meaning and role of strategic rivalry in interstate conflict and a comparison with the U.S.-China rivalry during the Cold War. u pp. 102–4 review the dynamics of the rivalry at the regional systemic level. u pp. 104–10 analyze the dynamics of the rivalry at the global systemic level. u pp. 110–15 examine why proposals to avoid rivalry through cooperation or aggressive competition are unlikely to succeed. u pp. 115–19 discuss the idea of strategic rivalry management and offer recommendations on ways to sustain the rivalry at a lower level of intensity the growing rivalry between the united states and china Strains between China and the United States have deepened in the past few years over a proliferating array of issues. President Trump has stepped up accusations against China of unfair trade practices and inadequate pressure on North Korea. He also provoked controversy early in his term when he floated the idea of increasing official contacts with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province.8 These disputes add to tensions that had expanded under President Obama, who moved to strengthen U.S. alliances in Asia, promote a regional trade pact, criticize Chinese behavior in the cyber and maritime domains, and shift more military assets to the Asia-Pacific as part of the rebalance to Asia strategy.9 China has in turn dismissed U.S. concerns about the construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea, intensified its criticism of U.S. security leadership in Asia, and tightened its grip on disputed maritime territories.10 The baleful state of bilateral relations has spurred plenty of finger-pointing. On the Chinese side, officials denounce the United States’ “Cold War mindset” and warn of conflict if Washington does not adjust its policies.11 A 2015 defense white paper described an “intensifying competition” between the great powers.12 Military officials and many Chinese analysts regard increasing tension between the two countries as unavoidable, although they do not regard war as likely. People’s Liberation Army (PLA) deputy chief of staff Qi Jianguo commented that “no conflict and no confrontation does not mean no struggle” between China and the United States.13 According to Chinese official media, polls in China suggest a large majority believes that the United States intends to pursue a containment policy.14 Reflecting this point of view, Niu Xinchun, a scholar at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, argued that the “greatest obstacle to the further integration of emerging countries such as China into the international system comes from the United States.”15 Western officials and commentators tend to blame China for current strains. Senior U.S. leaders have criticized “assertive” Chinese behavior, while some analysts blame Xi Jinping for pushing a more confrontational set of policies.16 Other Western observers worry that a further souring of relations could lead to conflict.17 But even if war remains unlikely, the deepening tensions increase the risks of miscalculation, crises, and potential military clashes involving the world’s two largest powers. Echoing a view widely held among U.S. foreign policy experts and officials, former CIA director General Michael Hayden has warned that mishandling the U.S.-China relationship could be “catastrophic.”18 Rivalry at the Heart of the U.S.-China Relationship This widespread concern reflects a realistic appraisal of the dangers inherent in the U.S.-China relationship. But developing successful policies to manage an increasingly sensitive and complex situation requires an accurate assessment of the phenomenon of interstate rivalry that lies at the heart of that relationship. Rivalry is a concept that, while widely acknowledged, remains poorly understood. To be sure, most experts take for granted the idea that powerful nations compete for status and influence, and they acknowledge the danger posed by a rising power’s challenge to a status quo power. Yet investigation into the phenomenon of rivalry too often stops at these well-trodden findings. Less often discussed are the conclusions regarding the dynamics of rivalry that experts on conflict studies have arrived at within the past few years. Much of this scholarship draws from improvements to the analyses and data regarding interstate crisis and conflict.19 This research has generated useful and interesting insights regarding the start and conclusion of rivalries, crises, and war, although these remain largely unexplored outside academic circles. Analysts have established, for example, that rivalry is perhaps the most important driver of interstate conflict. As defined by political scientists, “rivals” are states that regard each other as “enemies,” sources of real or potential threat, and as competitors. At the root of rivalries thus lie disputes over incompatible goals and perceptions that countries possess both the ability (real or potential) and the intention to harm each other. Wars have historically tended to be fought by pairings of these states and their allies. Rivals have opposed each other in 77% of wars since 1816 and in over 90% of wars since 1945.20 Not only are rivals more likely to fight than non-rivals, but rivals also have a tendency to be recidivists because they are unable to resolve their political differences on the battlefield. Yet that does not always discourage them from trying to do so repeatedly. Rivals that cannot prevail due to parity frequently compete for advantage by building internal strength through arms racing or by leveraging external power through the strengthening of alliances and partnerships. Rivals are also prone to serial militarized crises. Mutual perceptions of each other as hostile enemies and the inconclusive outcome of previous militarized disputes typically fuel a pattern of recurrent crises characterized by deepening resentment, distrust, and growing willingness to risk escalation. Studies have also established that the risk of conflict increases sharply after three episodes of militarized crises.21 Rivalries do not progress in a linear direction, however. Their intensity can wax and wane in response to shocks and other important developments. Periods of relative stability can alternate with turbulent periods of tension and conflict. Similarly, cooperative activities can be interspersed with periods of acute tension and hostility. Nevertheless, the link between rivalry, crises, and interstate conflict is pervasive. Drawing from these sources, one can describe the Sino-U.S. relationship as a rivalry characterized as a competition between two major powers over incompatible goals regarding their status, leadership, and influence over a particular region—in this case principally the Asia-Pacific. The dynamics of this type of strategic rivalry differ in significant ways from the far more numerous rivalries over territory that have characterized conflict between so many countries, especially weaker and poorer ones. In contrast with rivalries over territories, strategic rivals do not necessarily share borders, although allies of one power may be engaged in a territorial dispute with the other major power. Strategic rivalries among major powers tend to be especially long-lived, with the average enduring for about 55 years.22 Strategic rivalries are incredibly complex phenomena that include overlapping and often reinforcing layers of disputes over leadership, status, and territory between the principal rivals and their allies. Such rivalries are almost always multilateral affairs that also involve allies and partners, some of which have their own rivalries with the other side. Competition in the economic, political, and military domains can serve as expressions as well as drivers of rivalry, as can sports and cultural competition. Strategic rivalries can be confined to one region, with the basic conflict reducible in some respects to which rival will occupy the top rung of the regional hierarchy. In other cases, however, a rivalry can span regional and global domains either sequentially or simultaneously. The U.S.-China rivalry, for instance, is already both a regional and, to a lesser extent, a global rivalry, but there is still considerable room for competition to expand. The complex and overlapping nature of the disputes makes strategic rivalries extremely crisis- and conflict-prone. Strategic rivalries come in a grim package deal that includes strained and hostile relations, serial crises, and in some cases wars. The comprehensive and multifaceted nature of the disputes also explains why such rivalries have proved so durable and why their wars have been so devastating. Conflict between strategic rivals has historically occasioned the most destructive wars, of which World Wars I and II are the most recent examples. The fact that experts at the time of each historic episode of systemic conflict consistently underestimated the duration or extent of war offers cold comfort to analysts today who seek to predict the trajectory of any conflict that might involve China and the United States. Comparisons of the Current Environment with the U.S.-China Rivalry during the Cold War How did the two countries arrive at this position? The most widely accepted narrative argues that China’s rapid economic growth has provided the resources with which it can press demands on long unresolved issues such as unification with Taiwan. China and the United States may have enjoyed stable relations in the 1980s when they cooperated on a limited basis against the Soviet Union, but that foundation of cooperation eroded considerably once the Soviet bloc dissolved in the early 1990s. Moreover, China’s rapid growth in economic power has given the country fresh resources to press its own demands on the United States and U.S. allies. By 2010, China’s economy had outpaced that of Japan to become the second-largest in the world.23 The persistence of long-standing sources of antagonism, such as the U.S. security partnership with Taiwan, has both reflected and aggravated a broader competition for leadership. For its own reasons, Washington has resisted Beijing’s demands, and the result has been growing fear and distrust.24 The intensifying rivalry between the rising power and the status quo leader is as old as antiquity itself. Indeed, Graham Allison coined the term “Thucydides trap” to describe such a situation, a term that he subsequently applied to the current U.S.-China situation.25 The popular narrative is not entirely incorrect, yet in some ways it remains incomplete. A closer look at history reminds us that antagonism between China and the United States is not unprecedented. In the 1950s and 1960s, the two countries engaged in an intense strategic competition for status and influence in Asia, one that occasionally burned hot, as it did when they clashed on the Korean Peninsula or more indirectly in Vietnam. This Cold War–era rivalry saw a complex network of competing alliances and partnerships, principally in Asia. The United States supported Taiwan and South Korea in bitter disputes with China and its allies, North Korea and the Soviet Union. This rivalry terminated in the 1970s primarily due to Beijing’s decision to counter a growing Soviet menace and the United States’ decision to pursue China as a potential partner for its own rivalry with the Soviet Union. But the existence of a period of intense U.S.-Chinese tension and competition provides a helpful baseline of comparison. What requires explanation is not the fact that the United States and China are engaged in a rivalry but the difference between today’s rivalry and that of the Cold War. What distinguishes the rivalry today from that of the earlier period is both the closer parity in relative power—albeit still more potential than real—between the two countries and the comprehensiveness, complexity, and systemic nature of the disputes between them. Paradoxically, these features make the current rivalry potentially far more threatening to the United States, despite the fact that so far U.S.-China relations have remained peaceful, and even though the U.S. and Chinese militaries fought each other in the Korean War. The dangerous potential of the current rivalry ultimately owes to the risk that China could rise to the position of global system leader and subordinate the United States accordingly. As has happened in previous power transitions, China as a system leader could exploit existing arrangements to its benefit and to the detriment of the outgoing leader, the United States. Due to the enormous rewards that accrue to a systemic leader and the high costs for the state that loses this position, struggles for global leadership have historically proved to be especially destructive. The possibility that China and the United States could find themselves in a similar struggle, while unlikely at this point, cannot be ruled out given the reality of the relative decline in U.S. power and the concomitant increase in Chinese comprehensive national power. At the most basic level, this fact may be measured superficially by the U.S. share of world GDP, which eroded from 40% in 1950 to 16% in 2014, adjusted for purchasing power parity. Over the same period, China’s share expanded from around 5% to 17%.26 An important consequence of the narrowing of the gap in comprehensive power has been an intensifying competition for leadership in the international economic and political order. In this way, the popular discussion of the Thucydides trap correctly recognizes the dangers of the U.S.-China competition. This feature contrasts sharply with the previous episode of rivalry. In the 1950s and 1960s, the asymmetry in power meant that the United States and China competed for influence and even clashed militarily in countries along China’s borders, but rarely elsewhere. As a largely rural, impoverished country, China had little stake in the system of global trade promoted by the industrialized West. Excluded from the United Nations, Maoist China also lacked the institutional ability to influence geopolitics and project power much beyond its immediate environs—and even that capability was sorely handicapped. Outside Asia, the United States faced minimal competition from China and generally regarded the Soviet Union as a more pressing threat. By contrast, the current competition features a China fully enmeshed in a political and economic order led by the United States. While generally supportive of this order, China is also seeking to revise aspects of the regional and international order that it regards as obstacles to the country’s revitalization as a great power. The main theater of this competition for influence and leadership is the Asia-Pacific, as it was in the Cold War, but U.S.-China rivalry increasingly is expanding globally. Moreover, unlike the largely military, regional, and ideological Cold War competition, the current contest is far more multifaceted and comprehensive in nature; it includes military, economic, technological, and political dimensions. The following two sections review the state of the competition at both the regional and the global systemic levels. the u.s.-china rivalry at the regional level At the regional level, U.S.-China competition spans the political, economic, and military realms. Politically, the two countries have feuded over the role of liberal values and ideals, a dispute that widened after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. However, the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis elevated the potential threat of conflict between the two countries and may therefore be regarded as the starting point of the current rivalry. Coinciding with impressive gains in China’s economic and military power following two decades of market reforms, the standoff saw Washington and Beijing deploy military assets to back up their respective positions regarding Taiwan’s right to hold a presidential election, elevating the risk of a clash. Since then, the competition for political influence and leadership has intensified. In 2011, the United States announced its rebalance to Asia, which was aimed in part at shoring up U.S. alliances, partnerships, and influence.27 Although on the surface Washington has abandoned the effort, the Trump administration has reintroduced a vision for Asia’s economic and security order premised on values favorable to U.S. interests.28 The 2017 National Security Strategy stated, for example, that the United States upholds a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”29 Beijing, by contrast, has increased its efforts to advance a vision for a regional order premised on Chinese leadership. In recent years, China has promoted major economic and geostrategic initiatives to deepen Asia’s economic integration through the Belt and Road Initiative, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and other initiatives.30 In 2017, China for the first time issued a white paper that outlined the government’s vision for Asia-Pacific security. The paper stated that China takes the advancement of regional prosperity and stability “as its own responsibility.”31 These policies build on directives issued by Xi Jinping in 2013, when he called for policies to bolster China’s attractiveness as a regional leader.32 Economically, the two countries are competing over the evolution of Asia’s economic future—a region anticipated to drive global growth in coming decades. Both countries are also competing to shape the terms of trade. President Trump may have abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), but his advisers have advocated other measures to shape favorable trade terms.33 Meanwhile, China has stepped up advocacy of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a proposed free trade agreement for the region that excludes the United States.34 China also has promoted the AIIB, while the United States and Japan continue to instead support the Asian Development Bank.35 Militarily, the growing arms race and the establishment of rival security institutions stand among the most obvious manifestations of an increasing competition in this domain. China and the United States have designed an array of military capabilities and doctrines partly aimed at each other. The PLA has developed weapons systems to counter potential U.S. intervention in any contingency along China’s periphery, which the United States has in turn sought to counter with its own innovations, such as the Joint Operational Access Concept.36 U.S. secretaries of defense Chuck Hagel and Ashton Carter outlined a “third offset” strategy to compete with China and Russia in military technology.37 To promote regional security, the United States has strengthened its military alliances and partnerships, while China has strengthened ties with Russia and argued that regional security is best protected through the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia, and other Chinese-led institutions. In 2014, Xi indirectly rebuked the United States for seeking to bolster its security leadership in the region, stating that “it is for the people of Asia to uphold the security of Asia.”38 The regional rivalry has grown increasingly multilateral as well. China’s intensifying disputes over sovereignty and territory with its neighbors have encouraged those countries to strengthen their relations with the United States, further complicating the balance of power. In particular, the U.S.-China strategic rivalry overlaps with an even more antagonistic competition between China and Japan over a broad array of issues, including the territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands.39 At times, Vietnam and the Philippines have sought closer security relations with the United States as their disputes with China in the South China Sea have intensified. In a 2014 interview, Major General Qian Lihua, then director of foreign affairs in the Chinese Ministry of Defense, listed China’s principal threats as disputes over sovereignty and territorial rights and “hot spots” along the country’s periphery. These were followed by the “strategic adjustments” of the United States and Japan, as well as the strengthening of alliance relations, which he described as “adding strategic pressure” on China.40 the u.s.-china rivalry at the global systemic level At the global systemic level, the narrowing gap in comprehensive national power underpins a proliferating array of potential disputes across political, economic, and military issues. Politically, China has stepped up its criticism of U.S. international leadership and called for new political principles and values to guide government-to-government interactions. Xi has declared that the five basic principles of peaceful coexistence should become the “basic norms governing international relations” as well as “basic principles of international law.”41 In 2014, Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that the main obstacles to promoting international rule of law rested with countries that practiced “hegemonism, power politics and all forms of ‘new interventionism’”—a thinly veiled reference to the United States. He sharply criticized unnamed countries for adopting a “double-standard approach to international law, using whatever…suits their interests and abandoning whatever…does not.”42 In the competition for leadership at the global level, the critical contest does not concern which country possesses the largest economy, the most powerful military, or even the most “soft power,” although all of these competitions are important. Between the two large and powerful countries, the decisive issue is which country controls the most technologically proficient economy. The Importance of Technological Leadership A half century of social science on precedents in which rising powers competed with system leaders underscores the importance of the quality of economic leadership—evaluated primarily in terms of dominance in technology and energy—over quantity of economic output or other variables.43 Why is technological predominance so important? The first, most fundamental reason is that long-term economic growth is predicated on generating radical new technologies (new products, methods of production, markets, trade routes, fuel sources, and commercial organizations à la Joseph Schumpeter’s intermittent bouts of creative destruction). Whichever economy masters these new technologies first profits most from its pioneering innovations. In due time, the world economy’s leading innovator is likely to extend its lead to commercial, financial, and military areas as well. Ultimately the leading economy can shape the global economy according to its own preferences and advantage. Second, mastering surges in new technologies thus means that the leading economy—i.e., the country with the most technologically innovative economy—maintains the most competitive and lucrative position in the global economy. But it also means that technological superiority is transferred between the military and civilian economies. Gains made in military technology can be transferred to the civilian economy, and gains made in the civilian economy can be transferred to military technology. Examples of the former may be seen in the transfer of radar technology from the military to the civilian sector, while an example of the latter can be seen in the way basic research at universities has traditionally fueled advances in weapons technologies. The country with the leading economy thus is well positioned to also field the most technologically advanced military. As a consequence, it is likely to develop a command of the global commons and, for a period of time, unrivaled global reach. Third, technological predominance generates huge economic gains because corporations in the leading economy are set up to dominate new markets in the new industries. The expansion of commercial activity abroad to exploit new markets means that technological leaders profit enormously from a functioning and stable world economy, and are thus well positioned to provide global military and political leadership. A vivid example of this may be seen in the expansion of U.S. multinational corporations in the twentieth century, which fueled the need for a large military force that could police trade routes and the global commons to keep the world economy operating as smoothly as possible. The global presence of U.S. companies and military forces provided a strong incentive for U.S. leaders to focus on solving global issues. It also encouraged countries around the world to look to the United States as a leader, since it alone had the resources and reach to address global problems. Finally, a fourth reason technological predominance matters is that it fuels the soft power that makes the leading economy attractive. People around the world tend to admire and emulate the wonders of new technology as manifested in a vibrant and sophisticated economy. The media reinforces the appeal of the leading economy by delivering messages about how citizens in that country employ new technologies to enhance their quality of life. The technological superiority of the leading economy also yields soft power because the country’s political and military advantages allow it to exercise influence at levels unattainable by other countries. Technological predominance cannot deliver legitimacy, however, and thus a country with attractive political and cultural values and ideals will be better positioned to maintain its influence than one that relies heavily on coercion, such as today’s authoritarian China. But the main point remains: technological predominance opens opportunities for a country to increase its soft power. The importance of technological leadership means that the popular focus on the quantity of China’s economic output as the key index of national power is in many ways insufficient. China, after all, had the world’s largest economy in the 1700s and 1800s, but its relatively low level of technology and energy consumption left it at the mercy of much smaller Western countries that possessed more dynamic economies, fossil fuel-driven energy, and powerful militaries. The United States, by contrast, built its post–World War II global primacy on the foundation of an impressive technological-energy prowess. The accelerated rate of technology transfer and energy consumption in the 21st century, however, has considerably weakened this lead.44 Asia, in particular, has made rapid gains that pose a challenge to U.S. technological leadership.45 For now, despite impressive economic and technological gains, China continues to lag behind the United States. Per capita GDP is regarded as an indicator of the level of technological achievement (albeit an imperfect one), and as of 2014 the United States’ per capita GDP was more than eight times that of China.46 But Chinese officials have made technological leadership a key policy priority and are investing enormous sums of time and money accordingly. The result is that analysts now debate whether China could at some point surpass the United States to become the world leader in technological innovation.47 Competition in Other Domains Although competition for technological leadership may be decisive, the United States and China have also intensified competition across the economic and security domains. China poses a lesser challenge at the global level in these domains, but the situation could change if China wins the competition at the regional level and secures the lead position in technology. Economically, China is eager to upgrade its industrial base and has begun to pursue more technologically advanced manufacturing capabilities similar to those of the United States. The economic relationship is thus becoming less complementary and more competitive.48 Chinese leaders recognize that for the economy to grow at a sustainable rate, China must move beyond old industries and instead establish innovative industries in more technologically advanced sectors. Reflecting the increasing convergence between the U.S. and Chinese economies, recrimination over policies in both countries designed to block access to technologies and markets for security reasons has added another source of tension.49 The persistent Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property has further strained relations.50 Other ongoing disputes between the two countries concern China’s status as a market economy and technology standards for trade.51 These disputes fuel China’s efforts to challenge U.S. dominance of global trade rules. In December 2014, Xi directed officials to “have more Chinese voices in the formulation of international rules” and “inject more Chinese elements” in order to “maintain and expand our country’s developmental interests.”52 U.S. officials have responded by demanding that China “follow the rules of the road” concerning trade and other issues.53 Militarily, the United States retains superiority at the global level, but its advantage in a potential conventional conflict in the Indo-Pacific has eroded. Thanks in part to its network of alliances, the United States retains an unmatched ability to project combat power globally and has an extensive military presence abroad. By contrast, China’s ability to project power remains weak. It has no formal allies and only recently has begun to field small numbers of forces abroad. For example, China carried out its first noncombatant evacuation operation using military aircraft in 2011—one of the PLA Air Force’s few overseas missions.54 The U.S. military also retains a formidable advantage in overall capabilities across virtually every domain, although the PLA’s rapid modernization is narrowing the gap.55 In the IndoPacific, however, China has developed an impressive counter-intervention capability that has increased the cost and risk to forward-deployed U.S. forces that might engage in a conventional conflict in the region. Moreover, China’s expanding inventory of weapons across all domains increases the likelihood that any conventional conflict that begins in Asia might expand worldwide. Already, Chinese military writers have outlined a doctrine of “integrated deterrence” that recommends the use of space, cyber, and nuclear weapons to deter and manage conflict.56 In addition, China’s need for petroleum and other raw materials from the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa has led to increased PLA activity throughout the Indian Ocean and the establishment of the country’s first foreign base in Djibouti.57 Currently, many observers regard these developments as a lower threat to U.S. interests than the development of PLA counter-intervention capabilities in the Asia-Pacific.58 However, the proliferating points of potential interaction with the military forces of the United States and its allies should be evaluated against the background of an economic, political, and military competition that may intensify in coming years. As in the escalation of the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, China’s increasingly global interests and capabilities open possibilities for militarized disputes and crises around the world in coming decades. The U.S.-China strategic rivalry thus encompasses both the regional and global levels, has grown multilateral, and spans the economic, military, and political domains. Yet it still possesses considerable room for further expansion. China remains in the early years of major initiatives and reforms to increase its economic competitiveness, improve its military’s reach and lethality, and promote Chinese culture, political values, and ideals. As the gap in comprehensive national power narrows in coming decades, competition between the two countries will almost certainly intensify. no shortcut to ending the u.s.-china rivalry Is it possible to shift the fundamental drivers of the U.S.-China relationship from rivalry to cooperation and thereby remove the risk of conflict? Leaders in both Beijing and Washington affirm their determination to do so.59 During President Trump’s November 2017 visit to Beijing, President Xi vowed that China and the United States would “pursue friendship and win-win cooperation.” President Trump in turn remarked that the two countries faced an “incredible opportunity to advance peace and prosperity” and “achieve a more just, secure, and peaceful world.”60 More Cooperation Will Not End the Rivalry Western experts have offered detailed proposals to encourage cooperation and further reduce the risks of conflict. Many of these focus on the most highprofile flashpoints such as Taiwan and the South China Sea. But since the proposals do not address the multilevel competition for leadership at the heart of the current rivalry, they are unlikely to significantly reduce the risks of systemic warfare. Ironically, some of the proposals, if implemented, could incite a more dangerous rivalry by enabling China’s consolidation of regional and technological leadership and thereby facilitating its ability to contest U.S. leadership at the global level. The most commonly encountered proposals fall into two general types of arrangements: “grand bargains” and “shared leadership,” both of which seek to address the contest at the regional level. Below we discuss some examples of each type of proposal. Charles Glaser’s recommendation that the United States offer to end its support to Taiwan in exchange for China agreeing to end its efforts to undermine U.S. alliances and partnerships represents the classic grand bargain approach. This proposal fails principally because it underestimates the systemic and comprehensive nature of the competition at both the regional and global levels.61 Taiwan is just one symptom of the contest over the evolution of regional and global order that is already well underway. Facilitating China’s acquisition of Taiwan would thus not end the competition. To the contrary, consolidation of Chinese control over the island could free up resources for Beijing to press harder on other issues—including ending the U.S. alliances that Glaser’s proposal originally sought to preserve. Indeed, China’s security policy for Asia makes clear that Beijing regards these alliances as an obstacle and aims to weaken or end them.62 Michael Swaine expands the terms of a grand bargain but follows a similar logic. He proposes a “neutral zone” in which the United States weakens its commitments to South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan in exchange for a pledge by China to renounce military action as a means of resolving its differences with its neighbors. This proposal, like other variants of the grand bargain, rests on the faulty assumption that Chinese behavior in Asia is “motivated almost entirely by uncertainties, fears, insecurities, and a certain level of opportunism.”63 This view seriously misreads the structural incentives that inform Chinese strategic behavior. The competition for greater status and influence is driven by the desire to ensure sustained national development.64 Establishing a buffer zone evokes a soft sort of containment arrangement, in which China gains a sphere of influence in exchange for deference to U.S. leadership worldwide. But there is little reason to expect China to accept these constraints. As noted, the Sino-U.S. competition for leadership and status is already extending to the global level. Moreover, by misattributing the sources of tension to flashpoints such as Taiwan and maritime disputes, proposals like this one risk exacerbating the rivalry by severely eroding the credibility of U.S. alliances. A major diminishment of U.S. international authority could result in greater parity between the two countries, providing Beijing an even stronger incentive to step up the competition for leadership at the global level. Proposals that attempt a more systematic resolution through a shared leadership approach reflect a deeper appreciation of the problem but founder on the difficulties of practical implementation. Lyle Goldstein, for example, has advocated the idea of “cooperation spirals” premised on “mutual accommodation and concessions in equal measure” across a broad array of economic, political, and military issues.65 Hugh White’s recommendation for a “concert of Asia” similarly envisions cooperation for a stable political and economic order.66 In theory, it is possible to envision arrangements in which China and the United States consult one another and peacefully resolve differences on every conceivable issue. However, the practical problems of managing disagreements and disputes render such collaboration implausible. Indeed, efforts to share leadership of the global system, given the very different preference structures and the endless possibilities for breakdown or dissatisfaction with outcomes, would almost certainly generate frustration and resentment. Under such conditions, a return to the competition for supremacy would prove extremely difficult, if not impossible, to resist. Neither grand bargains nor cooperative, shared leadership arrangements are likely to end the strategic rivalry between Washington and Beijing. Nor do these proposals address the critical issue of competition for technological leadership at the global systemic level. But this does not mean that efforts to resolve disagreements over flashpoints or to share leadership on particular issues should be entirely dismissed. Progress on a dispute or cooperation on difficult issues can contribute meaningfully to a dampening of the rivalry dynamic. However, expectations should be set at a realistic level. Compromises on particular issues cannot end the rivalry—they can at best mitigate its worst effects and moderate the intensity of competition. Given the circumstances, this is a laudable goal and one worth pursuing so long as the systemic effects are carefully considered and thought through. If these types of proposals will not end rivalry, is there another means? Unfortunately, past precedents offer little hope for a simple way to quickly resolve a strategic rivalry. Research has generated inconclusive or inadequate support for the idea that restraining influences such as democratization, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), trade interdependence, and nuclear deterrence can terminate a strategic rivalry. While research has established that mature liberal democracies rarely fight one another, the exact reason why remains elusive. Moreover, these influences have historically proved to be less effective in restraining conflict between liberal democracies and authoritarian states. IGOs are unlikely to play a large role in mediating conflict between China and the United States because many of these organizations were created by the United States. As the United States’ relative strength diminishes, the IGOs that it leads will likely weaken as well.67 Mutual trade dependence has historically offered a more promising source of restraint, but the growing attractiveness of protectionist policies to Washington and increased tensions over a variety of trade issues have already spurred an escalating dispute between the two countries.68 In sum, the rivalry between China and the United States will likely continue until one country concludes that it cannot win the competition and accedes to the leadership of the other. Another possibility is that one side concludes that the other side has lost the ability to compete or no longer threatens the other. This has historically been the norm for rivalries that evade or survive decisive combat, and there is little reason to expect the current U.S.-China rivalry to end differently.69 Sino-U.S. strategic competition is here to stay, and it could last many years, potentially even decades. Aggressive Competitive Approaches Are Counterproductive If rivalry is unavoidable, should the United States adopt a posture of aggressive competition or even war? John Mearsheimer has argued that “war with China is inevitable” and recommended a strategy of containment accordingly. He has acknowledged that such a strategy would result in an aggravation of security competition dynamics but stated that this is an unavoidable “self-fulfilling prophecy.”70 Some political leaders and analysts have similarly argued that competition is unavoidable and advocated for punishing measures designed to humiliate or weaken China.71 As Mearsheimer’s invocation of terms that evoke the Cold War “containment” strategy suggests, the advocacy of aggressive competitive strategies mistakenly assumes that all rivalries share the same levels of hostility and threat. In reality, not all rivalries are alike. Those rivalries that carry high levels of hostility, threat, and competition tend to feature high risks of conflict. The last major strategic rivalry that the United States faced, with the Soviet Union, was an example of this hostile, dangerous variation. Although in the Cold War the U.S. and Soviet militaries did not clash in a large-scale war, they frequently fought proxy conflicts around the world. The two countries also developed massive nuclear arsenals as part of a larger competition for influence and status in Europe and elsewhere, greatly adding to a sense of mutual vulnerability, threat, and hostility. The U.S.-China rivalry lacks a great deal of the ideological dogma that helped make the Cold War a zero-sum contest. The rivalry retains the democratic-authoritarian cleavage of its predecessor but lacks the Manichean quality of a showdown between good and evil that suffused the U.S.-Soviet rivalry. While Washington and Beijing compete for international audiences, so far the competition is much more muted and is centered on various aspects of an international order to which both states remain largely committed. China’s economy is also far more integrated with the U.S. economy (and, again, vice versa) than was ever the case in the U.S.-Soviet relationship during the Cold War. Economic interdependence can be a powerful constraint and is an unusually distinctive characteristic of the current Sino-U.S. rivalry, even though the possibility of more acrimonious trade relations looms and there remains the risk that competition will trump interdependence or worsen the rivalry as both sides attempt to produce the same types of goods.72 Both countries have also seen large exchanges of people and culture, another important difference from the Cold War. And unlike the Soviet Union, China has shown a much greater willingness to cooperate with the United States on shared challenges, such as climate change, disaster relief, and maritime piracy. These differences suggest that the U.S. rivalry with China has the potential to remain at a less dangerous, violent level than was the case with the U.S.-Soviet rivalry. Policies that aim to replicate Cold War strategies thus are not appropriate because they assume a higher level of enmity, threat, and competition than what currently exists. Indeed, policies that focus on containing or subverting the adversary, or that aim to mobilize the public against China, risk driving the rivalry to resemble the more antagonistic, dangerous variety of the Cold War. Similarly, actions that unnecessarily antagonize China by suggesting it is a country that cannot be trusted or with which cooperation is pointless carry the same perils. The current rivalry, troublesome as it is, could be made much worse by aggravating perceptions of hostility and threat. Because the potential for crisis and conflict increase when bilateral relations become characterized by high degrees of enmity, threat, and competition, confrontational Cold War–style policies are likely to exacerbate the rivalry and elevate the risk of war. conclusion: managing the u.s.-china strategic rivalry The enormous complexity of the U.S.-China strategic rivalry carries several important implications. First, analysts should regard high-profile flashpoints such as Taiwan or disputed reefs in the East and South China Seas as merely the most visible manifestations of a systemic rivalry rather than the sole or even primary driver. These flashpoints represent the metaphorical tip of the iceberg, beneath which lies a large array of interrelated, complex disputes fueled at bottom by a competition for leadership and status at the regional and global levels. Resolving a single flashpoint thus offers little prospect of ending the competition, although it could in some cases help ease tensions. Second, the significance of disputes in any realm between the two countries should be regarded in cumulative terms. Each dispute has its own dangerous possibility of escalatory policy responses, but more damaging is the potential compounding effect that various disputes could play in reinforcing hostile sentiments and mobilizing the populations of the two countries against each other. A hardening of public opinion could dramatically change the climate in which flashpoints erupt. As in the early years of the Cold War, an environment of intense distrust and hostility would constrain options for leaders to deal with crisis situations, raising the risk of miscalculation and escalatory responses. The scene would be set for a spiraling of militarized crises, brinksmanship, and clashes—fulfilling a historical pattern that has typified the most destructive of strategic rivalries. The most effective response to the evolving situation is to acknowledge that the U.S.-China relationship will remain a strategic rivalry for years to come and to manage its unique dynamics accordingly. The focus should be on stabilizing the intensifying competition, not on attempting to either avoid or accelerate a strategic confrontation. The starting point for rivalry management is to discourage China from contesting U.S. global systemic leadership by strengthening the United States’ technological advantage. Second, the United States should frame its competition with China as both a regional and a global systemic challenge. Third, Washington should balance cooperative and competitive policies with the aim of managing the competition at a lower level of volatility. Fourth, management of the U.S.-China rivalry must also consider the effects of rivalries between China and U.S. allies, principally Japan. Fifth, both China and the United States should promote exchanges, cooperation, and other policies that discourage the mobilization of popular sentiment against one another. Finally, the planning for and management of any military clash or crisis should be carried out with the longer-term risks of rivalry in mind. Technological leadership has historically proved to be a critical driver of systemic competition. To discourage China from seeking leadership of the global system, the United States should enact policies that strengthen its technological advantages. This requires investments to bolster the country’s technological edge and economic prowess as the foundation for international leadership, as well as investments to build military strength and reinforce U.S. international political and moral authority. The United States’ economic lead over its competitors is still significant, but the gap was once much greater than it is today. The U.S. economic and technological edge is no longer so strong that Washington can expect automatic deference. The United States will have to work much harder at leadership than before with less conspicuous successes and fewer resources. Unless it stems further relative decline, the only thing that will discourage challenges to U.S. leadership in the future would be the failure of China to generate economic growth through technological innovation. The United States should frame its competition with China as both a regional and global systemic challenge. While considerable attention has focused on the U.S.-China competition for influence in the Indo-Pacific, the reality is that aspects of the rivalry have already migrated to the global level. The United States should consider the implications of its policies in Asia for the global competition, and vice versa. For example, U.S. authorities should consider rejoining the TPP in some form, as this agreement promised to strengthen both the United States’ influence in Asia and its ability to shape favorable global trade norms and standards. The principal aim of rivalry management in the Asia-Pacific should be to maintain the U.S.-China competition at a lower level of volatility. This will require a combination of cooperative and competitive policies. Although China’s economy is expected to slow in coming years, the country’s comprehensive national power will continue to grow. Moreover, the United States will continue to depend on Chinese and Asian markets to power its own growth. Thus, it is in the interest of the United States to promote stability in Asia through cooperative policies to build infrastructure, ease tensions, and address shared threats. At the same time, constraining the expansion of Chinese power is essential for managing the risks of systemic warfare. To balance the effects of China’s rise, the United States should strengthen military alliances and partnerships, step up diplomatic engagement, and increase economic initiatives to shape favorable terms of trade. Outlining a compelling vision for U.S. leadership in the region will be essential to maintaining an edge in the overall competition. Rivalry management will require considerable attention both to the bilateral U.S.-China relationship and to the rivalry between China and key U.S. allies, especially Japan. Given U.S. alliance commitments, the antagonistic rivalry between Tokyo and Beijing could exacerbate tensions between Beijing and Washington. The United States’ management of its rivalry with China will thus unavoidably encompass related rivalries involving U.S. allies. To ensure stability, the United States will need to continue promoting the peaceful resolution of disputes, even as it upholds its security commitments to Japan and other allies. The competition for regional leadership increasingly underpins the potential for military crisis in the Asia-Pacific, and planners and decision-makers should account for this dynamic accordingly. Any particular crisis or clash involving Chinese and U.S. military forces threatens to accelerate competition and interstate hostility, and thereby drive relations toward a dangerous systemic confrontation. U.S. involvement in any clash between China and U.S. allies also should consider these larger risks. To manage this danger, decision-makers in all capitals should pursue measures and mechanisms to limit the potential escalation of crises. Discouraging the formation of large constituencies in the public in favor of hostile policies is essential to maintaining the rivalry in a less volatile form. Research shows that once public opinion mobilizes in favor of antagonistic policies, leaders face a powerful incentive to escalate tensions in a crisis and initiate policies that aggravate the rivalry.73 Chinese authorities have regrettably encouraged nationalist resentment against the United States, even as officials call openly for stable, peaceful relations.74 While this may give rise to popular support for the Chinese Communist Party in the short term, outbursts of nationalist fervor threaten to damage China’s influence in other countries and exacerbate diplomatic tensions.75 It is in the interest of leaders in both countries to refrain as much as possible from using emotionally charged language that encourages the formation of an “enemy image” of the other country among the public. China and the United States should also continue to seek opportunities to increase their collaboration on shared concerns and encourage the exchange of people and cultures. For U.S. decision-makers, the ultimate strategic goal should be to ensure overall U.S. leadership of the global order, but not to such an extent as to elevate the risk of systemic war over the sustainment of that leadership. It is possible that China will never be in a position to seriously challenge U.S. leadership at the global level, but it is also possible that China will grow to become a more plausible global leader in the coming decades. Past efforts to resolve the question of systemic leadership through global warfare have proved to be both horrifically destructive and inefficient. Nor has the world yet seen global war settle the question of systemic leadership between nuclear-armed powers. The good news is that history does afford examples of rivalries ending peacefully, among which the Cold War is a recent example. Research has provided some insight into why and how some rivalries ended peacefully and others did not, although the findings remain preliminary.76 Interestingly, some Chinese thinkers have similarly argued for strategies to manage the rivalry in a peaceful manner. Yan Xuetong, director of the Institute for International Studies at Tsinghua University, recommended that China “create and build an international relations theory for peaceful rivalry” in order to “prevent the escalation of China-U.S. strategic rivalry.”77 Liu Jianhua, a professor at the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, similarly concluded that U.S.-China relations have entered a “quasi–Cold War” state featuring “more competition and less cooperation” and “more enmity than friendship.” He recommended measures to stabilize the competition and normalize crisis control and management mechanisms.78 Efforts to end the U.S.-China strategic rivalry through grand bargains, shared leadership, or Cold War–style competitive approaches all risk exacerbating the rivalry and elevating the likelihood of systemic warfare. With no easy way to resolve tensions in the near term, senior leaders will need greater understanding and focus to navigate what is certain to be an increasingly complicated relationship in coming years. Managing the U.S.-China rivalry not only will require more attention and resources devoted to bolstering the United States’ position in Asia; it also will require more attention to sustaining the U.S. edge in global technological leadership. Complementing the competitive policies, the United States should also seek to dampen the mobilization of hostile sentiment in the populations of the two countries. Thus, in many ways, successful management of the rivalry will require the United States to adopt seemingly contradictory policies that seek both to assure China and to deter it at the regional and global systemic levels. Navigating the path ahead is likely to be difficult and feature a higher level of instability and crisis than in the past. Yet through diligent focus and careful management of competing priorities, a stable relationship of critical importance to the health of the global economy and the security of the world can be fostered. Considering the disastrous possibilities if the rivalry is mishandled, the future of international security and prosperity may ride on it. ≥
During their joint news conference, Obama and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto touted their work on economic cooperation and commercial integration. Likewise, Obama's speech to the Mexican people and a joint statement from the two presidents stressed economic ties and shared opportunities while only briefly mentioning such difficult security issues as drugs, guns and crime. Headlines suggested that the economy will become the driving force behind future U.S.-Mexico relations.Let's not get carried away. While security isn't the only topic confronting Washington and Mexico City, it's still likely to consume the lion's share of attention in this crucial relationship. After all, between Peña Nieto's inauguration in December 2012 and the end of April 2013, 5,296 people were killed in Mexico in drug-related violence — about 35 every day. That level of violence alone would keep security issues as a high priority for the United States and Mexico.Moreover, drug trafficking in Mexico continues to affect the U.S. Mexico is the largest supplier of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamines to the U.S., and Mexico is the shipment point for 95 percent of the cocaine brought into the U.S.So over the past six years, the U.S. has embarked on a strategic partnership with Mexico that has focused on drug-related violence. This partnership has meant closer U.S.-Mexican cooperation on several fronts, including an unprecedented transfer of U.S. equipment, U.S. training of Mexican security forces and U.S. access to Mexican security agencies.
Cliff Sloan, a top Washington lawyer, has been chosen as the State Department’s special envoy to close Guantanamo Bay, marking a step forward in what has been an arduous effort to fulfill President Obama’s campaign promise to close the prison.¶ “This announcement reflects the administration’s commitment to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay,” said State Department spokesman Jen Psaki today.¶ “Special Envoy Sloan brings a wealth of experience as an accomplished litigator and pragmatic problem-solver, a skill set that will prove valuable as he serves as the lead negotiator for the transfer of Guantanamo detainees abroad and manages the multitude of diplomatic issues related to the president’s directives to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, implement transfer determination and conduct a periodic review of those detainees who are not approved for transfer.”¶ Sloan, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP & Affiliates, has served in both President George H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton’s administrations in the Justice Department and as associate White House counsel.¶ The news of Sloan’s appointment was first reported by The Associated Press on Sunday.¶ Secretary of State John Kerry praised Sloan in a statement Sunday as the type of “bridge-builder” needed for the role.¶ “It will not be easy, but if anyone can effectively navigate the space between agencies and branches of government, it’s Cliff,” Kerry said, according to the Associated Press. “I appreciate his willingness to take on this challenge. Cliff and I share the president’s conviction that Guantanamo’s continued operation isn’t in our security interests.”
During the debate over the tax cut, Democrats raised concerns that an estimated $1.5 trillion would be added to the national debt. If only they showed the same concern for the $82 trillion behemoth that is Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. That’s the combined deficit for those three programs over the next thirty years. Nudging taxes up and down will do little to stop what really ails the federal government. As Congressional Budget Office projections show, the government has a growing spending problem. Much of this new spending comes from the three entitlement programs. With baby boomers retiring in vast numbers, the number of beneficiaries for these programs rises sharply. The CBO calculated that the annual deficit will increase from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2017 to 9.8 percent in 2047, optimistically assuming a recession will never happen in this period — which usually leads to a collapse in tax revenue. In a July testimony before Congress, then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen warned of an “unsustainable debt situation, with rising interest rates and declining investment” in the country. Entitlement growth is a looming crisis that everyone knows about — yet everyone ignores. No one on the liberal side seems interested in making any radical fiscal reforms. Instead, they engage in demagoguery by attacking any conservatives who propose changes. When Paul Ryan offered reforms to entitlements in his Path to Prosperity budget plan back in 2011, a liberal group called Agenda Project Action Fund launched an infamous attack ad in which a man portraying Ryan dumps an elderly woman off a cliff. Republicans will fail in trying to fix broken American health care system After spending the past seven years pledging to repeal and replace “Obamacare,” Republican representatives gave their first go at it this Read… But with Republicans now in control of the White House and Congress, it’s conceivable that entitlement reforms might happen now, right? Apparently not. In a betrayal to fiscal conservatives, the GOP-led Congress has decided to go on a spending spree. The budget plan raised deficits to $2.816 billion over the next ten years and received bipartisan support. There are boosts in spending for the military, border security, infrastructure and combating opioids. It sounds nice to give everyone what they want, but while bipartisanship won — Americans lost. The U.S. will not remain financially solvent if it continues to borrow with no end in sight. When Ryan did bring up entitlement reform this year, he was immediately shut down by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Fiscal conservatism was not his concern, nor the president’s. Part of Trump’s populist message was to defend entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. There have been many conservatives who’ve advocated for entitlement reforms in the past. House Speaker Newt Gingrich proposed changes in the 1990s. Mitt Romney talked about entitlement reforms when he ran for president. With Trump giving the programs a shield, those necessary changes are unlikely to take place during his presidency. What one businessman has called “the most predictable economic crisis in history” continues on unabated. America’s largest entitlement overhaul occurred in 1935 with the Social Security Act. A product of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, Social Security consists of social welfare and social insurance programs funded by payroll taxes. To put it simply, it taxes and it redistributes. — you pay as you go.

The large Baby Boomer generation was followed by the much smaller Generation X, and while the fertility rate rebounded somewhat for us Millennials, it has never returned to the heights of the Baby Boom. Life expectancy is another factor in the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid dilemma. In 1935, life expectancy was 59.9 for males and 63.9 for females. The financial burden at the time did not seem so great. In 2015, life expectancy was 76.3 for males and 81.2 for females. The number of workers who funded the retirees decreased precipitously, from 41.9 workers supporting one retiree in 1945 to 2.9 supporting one in 2010. This sharp decline in workers risks an increase in taxes — unless something is done. This crisis cannot go on. Whether the politicians want it or not, they’re going to need to make changes. Swelling deficits are not sustainable. Federal health spending and Social Security made up 53 percent of the federal outlays in 2016. By 2027, it is estimated that they will be 59 percent. This places pressure on other programs that conservatives and liberals both care for, like the military and infrastructure. Political leaders on both sides need to get their act together and save the U.S. from fiscal collapse.
Illicit wildlife trafficking refers to “any environment-related crime that involves the illegal trade, smuggling, poaching, capture or collection of endangered species, protected wildlife (including animals and plants that are subject to harvest quotas and regulated by permits), derivatives or products thereof.”[1] Many species are targeted by specific international markets, while some are targeted by a multiplicity of markets. For example, tigers are sold live as exotic pets, yet skinned for rugs, while their bones are sold for “medicinal” uses in Asia.[2] Many reptiles and amphibians are commonly targeted for the exotic pet trade, as are primates and tropical birds.[3] Still others are being driven to extinction due to their perception as “fine cuisine” in certain markets.[4] Most notably, illicit animal-derived goods, such as ivory carvings, animal-skin rugs, and taxidermy mountings are seen as status symbols in many parts of the world, and the existence of a market for “canned hunting” of endangered animals on private game reserves makes it increasingly easy for illicit trafficking syndicates to launder illegally poached hides under the façade of legal hunts.[5]
In parallel with the focus on human security as a necessity in the face of both natural and artificial forms of vulnerability, recent literature has emphasised the opportunities that environmental management presents for political cooperation between states and other political actors, on both largescale infrastructure projects as well as more traditional matters of wildlife and new concerns with biodiversity preservation (Matthew/Halle/Switzer 2002). Simultaneously, the discussion on water wars, and in particular the key finding the shared resources frequently stimulate cooperation rather than conflict, shifted focus from conflict to the possibilities of environmental action as a mode of peacemaking. Both at the international level in terms of environmental diplomacy and institution building, there is considerable evidence of cooperative action on the part of many states (Conca/Dabelko 2002). Case studies from many parts of the world suggest that cooperation and diplomatic arrangements can facilitate peaceful responses to the environmental difficulties in contrast to the pessimism of the 1990’s where the focus was on the potential for conflicts. One recent example of the attempts to resolve difficulties in the case of Lake Victoria suggests a dramatic alternative to the resource war scenarios. The need to curtail over-fishing in the lake and the importance of remediation has encouraged cooperation; scarcities leading to conflict arguments have not been common in the region, and they have not influenced policy prescriptions (Canter/Ndegwa 2002). Many conflicts over the allocations of water use rights continue around the world but most of them are within states and international disputes simply do not have a history of leading to wars.
Nevertheless, retrenchment and 'Canada First' attitudes, which have intermittently existed in Canada (in Quebec nationalism and in western populism of bygone eras, for instance), have reappeared since the end of the cold war but especially in the last few years, born of economic and budgetary concerns and preoccupation with the constitutional issue. They have been bolstered by widespread disappointment over failed multilateral actions in which Canada participated, made worse by the scandalous behaviour of some members of the armed forces, most notably in Somalia. Such attitudes are not the exclusive preserve of the right in Canada, but tend to straddle the political divide. For instance, while Robert White, the president of the Canadi an Labour Congress, advocates spending on foreign aid, the United Nations, and peacekeeping, he also calls for withdrawal from NATO because 'Canada's foreign policy should be grounded in Canadian realities. Our priorities should start with our relations with the United States and Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region and our Arctic neighbours. This is not to exclude other parts of the world, but to simply acknowledge and reflect the priority of our self-interest in these regions.'9 CANADIAN FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY IN THE 1990S: THE EROSION OF INTERNATIONALISM Clearly the end of the cold war and of a forty-year nuclear standoff that for many observers posed an imminent threat to existence has had an impact on Canadian foreign policy. For policy-makers the most immediate effect of the end of the cold war was the removal - in theory, if not in practice - of the only serious military threat challenging Canadian security. This not only eased Canada's retreat - at least militarily - from NATO, which had served as a pillar of Canadian foreign policy since the Second World War, but it also heralded a turn from Europe and the rise of selective internationalism, made easier by the redefinition of security.
Still, all needn’t be lost, and recent politicking may present a unique opportunity. Over the past ten days, President Obama has met with leaders from America’s three biggest trade partners in the hemisphere—Canada, Mexico and Brazil—on two occasions. After cooling his heels in Washington this week, Obama should make a speech similar to the one he recently gave in Cushing, Oklahoma, and propose a new basis for hemispheric partnership—energy security. The geoeconomics are straightforward: Latin America is just beginning to tap into a fresh oil and natural-gas bonanza, fuel that can be in Texas within days, as opposed to the six weeks it can take to ship oil from Venezuela to Asia. The technology of U.S. energy companies is absolutely necessary if Brazil is to recover its vast offshore oil reserves; U.S. industry will also be needed if Argentina and Mexico are to tap their shale-gas reserves, estimated to be the third- and fourth-largest in the world, respectively. Thanks to the oil and gas windfall sweeping the Americas, over the next ten years the United States could possibly eliminate oil imports from the Middle East altogether. Already there are inklings in this direction. Last year, Obama nixed the ridiculous tariff on Brazilian ethanol, even as U.S. ethanol exports to Brazil surged. Recently, Secretary of State Clinton and Mexican foreign minister Patricia Espinosa signed an agreement to allow joint exploration over a Delaware-sized swath of the Gulf of Mexico previously under moratorium.
Sexual abuse is surreptitiously incorporated into one of the most habitual aspects of women's imprisonment, the strip search. As activists and prisoners themselves have pointed out, the state itself is directly implicated in this routinization of sexual abuse both in permitting such conditions that render women vulnerable to explicit sexual coercion carried out by guards and other prison staff and by incorporating into routine policy such practices as the strip search and body cavity search. Australian lawyer/activist Amanda George has pointed out that at a November 2001 conference on women in prison held by the Brisbane-based organization Sisters Inside, Amanda George described an action performed before a national gathering of correctional personnel working in women's prisons. Several women seized control of the stage and, some playing guards, others playing the roles of prisoners, dramatized a strip search. According to George, the gathering was so repulsed by this enactment of a practice that occurs routinely in women's prisons everywhere that many of the participants felt compelled to disassociate themselves from such practices, insisting that this was not what they did. Some of the guards, George said, simply cried upon watching representations of their own actions outside the prison context. What they must have realized is that "without the uniform, without the power of the state, (the strip search would be sexual assault."99 But why is an understanding of the pervasiveness of sexual abuse in women's prisons an important element of a radical analysis of the prison system, and especially of those forward-looking analyses that lead us in the direction of abolition? Because the call to abolish the prison as the dominant form of punishment cannot ignore the extent to which the institution of the prison has stockpiled ideas and practices that are hopefully approaching obsolescence in the larger society, but that retain all their ghastly vitality behind prison walls. The destructive combination of racism and misogyny, however much it has been challenged by social movements, scholarship, and art over the last three decades, retains all its awful consequences within women's prisons. The relatively uncontested presence of sexual abuse in women's prisons is one of many such examples. The increasing evidence of a U.S. prison industrial complex with global resonances leads us to think about the extent to which the many corporations that have acquired an investment in the expansion of the prison system are, like the state, directly implicated in an institution that perpetuates violence against women.
Of the many conceivable contingencies involving an armed clash in the South China Sea, three especially threaten U.S. interests and could potentially prompt the United States to use force. The most likely and dangerous contingency is a clash stemming from U.S. military operations within China's EEZ that  provokes an armed Chinese response. The United States holds that nothing in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) or state practice negates the right of military forces of all nations to conduct military activities in EEZs without coastal state notice or consent. China insists that reconnaissance activities undertaken without prior notification and without permission of the coastal state violate Chinese domestic law and international law. China routinely intercepts U.S. reconnaissance flights conducted in its EEZ and periodically does so in aggressive ways that increase the risk of an accident similar to the April 2001 collision of a U.S. EP-3 reconnaissance plane and a Chinese F-8 fighter jet near Hainan Island. A comparable maritime incident could be triggered by Chinese vessels harassing a U.S. Navy surveillance ship operating in its EEZ, such as occurred in the 2009 incidents involving the USNS Impeccable and the USNS Victorious. The large growth of Chinese submarines has also increased the danger of an incident, such as when a Chinese submarine collided with a U.S. destroyer's towed sonar array in June 2009. Since neither U.S. reconnaissance aircraft nor ocean surveillance vessels are armed, the United States might respond to dangerous behavior by Chinese planes or ships by dispatching armed escorts. A miscalculation or misunderstanding could then result in a deadly exchange of fire, leading to further military escalation and precipitating a major political crisis. Rising U.S.-China mistrust and intensifying bilateral strategic competition would likely make managing such a crisis more difficult.
3. Establish conflict tripwires. The Departments of State and Defense should establish a set of “tripwires” associated with the onset or escalation of political violence, conflict, and mass atrocity crimes, along with an associated set of risk-mitigation measures and policy reviews for major arms sales at each stage of the sales process, including past sales. The process should include thorough reviews of partner capabilities, behavior, risk and liability under new or evolving conflict dynamics. The Departments of State and Defense should ensure that as the risk of civilian harm increases, so too does the visibility and access into partner operations. At the same time, the Departments should proactively consult civil society to identify the countries that merit additional risk mitigation measures or customized approaches, based on risk. 4. Strengthen the standard terms and conditions and DCS licensing conditions for high-risk items. The Director of DSCA (DoD) and the Assistant Secretary for Political Military Affairs (State) should issue joint guidance mandating that the standard terms and conditions for all sales require the purchasing country to comply with IHL and international human rights law, while also strengthening consequences for violating end-use agreements. DSCA should also work with Congress to clarify the definition of legitimate use under the “internal security” and “self-defense” clauses of the Arms Export Control Act, and reiterate that appropriate use under these clauses requires adherence to international law. The Director of the DSCA should also revise the standard terms of sale of certain items to include appropriate conditions for use, mandated reporting on the circumstances and reasons for an item’s expenditure or use, and where appropriate, any necessary additional commitments (for example, the partner’s adherence to a no-strike list composed of entities that are not considered lawful targets).105 Companies exporting items through the DCS process should be required to include conditions on terms of use and compliance with human rights and IHL on all licenses. The terms of sale for all items should also require end-use monitoring of use and conduct, rather than diversion alone (see Recommendation 9). 5. Expand the unit designation requirement and Leahy vetting to FMS cases. At present, DSCA Policy 16-32 requires the unit designation for any unit that will receive equipment or services under the FMF program, enabling the application of Leahy vetting to those units. The Director of DSCA should issue similar guidance requiring the unit designation for all units that will use designated high-risk items purchased under the FMS program, which should be subject to appropriate vetting under the Leahy law. 6. Supplement Country Team Assessments (CTA) with annual interagency arms sales risk assessments for certain FMS recipient countries. Conducting objective risk assessments as a standard operating procedure would both mitigate the potential for biased analysis during individual sales and improve the efficiency of CTAs by providing an agreed-upon body of analysis for the country in question. The current “Framework for policy review and risk analysis of proposed SSA Activities” (Annex B) provides a strong foundation, but a more detailed and targeted assessment should be required for the sale of any major defense equipment in USML categories 3, 4, 5, and 8 (which together includes ordnance, missiles, bombs, and aircraft) and all “FMS-Only” items. While requiring an assessment of all countries for all items is likely to constitute too heavy a burden for State and Defense staff, thorough assessments should be required for those countries to whom the US government is likely to sell major weapons systems or munitions, and who are either involved in armed conflict or have 105 Finucane, Brian. “Partners and Legal Pitfalls.” International Law Studies 92 (2016): 407-431. http://stockton.usnwc.edu/cgi/ viewcontent.cgi?article=1694&context=ils. 106 Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Identifying Foreign Military Financing Recipient Units, DSCA Policy 16-32, September 12, 2016. http://www.samm.dsca.mil/policy-memoranda/dsca-16-32. 107 Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy. an abusive human rights record. Risk assessments should include systemic factors (e.g. indicators of political violence or conflict, past conflict and human rights records, and corruption levels) and factors related to the technical and governance capacities of the purchasing country, including those specifically related to the risk of violations of IHL (e.g., command and control, training, intelligence, and coordination among elements of the military).106 Assessments should include input from civil society in both the United States and the purchasing country. 7. Adopt a more robust assessment framework for FMS pre-case development. To improve the process of evaluating and shaping partner requirements, DSCA should adapt its evaluation of purchasing country needs to include doctrine, operations, training, and policy, similar to the US military’s aforementioned DOTMLPF-P107 framework. Evaluations could be conducted annually or even biannually. 8. Institute formal processes for approvals and dissent. Letters of Agreement and other formal records approving major sales (as a function of monetary or political value) should be formally approved and signed by the Director of DSCA or the Assistant Secretary for Political Military Affairs. US officials or offices that have well-grounded concerns about a sale or a denial should be empowered to document their positions, and differences of policy views should be adjudicated through a formal, documented escalation process. Dissenting views should be fairly represented in notifications to Congress. 9. Require end-use monitoring programs to assess use, especially in conflict, and explicitly link end-use monitoring results to future sales. The US government should ensure that it has the access it needs to maintain visibility into the ways in which the major weapons systems it sells are used, especially during conflict. End-use monitoring and evaluation of USML items such as bombs, missiles, and fighter aircraft should be required to include a review of use and expenditure. The criteria for evaluation should include the outcomes of use (for example, any reported cases civilian harm), rather than solely compliance with international law. Under the Blue Lantern program, the category for civiliansinconflict.org 31 32 civiliansinconflict.org “unfavorable review” should be further delineated to include a category for credibly reported human rights abuses, violations of IHL, and harm to civilians or civilian infrastructure as a result of deliberate or inappropriate use. The US government should more consistently enforce sanctions for non-compliance, and link the results of end-use monitoring to future or prospective sales in the terms and conditions of sale. 10. Bundle and sequence more technical assistance and training with sales. FMS items in USML categories 4, 5, and 8 should be subject to a set of technical prerequisites rather than conditions. Through a system of prerequisites, purchasing countries could become eligible for the highestrisk items by aligning operations and training with weapons capabilities. Under such a system, the appropriate technical training would occur before the delivery of an item. FMS sales should also be bundled with technical and operational training from the US military related to appropriate use of an item—to include human rights-related training— which should be stipulated as a requirement in Letters of Offer and Acceptance. 11. Provide training to security cooperation officers and the rest of the country team at the embassy. Particularly for more complex country relationships, provide training and education to security cooperation officers, country teams, and other relevant embassy staff on the relationship between weapons systems and country capacities, risks, and the importance of defense institutions, accountability, and oversight.108 12. Provide more insight and education to Congress and staff. DoD should work with relevant Congressional committees and staff earlier in the process to identify options for minimizing harm to civilians through training and other due diligence measures for the sale of FMS-only items. Likewise, for higher-risk items Congress should demand additional information and analysis regarding risks to civilians; dissenting opinions within the executive branch; accompanying technical training and planned sequencing; terms of sale; and end-use monitoring (see recommendations for Congress below). 13. Make the arms transfer process more transparent to non-governmental stakeholders and 108 Rose Jackson suggests in her blueprint for US security sector assistance reform, “To be eligible for deployments to these complex countries, DoD security cooperation officers should be required to have higher-level certification through DSCA’s Defense Institute of Security Cooperation Studies. All SSA-related personnel at embassies should be required to participate in Integrated Country Strategy development and should be required to support the security sector lead as needed.” the public. As previously noted, civil society and the interested public in both the US and the purchasing country -- key stakeholders who often have pertinent information about partners’ behavior and capacity and may be directly affected by a misguided sale -- are often unaware of potential sales until they are officially notified to Congress. The Departments of State and Defense should identify ways to make the process more transparent to the interested public, whether through regular civil society outreach and consultation or public releases earlier in the process. The Office of Defense Trade Controls should also periodically release digital registration and licensing records to the public. 14. Clarify tradeoffs in appropriately relative terms: When discussing the tradeoffs involved with risk mitigation and controls on arms sales, external groups, and the US government itself, should clarify the true value represented by any one transaction, or even buyer, as a proportion of total US arms exports. Russia and China may present a competitive challenge in the arms sales market, but strengthening the terms of any one sale will not compromise a distinct American advantage in the global market, and could strengthen it in the long term. 15. Engage industry and civil society in a dialogue focused on reducing risk in US arms sales: Arms manufacturers can benefit from sensible and uniform measures that reduce the risk that their products will result in unlawful acts or other unintended consequences. State and DOD should engage industry in a dialogue, involving civil society, to justify risk-mitigation controls and to find innovative ways that industry can be part of the solution to civilian harm.
Lauren Berlant is right to be skeptical that a reading of a single novel could be solely responsible for producing such radical changes in individuals. However, sympathetic reading experiences can play an important role in a larger chain of events, alongside other moments of critical thinking and encounters with alternative viewpoints that might shift an individual’s  perspective. As the white woman Audrey said in the program on Beloved, ‘I understand something now that I didn’t understand before, and [the film] has made me want to understand more’ (p. 13). Reading can clearly alter one’s sense of reality, as evidenced by a reader of Cane River who noted on the web-board: ‘I don’t know if it is heightened awareness due to my reading the novel . . . but it seems like there is so much more in the news about racism; just today I read two articles.’ Reading fiction can help a person to develop an understanding of the plight of others and a sense of moral outrage, often seen as important precursors for action. In her ethnographic study of white women’s reading groups, sociologist Elizabeth Long argues that ‘reading, especially when combined with communal reflection and discussion, provides . . . in some cases, motivation for taking individual or collective action beyond the world of books’ (Long, 2003: 24). Several whites in the on-line and televised discussions were putting their anti-racist feelings to work in the public sphere, in their jobs as teachers and social workers serving minority communities. Although it is unlikely that fictionreading was the sole catalyst for their occupational choices, their testimony suggests that experiences of empathy in cultural space help to sustain and fortify their ongoing political commitments. While Berlant doubts that emotional shifts in the private sphere ever get converted into a larger politics of change, Lawrence Grossberg argues persuasively that ‘affective relations are, at least potentially, the condition of possibility for the optimism, invigoration, and passion which are necessary for any struggle to change the world’ (Grossberg, 1992: 86). While the experience of sympathy may produce merely self-satisfied feelings of benevolence that substitute for committed action, I contend that the larger impediment to radical change is not sympathy itself, but conditions that weaken its effectivity – such as wide-spread public skepticism that protest can actually accomplish social change in a world controlled by postmodern global capitalism. Like Grossberg, I see affective culture as an underappreciated resource in combating the disenchantment that threatens to nullify political resistance in the United States. My work on the politics of empathetic reading contributes to a recent shift in American studies, calling for an end to the ‘separate spheres’ paradigm that divided public from private, masculine from feminine, the world of political action from the world of feeling. The essays in the recent collection No More Separate Spheres! suggest that the line between the public and the private is a blurry one, and that these two ‘spheres’ are in fact largely imbricated (Davidson and Hatcher, 2002). With a similar goal, I have highlighted the political importance of empathetic reading in fostering self-transformation and a radical interrogation of white privilege. In this particular deployment of empathy, such moments of radical understanding could be seen as an incipient form of political action, rather than its antithesis. This form of self-transformation operates on a continuum with largerscale political actions in both ‘private’ and ‘public’ settings. Instead of equating the political only with the arena of elections, protest movements, and collective organizing, scholars also need to consider the importance of local, interpersonal encounters in effecting social change. Experiencing empathy for African Americans in cultural space may move someone to object to a racist joke among colleagues or friends, or to persuade an older relative that mixed-race marriages can produce healthy and happy families. One of the white participants in the televised discussion of The Bluest Eye adopted three abused black girls and is passionately working to help them to develop self-esteem. Is her anti-racist action any less political because it takes place within the ‘private sphere’ of the family? I argue that such local and personal examples of taking a moral stand do work to undermine racism, and are probably necessary stepping stones for individuals to move towards more public-oriented anti-racist acts that require greater risk. The power of culture in fostering personal self-transformation should not be undervalued. Although many of Oprah’s Book Club choices have been disparaged for their rampant emotionalism, I have argued that their solicitation of sympathy is in fact central to their cultural power. As Larry Grossberg contends, emotive genres are politically powerful because they provoke identification, belonging and investment, providing audiences with ‘mattering maps’ which reveal ‘the places at which people can anchor themselves into the world, the locations of the things that matter’ (1992: 82). At the end of the Oprah discussion of her book Song of Solomon, Toni Morrison revealed her own dream to offer such mattering maps to readers: ‘It’s the dream of a writer . . . to have something important, truly meaningful, happen to a person who’s ready for the happening and the key to it is the experience of reading a book. . . . It’s not a lesson that said do this . . . and this is the solution, but to actually engage in the emotions, the actions, and the company . . . of the characters’ (‘How’d They’, 1996). Oprah’s Book Club selections do not provide solutions to social problems concerning race and gender, but they do offer intense emotional engagement that is an essential ingredient of political engagement. Although sympathy has often worked to legitimate the status quo, my analysis of Oprah’s Book Club demonstrates that affective reading experiences can also disrupt ideologies of racial hierarchy. Conspicuously absent from most analyses of cross-racial sympathy are reading experiences such as I have spotlighted here, in which white women’s empathetic encounters with African American fictional characters led to an increased politicization and desire to combat racism in public forums such as The Oprah Winfrey Show itself. For some white readers of African American fiction, these testimonies of suffering offer merely a vicarious sensory experience that does little to alter their own sense of privilege. These texts produce more radical reading effects when empathetic connections are accompanied by critical reflection, when thought and feeling combine to result in a critique of racism and a deeper respect for cultural difference. While Oprah’s utopian claims about the power of individual texts to change the world may seem naively optimistic, she is right about one thing – reading literature and watching films do shape the feelings and ideologies of individuals. This belief, after all, has been central to the academic study of literature, and the motivation behind the move towards multicultural literacy in education. In this academic climate of suspicion toward a politics rooted in affect, critics need to consider that such cross-racial empathetic identifications in the private sphere could play a crucial role in galvanizing support for anti-racist public policy in America.
Pauline Christianity extends the central demands of Judaism to all mankind. In the process, those demands are of course altered, but their essential character as a synthesis of slavish and priestly is in no way diminished. On the contrary, guilt is intensified, the call for inner examination and confession, as opposed to external action, is sharpened, and man is made to feel even more profoundly his radical inadequacy. In addition, the New Testament provokes more vivid and immediate hopes for "the next world," and thus incites a stronger denial of the world. What Christians are exhorted to is the imitation (within their powers) of the asceticism and private charity of Jesus: on the one hand, active compassion for the weak, the suffering, and the untalented; on the other hand, condemnation of the strong, the successful, and the gifted insofar as they do not exhibit humility and do not devote themselves to the service of their inferiors. The effect, for most men, is to reduce their sense of earthly social responsibility to "love of the neighbor," a rather tepid, indiscriminating, pitying, herd mentality. After a protracted struggle with the "Stoic enlightenment" (A, pp. 42, 47-49, 59), Christianity finally succeeded in bending the tradition of Platonic philosophy, including Aristotelianism and the Stoics, into its service. The common ground shared by Christianity and Platonism certainly helps explain the intellectual victory of Christianity, and frequently Nietzsche speaks as if this, together with Christian seizure of political and social power within the various "peoples," suffices as an explanation of how Christianity transformed the philosophic tradition into a theological tradition. But in his most probing explorations of the relation between the philosophers and Christianity Nietzsche confronts more squarely the question posed by the apparent gulf between reason and revelation, or faith in reason and faith in the "absurd": what can explain the respect or obedience Christianity has won from philosophers, down through the centuries? One begins to discern the answer when one takes note of the fact that the Christian religion is post-philosophic; it poses to the theoretical man a challenge different from that of any previous religion. Acknowledging the existence and attractiveness of philosophy, Christianity dares the skeptical rational is to attempt a kind of self-overcoming unknown previously: "The faith which original Christianity demanded, and not infrequently attained, . . . This faith is not that . . . with which, say, a Luther or a Cromwell, or some other northern barbarian of the spirit, clung to his god and to Christianity. It is much closer to the faith of a Pascal, which resembles in a gruesome way a continual suicide of reason . . ." (BGE, p. 46). In other words, Christianity appealed to the philosopher's will to dramatic self-transformation or self-cruelty: "There is a cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith that is expected from an over-ripe, manifold, and much-overspoiled conscience: its presupposition is, that the subjugation of the spirit hurts indescribably, that the whole past and habituation of such a spirit defends itself against the absurd is sim um which 'faith' represents to it" (ibid.). Nietzsche understands philosophy to be, not the quest for truth for its own sake, but an exquisitely refined expression of the urge to reshape the world and oneself, "the most spiritual will to power" (BGE, p. 9): hence "The seeker after knowledge . . . acts as an artist and transfigurer of cruelty; indeed, any insistence on profundity and thoroughness is a violation, a desire to hurt the basic will of the spirit" (BGE, pp. 229; cf. 230). This is what makes him certain that the ascetic Christian saint must have tempted and intrigued the philosopher from the beginning: "no other type seems to have interested men, even philosophers, more" (BGE, p. 47); "why did they bow? They divined in him - and as it were behind the question mark of his fragile and miserable appearance - the superior force which wanted to test itself in such a conquest; the strength of the will in which they recognized and wished to honor their own strength and joy in mastery: they honored something in themselves, when they honored the saint" (BGE, p. 51).10 The conversion of philosophers to Christianity, or the adoption of philosophic methods by Christians, produces more than enormously refined apologetic theology. In the hands of scientifically trained theologians (the greatest example being Pascal) the Judeo-Christian insistence on probity takes on a new dimension of penetrating cruelty, and begins to scale new heights of meticulous psychological dissection and self-awareness. By inducing philosophy to direct reason's critical gaze upon reason itself, and its possible roots in "sin," Christianity compels philosophy to begin to rediscover-with more self-consciousness than ever before - the dubiousness of reason's claim to be the voice of objectivity. Thus the advent of Christian theology signals from afar the beginning of the end of Western man's belief in Plato's illusion of the "pure mind." Granted, the Christian faith does not deny the existence of the "pure mind"; it rather removes that mind to another world and postpones our participation in it to a future life (TI, "How the 'True World' Finally Became a Fable"). But in doing so it begins to reveal the frailties and mutability of the human mind which Plato was probably too naive to recognize and Socrates too devious to acknowledge." Only very gradually, and with a bashful and frightened hesitancy, does mankind under the aegis of Christianity unravel the implications of the demand for total probity and confession. The culminating stages in this historical development are dominated by modern philosophy. In the context of responding to the question, "Why atheism today?" Nietzsche describes the whole of modern philosophy since Descartes as covertly or overtly in rebellion against its subordination to Christian "doctrine." He immediately adds, however, that while this struggle has been "antiChristian" it has been "by no means antireligious." "It seems to me that the religious instinct is indeed in the process of growing powerfully - but the theistic satisfaction it refuses with deep suspicion" (BGE, pp. 53-54). What Nietzsche means becomes somewhat plainer in the next aphorism. The atheism of modern philosophy has a spirit altogether different from, say, the cool skepticism of Epicureanism: not only is it animated by a faith in the value of unpleasant truth but, what is more, it has its source in an advanced version of the "religious cruelty" which in its postChristian manifestation finally demands the "sacrifice" of "whatever is comforting" in our illusions about ourselves. It is this originally Christian conscience, turning upon itself, that gradually forces modern man to eye with suspicion the objects as well as the motives behind every "faith" until he arrives at the point where the awareness dawns that all conceptions of good and evil, god, and order are the creations of his own changing human subjectivity: "it is in one particular interpretation, the Christian-moral one, that nihilism is rooted. The end of Christianity - at the hands of its own morality (which cannot be replaced) which turns against the Christian God (the sense of truthfulness, developed highly by Christianity, is nauseated by the falseness and mendaciousness of all Christian interpretations of the world and of history . . .)" (WP, p. 1); "even we knowers of today, we godless ones and antimetaphysicians, still take our fire from the flame that a centuries old faith has kindled: that Christian faith, that was also Plato's faith . ." (GS, p. 344; cf. GM, III: 23-27).
This week saw NGL prices trade down—a negative short-term indicator. Despite falling from the highs reached in February, NGL prices remained up significantly since late June 2013—a positive medium-term indicator. From a longer-term perspective, many producers still find current price levels economic enough to continue to target and drill for NGLs, but they’ve suffered from NGL prices coming off highs (~$50– $60 per barrel through much of 2011 versus ~$39 per barrel now). Major producers of NGLs include CHK, RRC, SM, and LINE—many of which are found in energy ETFs such as the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) and the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP).
Apart from territorial delimitations, UNCLOS also creates a framework for handling other issue areas. For example, environmental management was addressed in the convention, and all signatories to the convention have fundamental obligations to protect and preserve the marine environment: Coastal States are empowered to enforce their national standards and antipollution measures within their territorial sea. Every coastal State is granted jurisdiction for the protection and preservation of the marine environment of its EEZ.14 The port state may enforce any type of international environmental rule or national environmental regulation, which are in accordance with the convention, as a condition for the entry of foreign vessels into their ports, internal waters or offshore terminals. Thus, port states have tremendous regulatory power within their territorial seas, such that these seas are best viewed as extensions of sovereign territory.
Without ever-rising energy prices or domestic credit, the Russian economy appears to have hit the classic middle-income trap: protracted slow growth brought on by the government’s complete lack of interest over the past decade in the sort of supply-side reforms that would increase domestic investment and productivity. Despite its endowment of oil, gas, and mineral riches, Russia has suffered for years from a dearth of private investment that could diversify its economy and cushion it against commodity-price fluctuations. Russia’s international sales of goods and services last year only barely edged out Belgium’s—and were positively dwarfed by the Netherlands.[2]¶ And it is no wonder why Russia is not attracting foreign capital. In the most recent survey from the International Finance Corporation’s and World Bank’s Doing Business survey, Russia was ranked 115 out of 189 countries, putting it on par with an average sub-Saharan country.¶ And capital continues flowing out of Russia. The European Central Bank, with confidential data, recently estimated that capital flight since the Ukrainian crisis erupted may be as high as 160 billion euros ($222 billion), four times higher than admitted by the Kremlin. This would be the same scale of outflows witnessed in late 2008 during the Lehman crisis. (Capital flight was estimated at $63 billion for all of 2013.[3]) As legendary American banker Walter Wriston once said, “Capital will go where it is welcomed and stay where it is well treated.”¶ The state’s control of the “commanding heights” has given it enormous degrees of corporate control in recent years. The energy sector is once again largely in state hands. Privatization plans continue to be delayed or scaled down, meaning that Russia’s most lucrative state-owned assets, such as oil firm Rosneft, are not on the privatization schedule and are unavailable to foreign investors. All these factors have made the Russian stock market the cheapest (in terms of price-earnings ratios) of any of the world’s major exchanges.¶ Not surprisingly, all of these factors have made Russia more energy dependent. The fiscal break-even price of oil needed to balance the Russian budget was $34 in 2007. Today it is $117. Russia gets about 70 percent of its export revenue from oil and gas, so even a modest drop would be a significant blow for the authorities and would force it to tap into its reserve fund. After running a budget surplus of almost 0.8 percent of GDP in 2011, Russia ran a fiscal deficit of 0.5 percent in 2013.¶ While Russia has one of the largest stashes of foreign exchange and gold reserves in the world—valued at approximately $500 billion—because its budget is so dependent upon energy exports to the West, these formidable reserves could quickly dissipate if oil fell to $80 a barrel or Europe were to stop buying Russian gas.
Biologically diverse ecosystems are characterized by a large number of specialist species, filling narrow ecological niches. These ecosystems inherently are more stable than less diverse systems. "The more complex the ecosystem, the more successfully it can resist a stress. . . . [l]ike a net, in which each knot is connected to others by several strands, such a fabric can resist collapse better than a simple, unbranched circle of threads -- which if cut anywhere breaks down as a whole." 79 By causing widespread extinctions, humans have artificially simplified many ecosystems. As biologic simplicity increases, so does the risk of ecosystem failure. The spreading Sahara Desert in Africa, and the dustbowl conditions of the 1930s in the United States are relatively mild examples of what might be expected if this trend continues. Theoretically, each new animal or plant extinction, with all its dimly perceived and intertwined affects, could cause total ecosystem collapse and human extinction. Each new extinction increases the risk of disaster. Like a mechanic removing, one by one, the rivets from an aircraft's wings, 80 mankind may be edging closer to the abyss.
We’re sure many weren’t too pleased that the FBI Director had hinted that the agency could be thinking about taking action against the likes of Apple and Google, both of whom have recently introduced encryption features that would basically make it impossible for them to unlock a user’s smartphone from their end. This is great for users as it means that law enforcement agencies will not be able to spy on their phones, at least not as easily as before, and now what seems like even more great news is that Congress does not appear to have FBI Director James Comey’s back. While official action has yet to be filed, members of Congress have tweeted that they doubt they believe such a law would have a chance of being passed. According to republican Darrell Issa, “The FBI and Justice Department must be more accountable – tough sell for them to now ask the American people for more surveillance power.” Democrat Zoe Lofgren added that Comey’s proposal would have a “zero chance” of being passed, with Senator Ron Wyden stating that he did not believe more than a handful of lawmakers would actually get behind such a legislation. Now in the face of opposition from both members of the government and the public, will Comey be backing down from his quest? We guess we’ll have to wait and see, but in the meantime it looks like users can rest assured that their privacy is still protected.
Barack Obama and Rick Santorum probably couldn't agree that August falls in summer, but on one important issue they are closer than the Winklevoss twins. Both regard manufacturing as precious beyond words, and both think the federal government should be making special efforts to promote it. Obama favors an array of tax breaks to induce manufacturers to keep jobs in the United States, and Santorum wants to completely scrap the corporate income tax on companies in this particular sector. "Everybody benefits when manufacturing is going strong," said the president. Santorum recently lamented, "We have the manufacturing sector of the economy when I was growing up that was 21 percent of the workforce. It's now 9." These are not exactly new sentiments. Walter Mondale, the 1984 Democratic presidential nominee, demanded, "What do we want our kids to do? Sweep up around the Japanese computers?" In 1992, independent presidential candidate Ross Perot, railing against the North American Free Trade Agreement, forecast "a giant sucking sound" caused by jobs going to Mexico. Pundits galore have long warned that we are "losing our manufacturing base." But if nostalgia were a sound guide to economic policy, we should be building Studebakers and rotary telephones. Neither Santorum nor Obama seems to grasp the realities of manufacturing in 21st-century America. The first is that it's not declining in the ways that matter. Compared with 1990, the total value of U.S. manufacturing output, adjusted for inflation, was up by 75 percent in 2010 — despite a drop caused by the Great Recession. It has declined as a share of gross domestic product only because other industries have expanded even more rapidly. Economist Mark J. Perry of the University of Michigan at Flint points out that in 2009, the total value of America's manufacturing output was nearly 46 percent greater than China's. Over the past two decades, our share of the world's manufacturing has been pretty stable. The decline in the number of manufacturing jobs is taken as evidence that the sector is sick or uncompetitive or the victim of unfair trade practices. In reality, the change indicates sound health. Our manufacturing workers have become so much more productive that they can churn out more goods with a far smaller workforce. The same pattern, by the way, is evident in American agriculture. In 1900, 39 percent of all Americans lived on farms. Today it's 1 percent. It's a good thing, not a bad thing, that we need fewer people to produce our food. Likewise with manufactured products. Manufacturing accounts for a shrinking slice of the total economy mainly because as we grow wealthier, we spend a smaller portion of our income on physical products, like cars and appliances, and a bigger one on services, from health care to cellphone contracts to restaurant meals. That phenomenon holds across the developed world. It's the result of the free market at work, endlessly shifting resources to accommodate changes in consumer demand. Politicians don't think they should tell Americans to eat at Burger King instead of Chipotle, or buy baseball bats instead of soccer balls. They didn't insist we keep our typewriters when personal computers came along.
NAFTA grants multinational corporations new privileges and an extreme enforcement process. NAFTA included an array of new investment privileges and protections that were unprecedented in scope and power. NAFTA elevates foreign investors to the level of sovereign signatory governments, uniquely empowering corporations to skirt domestic laws and courts and privately enforce the terms of the public treaty by directly challenging governments’ public interest policies before World Bank and U.N. tribunals. The tribunals are comprised of three private sector attorneys, unaccountable to any electorate, who rotate between serving as “judges” and bringing cases for corporations against governments.62 This process is called “investor-state” enforcement. Only commercial interests have standing to challenge government policy, not unions or consumer groups. Despite being embedded in a “trade” agreement, NAFTA’s sweeping investor privileges have nothing to do with the flow of goods across borders. Ostensibly, this investor-state regime was intended to provide foreign investors a venue to obtain compensation when their factory or land was expropriated by a government that did not have a reliable domestic court system. However, the actual NAFTA provisions expand far beyond that reasonable safeguard, providing foreign investors extreme privileges not available to domestic firms, and creating incentives to offshore investments to gain the new privileges. For example, the new protections include a guaranteed “minimum standard of treatment” that host governments must provide, which investor-state tribunals have increasingly interpreted as a foreign investor’s “right” to a regulatory framework that conforms to their expectations.
The Myth of Institutionalized Values School initiates, too, the Myth of Unending Consumption. This modern myth is grounded in the belief that process inevitably produces something of value and, therefore, production necessarily produces demand. School teaches us that instruction produces learning. The existence of schools produces the demand for schooling. Once we have learned to need school, all our activities tend to take the shape of client relationships to other specialized institutions. Once the self-taught man or woman has been discredited, all nonprofessional activity is rendered suspect. In school we are taught that valuable learning is the result of attendance; that the value of learning increases with the amount of input; and, finally, that this value can be measured and documented by grades and certificates. In fact, learning is the human activity which least needs manipulation by others. Most learning is not the result of instruction. It is rather the result of unhampered participation in a meaningful setting. Most people learn best by being "with it," yet school makes them identify their personal, cognitive growth wit h elaborate planning and manipulation. Once a man or woman has accepted the need for school, he or she is easy prey for other institutions. Once young people have allowed their imaginations to be formed by curricular instruction, they are conditioned to institutional planning of every sort. "Instruction" smothers the horizon of their imaginations. They cannot be betrayed, but only short-changed, because they have been taught to substitute expectations for hope. They will no longer be surprised, for good or ill, by other people, because they have been taught what to expect from every other person who has been taught as they were. This is true in the case of another person or in the case of a machine. This transfer of responsibility from self to institution guarantees social regression, especially once it has been accepted as an obligation. So rebels against Alma Mater often "make it" into her faculty instead of growing into the courage to infect others with their personal teaching and to assume responsibility for the results. This suggests the possibility of a new Oedipus story-Oedipus the Teacher, who "makes" his mother in order to engender children with her. The man addicted to being taught seeks his security in compulsive teaching. The woman who experiences her knowledge as the result of a process wants to reproduce it in others.
