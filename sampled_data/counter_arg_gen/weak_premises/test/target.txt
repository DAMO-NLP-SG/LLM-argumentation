this is trivialy launderable. i don't give money to the politician who gave me the contract. i give it to the politician from the same party in the next town over or to the first politician family . there are already better anti corruption laws than this on the books.
article 1: a man was shot and killed by police and did nothing wrong. it's totally believable to suddenly see police pointing a gun at you and panic, especially when you know you've done nothing wrong. articles 2, 3, 4, and 5: police shooting at suspects and instead hitting, and killing, innocent bystanders. bottom line: it's very difficult to shoot and hit someone with a handgun. police fucking suck at it.
i don't have a problem with your thought process so much as the thesis that this is the kind of racism which matters. the view is that the onus of racism is on individuals, who must work to police their day to day interactions with people of other races, and by extension, that racism as a societal issue would be 'solved' if people just behaved properly. this is a misleading and ultimately distracting view of racism. nobody really cares if you're scared of them. they might get a kick out of the white guy clutching his bag a little closer as he walks past, but at the end of the day this is pretty much harmless.
gotta get out more. food is a great way to first experience another culture but if this is all that they base their opinion on that's really weak. not really wrong though as it does show how different cultures can mesh together.
yes. they totally would given the opportunity. this is a totalitarian nation that hasn't resolved a nearly 100 year civil war, props up even worse regimes, and is synonymous with censorship.
very debatable. it assumes they have the skill to be productive and the desire to raise their standard of living above the level provided by your suggested policy.
detaining people at the border for illegally entering a country has nothing to do with their race. i have no doubt people trying to illegally enter the usa from canada would be given the same treatment as those coming from mexico.
amp; x200b;since historically in the western world 'white' people have held the wealth and power that people over a great of time in the western world have associated white with that. it's wrong and unfair but it makes a lot of sense from a human psychology perspective. as a white person i certainly grew up with white privilege, despite growing up between upper poor and lower white class my family relied on food stamps multiple times, while other times did ok . the concept of minorities, people of non white skin in particular were associated with criminals, 'thugs', etc. it wasn't a strong idea, as in go down and lynch people, but i now am fully aware of how biased the views i was exposed were even in a big city with a relatively high amount of diversity .
that's already how it works. you can identify however you want on things like the census in the us, no one is stopping you, even if you have 0 european ancestry. it's completely self identification with no mechanisms to challenge it.
idk as a early teen i had a pretty big life changes that culminated in a new school, no friends, and little to no family support. for the next 10 years or so i was pretty isolated. i was so isolated in fact i forgot how old i was for a few years and i definitely didn't have any birthdays during that time. i remember the first few years being awful and desperately looking for acceptance. eventually i just accepted myself and found that anyone's expectations other then my own was worthless and i was happy.
how does your military remotely relate to healthcare such as the nhs?
has it become a trend, or are trans people feeling more empowered to come out as trans?
oh yay now we get to talk about anti intellectualism.
you mean treating them harshly. the minute you ask them to do something that would otherwise get them fair pay but doesn't, you've exploited them. that's an easy line to cross when you have live in help. also, the fact that you could get someone, for free, from the other side of the world to do something for you means you aren't supporting people's ability to provide that in the us for the same cost it takes to house and feed someone, and take care of all their needs. instead of paying room and board, pay someone to clean you house every two weeks.
amp; x200b;that's assuming each women only goes out with one person.
in your opinion, what exactly made him falcon? i can't tell if you're complaining about the source material or the movies. this is something that happened in the comics. the studio seems to be following it to a tee. i don't see what's wrong with this.
isn't mental health seen as a spectrum already, the way you don't want gender to be seen? some people are grumpy one day, some people are depressed for months at a time, others are incapable of acting selflessly, while others are merely often selfish, etc. for your sociopathy example, that's not a binary everyone isn't either 100 'normal' or 100 sociopath. there are a million shades of gray, and we all understand that each person's mental health is unique to some extent. for some harder evidence, the dsm would put sociopathy in the category of antisocial personality disorders, which are then in the cluster b personality disorders, which is a subset of personality disorders.
no it doesn't. there are so many possible explanations for this, and 'babies are racist' is a pretty silly one.
there are, in various states or federally:1. bans on coverage of abortion by private health insurance plans2. bans on coverage of abortion by aca exchanges3. bans on abortion coverage for public employees through their health plans4. bans on abortion coverage for women who live in dc or use federally funded insurance. this affects minorities more than whites and the poor more than the middle class to rich. 5. bans on abortion after certain arbitrary limits, usually 20 weeks. 6. bans on abortion for immigrant women in federal custody. 7. laws put specifically in place to force abortion providers to close, called trap laws.
the electoral college is working as intended. the states are being represented.
you literally just described what, to most people, makes a movie award worthy. and even best picture worthy. it might even be seen as a formula for an award worthy movie. the oscars are already insanely huge. and while a few marketing folks might, most academy members are not going to push for 'generic movies doing better' instead of movies they believe in.
no conservatives are more up for a discussion but don't generally agree with the political narrative, 'you either agree with me or your anti science'plenty of scientist dispute the effect we have on the earth, but universities these days have a more tyrannical political system.
do you want to take over the world? as far as i'm concerned if i supposed ally literally hates our country again, care to provide some evidence? the people of china are protesting waving american flags and the people of russia clearly love america then it seems pretty clear who the allies really are the people in china aren't, a few in hong kong might be. and russia does not love the us. especially when european politicians do nothing but try to undermine the american president care to give some examples?
the one they banned based on pressure from the new zealand government's censorship branch?
depends on where they are from. success of civilizations are heavily dependent on climate, resistance to foreign disease, and animals available for domestication.
did timothy mcveigh try non violent protest and have it not work out? or was he just a nut job that wanted to kill people. if your hypothetical is correct that you should only 'go rent a truck to bomb people' after non violence has proven to work, i would ask that you show how this cretin attempted to achieve his aim with non violent methods and failed, and that his cause was so noble that he had to resort to violence. instead he went straight for bombing for a nut job cause. if you're inspired by someone blowing children up, find a new hobby.
this is inaccurate. there were several attempts to regulate the violence in video games, until one of them finally made it to the supreme court where they gained first amendment protection. the esrb did not ward off anything, they still needed an extremely expensive legal fight to win. self regulation is unlikely to work here, since loot boxes reflect the business model of gaming, not the artistic content, so it is well within the government's power to regulate.
no. why would it?
this part perplexes me. what does 'you were reckless and it's your own fault' have to do with anything?
only if you misunderstand what equality actually is. it's absurd to think we could all be the same, or have all the same opportunities. what isn't absurd is that we should all be equally free to pursue the opportunities out there, regardless of broad characteristics.
that's true, sort of. you can combine different techniques into a single solution every time though. it will be slightly different depending on the original orientation, but it's not that much harder.
there's no conclusion that can be drawn from that. liberals control late night tv. of course nobody's getting laughs from defending trump on late night shows. the liberals wouldn't even let them try. i ve personally witnessed conservatives laughing at and enjoying parts of itthis cuts against your case.
this rarely happens. immigrants tend to bring over certain cultural habits like religion or cooking or lifestyles but rarely do they bring over political ideology. partly because most immigrants don't come from democracies so they've never had any political participation before, partly because they've left their country and come to a new one so they usually aren't totally devoted to the political system of their homelands, and also because there's rarely enough immigrants to make an impact. one chinese guy liking mao doesn't matter, you'd need millions of them to just impact local and state politics.
why is this different from the democrats courting the far left? when someone is looking up a political topic video and then are immediately shown a prager u or ben shapiro ad, they are predisposed to looking into that view. what? so you're saying the fact that conservative ads exist online somehow out ways the clear and ever present leftist bias across all sectors of media?
can you explain why you think that society is at fault? also, small correction: body dysmorphia is when a person believes that their body takes a form that it doesn't. like when a person with anorexia thinks that they are fat. gender dysphoria is what trans people experience when they are unhappy with their body. trans people don't have body dysmorphia because they are actually acutely aware of what genitals they have, they just don't like it.
okay, so they're not adolf incarnate, but it is literally mockery . you just got done saying that they didn't mock the man; but that is textbook mockery. i'm really not sure how it could be interpreted in any other way at all.
unless you re a victim, it s hard to understand that even if you know you re in a bad situation, you feel as if you can t leave. it s like alcoholics, they know booze is bad for them, but they still hit the bottle. the human mind has the potential to be logical, but for some reason we don t use it enough. a victim can feel too dependent on their abuser. they can genuinely fear for their life or the life of their loved ones if they leave.
so if i believe i should be allowed to own black people because they're lesser than me, that's totally cool and it would be unfair of you to force your progressive anti slavery beliefs on me, right? if that's not what you're saying, how is what i've said different?
it's a 'dirty job' that's not something a lot of individuals would consider no; just like many other such jobs which is why they command relatively high fees for what is unskilled labour; naturally being forced into any of those jobs is perceived as worse to the average indivudal.
this model of class coding in the lion king fails to explain why the villainous hyenas speak in aave.
i don't understand why the punch was necessary. the officer states it was a 'distractionary technique' to 'get the teen to release his right hand from under his head. ' however, in the video we don't see the officer try to release the teen's right hand in any other way before resorting to punching him. for example, given that there were two police officers vs. 1 teen, the officer most likely could have simply grabbed the teens arm to move it before resorting to physical violence.
these two statements are contradictory. if you can't tell whether someone is a trump supporter or not, how will you know whether or not to harass them? sure, there are some who advertise it with maga hats and stuff like that, but as you said, a lot of them aren't readily identifiable.
i have two problems with this. first is that people make mistakes, its very possible to pass racist legislation, and have it not have the desired effect. the dangerous part is that they are going to keep trying. the second reason is that its very possible to pass legislation with no racial bias, and have it disproportionately affect a certain race for the better. for example a minimum wage increase will generally help african americans and other minorities more than other demographics.
why do you think a system that forces people to toil for others is a moral one?
i didn't see anything in those verses that supports your interpretation.
the word was used in the area before islam to refer to a god. allah comes from contracting al ilah, meaning 'the god. ' it's related to the word elah, which is the hebrew word for the christian god. don't go on individual letters because what you're looking at is a transliteration into our alphabet, an approximation of the sounds.
as you say, this has nothing to do with social skills so i'm not sure why you include this requests for information tend to be shut down with 'you should read the rules'.
this is the difference. when somebody gets robbed, nobody blames the victims. with rape or sexual assault on the other hand, there is a subset of the population that tends to make statements as if justifying the crime and exonerating the criminal, due to some twisted belief that usually women owe usually men sexual favors if the men are 'triggered' in any way. so that later, when people talk about, for example, how women should police their own wardrobes in order to avoid getting raped, it sounds quite like it's the woman's responsibility to avoid being victimized rather than the criminal's responsibility not to commit the crime. i understand the power of comparisons between this and things like locking your doors when you're not home, but analogies are never equivalences, and that's very different from telling someone they're not allowed to dress a certain way, as if treating their bodies like an object a gold watch to entice thieves if flashed in public.
so you are under the impression that you should be able to just take anything that you want without paying if you consider the price to be 'unfair'? how can you say this and consider yourself a moral person is beyond me.
they don't. if a journalist or media organization knowingly or inadvertently prints a lie they will be sued into oblivion for defamation or libel.
are you arguing that capital punishment which was pretty much the norm throughout history until relatively recently hasn't been applied enough ? there's pretty extensive evidence, and the belief of actual expert criminologists that you are incorrect.
i don't buy that, at all. sure, men were the hunters of the hunter gatherers, but if fighting was the main attribute of our species, or at the very least, the male half of our species, wouldn't we have sharp teeth, or claws, or y'know something? we're kind of useless in comparison to other animals without tools, which it seems to me, we're designed to build, since you don't see crocodiles building skyscrapers or anything like that. i also don't see why a more powerful body would be less aesthetically pleasing. don't most people find people who are fit to be attractive than people who are overweight or obese?
cool, now you have the unintended effect of reducing the hiring rate of women in a field that already has that problem. if women are chronically earning less, then a regulation is passed to bring their average earnings up, why would a company opt to instantaneously give all the women raises instead of simply firing low earning women to 'erase' the earnings gap?
the jokes not maybe but i'm pretty sure it has already happened that the more qualified heterosexual person was passed up for the job for the sake of diversity; just as it happened plenty of times in the other direction.
everything after this point seems to just be speculation based on your opinion. can you explain why the us was able to maintain a marginal tax rate on the rich above 70 for a solid three decades wwii through to the early 80s without any of these issues you suggest are inevitable cropping up?
a few days ago in real life, and pretty much every day online on any posts related to eating a plant based diet. i eat a mostly plant based diet, and eat meat with 2 3 meals a week. no, eating meat isn't good for the planet, and most of the healthy diets aren't meat based. that said, nobody gets converted by people condescending to them. i think most meat eaters will readily admit to the cognitive dissonance of eating one animal while having another as a pet.
chromosomal sex determination was first observed in 1906, but we have categorized people as men and as women long before that. realistically, 'men' and 'women' two ill defined clusters of humans who are identified as such by a combination of their genitals at birth, by their chromosomes, by their hormonally influenced secondary sex characteristics, by their presentation of gendered social behavior, the latter of which is also largely informed by their identity. there is a temptation to act like concepts that were discovered and named by people wearing lab coats are inherently 'objective' and 'real', but that can come at the expense of accurately describing the way these concepts are really used i real life.
clearly not if they have low numbers. seems like a lot of adults understand all this, but it still takes a certain kind of person to coach competitive sports. but i'm not sure how to disprove all of this in general. coaches in my area are pretty chill. same as what i had when i was a kid.
even though in individual cases it could indeed be fine, i believe that it's the bad aspects still outweigh the good ones, and that incest should therefore be rejected on balance. if society were to broadly allow incest with only a few prohibited types this would likely boost the general acceptance of incest within society and thus also increase the prevalence of the kinds of incest cases that you list, and that are bad for the reasons you mentioned. so even if it's not inherently bad in all cases, it's still better to reject it altogether. separately, you'd also have to look into the long term effects of continuous inbreeding in certain populations if the legal prohibition were to be lifted. it would reduce the general variation in the gene pool, which makes those individuals less resilient against health issues, and it can even the lower iq levels over time.
most teachers update their lesson plans regularly, either because they get super bored doing the same thing over and over again, or because there's new information, or because the state changes course requirements.
this isn't an echo chamber this is the nature of substantive discussionthe point is that you need to have a baseline level of agreement at the beginning. the substantive part becomes the disagreement. if there is too much baseline disagreement, then you can't get anywhere. mr's idea is to have a discussion of the following kind 'you and i both want x, but we disagree about how to get there. ' where as what you are suggesting is having a discussion where 'i want x and you want y' which will not work, because then all the discussion is, is a debate where each side is trying to get the other to want what they want, which will not happen.
so, i follow someone because i want to follow them. and then, without my permission or consent, the platform removes me as a follower? shouldn't that be my decision as a user?
wealthy people are already doing all of this. in any event, wouldn't it be better to simply close some of these loopholes than to just concede that since rich people will try to cheat the system, we might as well not even bother trying to tax them?
people should start accepting the reality about the united states not descending into economic and social chaos. they need to understand that, just making noise on twitter about a socialist utopia will not change anything.
you work a job that requires you to spend all of your time preparing for class, training, and thinking about work, at a salary that's relatively low especially after the number of hours worked are factored in , and see how fulfilled you feel.
go to settings preferences languagesthere's an option to automatically turn all tabs into 4 spaces. you'll never run into indentation issues again. i also tutor python to students online who have frequent indentation issues in their code due to mixing tabs vs. spaces. np has a single button to replace all tabs with 4 spaces or vice versa, which makes it very quick and easy to fix. admittedly, np 's default settings are not ideal.
this is where you are wrong businesses have a duty to protect their public image, on several fronts; legally in the us at least if a company doesn't punish sexist behavior, when they are made aware of it, open themselves to large fines and lawsuits. institutions need to protect their public image. as an example, should a school be allowed to fire a high school teacher if it becomes public, that the teacher also works as a stripper? how about a police department, that knows an officer is making racist statements on facebook? this could jeopardize any and every case this officer worked on.
no, no, no, and no. this is a common tactic used by the establishment parties to demonize and discourage alternative candidates from running. it is a third party's fault or a secondary candidate running within one of the establishment parties, like bernie for 'spoiling' the election for a establishment party candidate inasmuch as it's the fault of the establishment candidate 'spoiling' the election for a third party candidate. in other words, it is not the third party candidate's fault for a voting scheme biased in favor of a two party system. that is a structural issue which has no place being the third party's burden.
america is fairly unique in this regard, because a large portion of it started as a slave plantation economy, and also most european nations ended slavery by paying slave owners exaggerated costs to liberate their 'property', britain didn't finshing paying off that debt until 2015. the historical reality of that is that we havw nearly halfthe country destroyed by civil war, and a huge population of absolutely destitute former slaves with no resources provided to them. that kind of inter generational poverty and oppression is some thing fairly unique to the us, and causes many of our persistent issues. crime is rampant depends on what type of crime you are talking about. we have a higher rate of fatalities in the us but a much lower rate of assaults, burglaries, and robberies. this is unsurprising given our higher rate of gun ownership.
no, it definitely applies to anyone and everyone working in the fashion industry.
amp; x200b;the political view you're expressing here is beyond apathy; it's completely opting out of critically thinking about politics. to name one example, that 'more of the same' included protections for trans people , and trump has almost completely stripped them away at this point. if you look at that and go, 'hm! interesting! ' then the ethical system you're using to vote either doesn't exist or is so alien that you need to explain it in depth.
easy answer; because humans are different and always will be different. you want a world where no one insults the other? you've either gotta outlaw insults fascist af or somehow make everyone think the same way and how do you enforce state sponsored thought? totalitarian af both of these existences seem far more immoral to me than a world where some random dude is allowed to call me a cunt because i don't care when some dude calls me a cunt, but i probably would care if i could get sent to jail for saying the wrong thing or thinking the wrong way.
you do understand that this is the real root of the view right? if you are unwilling to engage with this idea then your view is more or less boiled down to ' thing i don't like is bad therefore it should not be shown, because it is bad to show bad things. ' and this is literally a useless argument to go down because the statement is just tautological and doesn't actually mean anything. unless you want to engage with the real root of your view then there is no point in discussing the ones that come out of it.
do you believe that human beings have a right to personal autonomy and self determination over what happens to their bodies? does this not include a right to be a danger to themselves ? a homicide represents a violation of that right while a suicide does not. is it not up to the people themselves to decide if their own life is worth living? do they not have a say in determining if ending their life is needless ?
this is incorrect. comic books scale their enemies to their heroes, so yeah if superman fought batman's rogues there'd be no tension, but he has his own villains. general zod has the same powers as supes because he's a kryptonian as well. brainiac is more powerful than him. doomsday is more powerful than him.
what benefit would this give? what's to say that they're 'accurate and appropriate'?
if you can't say unequivocally that a nazi has an inalienable, absolute, undeniable right to demonstrate and speak his mind freely without fear for his personal safety or government persecution, you don't believe in free speech. there's no halfway you believe in it or you don't. . i'm curious why you think free speech means 'absolute free speech'? do you think people should be able to threaten other people with violence and not be prosecuted?
data are still data, whether it's a local case or not. pay should reflect the value that an employee brings to the company. if in the last few years the women's us team brought in more money than the men's us team, then pay in the last few years should reflect that.
this is only true because most mothers consent to their child using their bodies for 9 months. if the mother does not consent, then of course this is an act of aggression. you are essentially making the argument that because most mothers are okay with sharing their bodies with their offspring, that all mothers are okay with it even when those mothers are telling you that they are not okay with it.
this is your personal criteria. sometimes, all people want is honesty a movie that shows reality for what it is instead of trying to sugar coat it. sometimes, shock value provides catharsis to people, a let out for emotions they were trying to hold in. we live in a culture of hyper positivity, where negative expressions are penalized or forcibly twisted to make them moralistic or hopeful. for some people, watching something shocking and horrifying provides the right outlet for emotional de stressing.
to paraphrase rothbard, free speech is an extention of property rights. the reason free speech should apply on public property is because it's the property of the public. on private property it's up to the property owners to decide what others are allowed to do or say on their property. you don't have a right to be in my apartment, in my store or on my lawn. and if i allow you onto my property that does not give you the right to do or say whatever you want, i'm well within my rights to kick you out of my apartment if you take a shit on the floor or kick you out of my store if you say something i don't like.
it really annoys me that these people can have sex act on camera and get paid handsomely for it, whilst other people have to do actual jobs, usually for far less money.
odds. there's a 1 someone mocking zee germans wants to hit you; for some racial groups, it's more like 50 50. one doesn't mess around or wait for clarification with odds like that.
they do expose their bodies. they do not sacrifice them any more than do football players or construction workers or dancers or anyone else who uses their body to make their living.
oftentimes you'll find those creators selling 'online courses'so you prefer to be forced to pay? you don't believe that you can have a choice and still pay? what is wrong with having a choice?
why can't both of these examples simply be proof that moderators are overworked? i know moderators of popular subs have to deal with a lot of bullshit, especially subs involving politics tend to see a lot of heated debates and moderator intervention. as such, a lot of moderators on reddit have: a little time to go into extensive debates b seen a lot of the same arguments that generally get made when people are angry about their ban. for example, a moderator doesn't win anything by going into a long debate with a user that thinks his 1a rights are being violated because they got banned from a subreddit. the argument doesn't make sense, and the moderator would waste quite some time explaining why the user is wrong.
they keep your drink cold hot a lot better due to their thicknesswell, not exactly, this is true for something you're going to drink slowly, perhaps but not of anything you want to drink quickly. because a mug is thicker, it has a higher thermal mass. it will drain more heat from a liquid than a thinner container and release more heat into a cold liquid. bars that serve bears in larger mugs steins get around this problem by keeping those steins in the freezer. that way the effect is actually reversed but this is not practical for most of us.
can i think they are clearly written to disproportionately affect a certain race, making the policy racist. for example, the crack cocaine distinction is a super racist policy, and whoever made it is probably racist.
this is actually an important line here. don't you believe trump deserves the protection of the law, just like anyone else in the us? this entire issue has dissoved into huge partisan fights of semi informed people. the media has been distorting the truth to both sides. the 'left media' has been giving soundbite after soundbite to the dems and carefully sidestepping the legal issues barr has in releasing the report and the explicit changes after starr's report to congress.
thing is, not really. trumps supporters and a lot of people who voted for trump did so in full awareness of his promise to build a wall. have you been to a border state recently? you might be surprised to find border control including a wall has significant bipartisan support. it's only when you get all the way up to new england that democrats are comfortable condemning it out right.
neither of the men you listed moved somewhere else. they continued to enjoy the us without doing what was required to protect it. any country requires things that its citizens must do in order to survive and maintain their way of life. most of the time it's pay taxes and obey laws even that's a pretty soft requirement , however sometimes people need to fight for their country to protect it. if you become a us citizen you take an oath and here's an excerpt:i will support and defend the constitution and laws of the united states of america against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that i will bear arms on behalf of the united states when required by the lawunderstanding these men were natural born citizens, they don't have to take an oath, it can still be implied that these are the expectations of any citizen of the us.
it's not about accuracy, unless it's a documentary, in which case people are expecting it to be more real. the blurriness doesn't make it more or less believable, no viewer has this expectation. what high frame rate and or low quality video does do is take away from the immersion illusion. it's not if a little is good, then more must be better. it's a bell curve, and if you stray too far towards one end, it's going to break the illusion.
what does this mean? do you think abortion should be legal at all?
i don't have a problem with them.
because they can also have a wonderful time with sexual activity, and life is about making choices and dealing with the consequences of the choices. that said, we don't have to allow bad people to take advantage of children, just because we want children to have the opportunity to get messy and make a few mistakes.
sooo, the purpose of your daughter having friends is to make you happy, not her ? or do you seriously believe that childs play is harming her somehow?
think about it, if your entire body was comfortable except your left pinky toe, which hurts, you would focus on your left pinky toe, overall more of your body is comfortable, but you feel more pain because it is natural to focus on the pain. this is a good thing overall, it caused us to come up with the comfort increasing technology you mentioned, but it is a double edged sword, because as long as we haven t invented enough technology to remove all pain whatsoever, we can t enjoy it. and i wouldn t want to live in a world without pain, it would be meaningless, though that is very debatable.
because the majority of anti fascist action in the us is local, more or less by necessity in a lot of cases. the people you're talking about don't have the thousands of dollars it would take to get to a group to cuba so they could illegally march onto a us naval base, get arrested and spend months or years fighting a protracted legal battle. they don't have the money to just casually travel to palestine, and so forth. but what they do have is time, energy, and unfortunately local nazi fucks. you also have to keep in mind that antifa draws a lot of its methodology from early attempt to fight things like british fascism.
i want to unpack that as a for instance. i would argue that the left says populism is not on the rise. populism is the sense that ordinary people are the voice of their government, that their concerns are front and center. the left, i feel, would argue that it isn't on the rise its on the decline. it would argue that special interests serve far more of a role on politics and that drowns out the interest of the people.
are you seriously arguing that gerrymandering is unique to republicans? democrats in wisconsin won 53 of the vote, but 36 of seats.
