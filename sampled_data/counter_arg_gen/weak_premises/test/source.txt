 in order to participate in federal elections as a voter, you should have to be able to be drafted and pay a positive tax rate.	if you take payment from the government you should not be allowed to donate money to any politician which could in turn give you more contracts.
 People who are shot or killed when running from police should not be pitied	now, while i do agree that sometimes police tend to have a hair trigger, their job is to protect the public from dangerous people, both real and perceived.
 Caution and concern for one’s safety should outweigh concerns about being discriminatory	the question becomes, is it wrong to take precautions like securing belonging when walking through a low income neighborhood or passing groups of the homeless and primarily young men of color? i recognize that the idea that poor, homeless, and minority people are dangerous criminals is rooted in racism and other prejudices that i work to reject. but at the same time, i think not taking precautions out of a concern for being racist is dangerous: i don t think anyone wants me to become a victim of a crime because i was trying to be inclusive this is quite a foolish thing to do.
 : diversity is not our strength	it doesn t help that most the people i know who claim to love diversity only experience it in instances of food or fashion, not an actual exchange of ideas or friendship.
 The current protest in Hong Kong is a staggering over reaction fueled largely by irrational interpretation of the proposed extradition law	unless one believe china will overrun hk's judicial system there is no evidence to believe this is a threat to hk's freedom of speech and freedom in general.
 Every human being deserves food, water, and shelter even if that requires the government to pay for it.	if people do not have to to squabble, steal, cheat, and kill to maintain the necessities of life then they are more likely to devote that time to productive activities for themselves and society.
 Racism is a spectrum	just because you don t attend clan meetings doesn t mean the policy you support is inherently worse for minorities or people trying to cross borders into other countries.
 White privilege isn't a real thing.	you said it yourself: amp; x200b;i do not believe white privilege is a real thing, rather i believe it is purely derived from wealth and it just to happens that in the usa and other western countries, a larger percentage of white people are wealthy in comparison to a number of minorities.
 People with "one drop" of European ancestry should identify as "white" on all government documents and the census.	if 'white' is an ethnicity, then even '1 drop' of european ancestry should qualify anyone to mark that off on the census, on your dl, on job applications, etc.
 Being good enough for others is necessary to happiness	ps: if your answer is 'i don't care about expectations so it's false' that doesn't change my view. everyone wants to be accepted, that's not up for debate. you probably have a ton of support from others taken for granted either way so you don't know what it's like to be in the situation i describe.
 The United State is the Greatest Country in The World.	countries that outrank the u. s. a. in things like healthcare and education are only able to do so because america's military has secured the existence of a world in which such things are possible.
 Transpeople should not be treated primarily by physicians as having gender dismorphia and should be scrutinized heavily if they wish to have a sexchange.	i think it has become sort of like a trend to be trans.
 The Republicans are Philosophically Bankrupt, and are Causing the Collapse of American Democracy (Which was Flawed in the First Place)	this coincides a lot with the anti intellectualism part of republican doctrine.
 Indentured servitude should be legalized and de-stigmatized.	the fact that you haven't described indentured servitude aside:no, i'm not talking about exploiting or abusing them or being some kind of slave driving tyrant. they could help me out with things, and i, in turn, offer them a life in a stable, clean, beautiful part of the world with pay.
 Online Dating isn't worth it for the average straight man.	if we look at a popular app, tinder, we can see that 67 of tinder users are men meaning that only 33 are women. this alone indicates that its not possible for all the men on tinder to meet someone.
 As a black teenager, Marvel's way of bringing "diversity" is insulting and patronizing	falcon taking the captain america mantel takes away what made him falcon.
 We shouldn't abolish the binary gender system for a minority of people who don't fit into it.	in fact, i'll demonstrate around 10 of the world's population are sociopaths. does that mean we should change all of our systems related to empathy and on top of that, every time we see a person 'never assume his her emotional status! '? it seems absurd to change that, although 10 is a huge number.
 the only way to solve racism is organizing everyone on Earth into entirely different continents based on ethnicity	this means that all humans are inherently racist.
 The modern women's march is a directionless movement and to liken it to the suffragette movement is completely absurd	given my understanding that they are still legal and nothing is being circulated at this point to revoke that right.
 The Republicans are Philosophically Bankrupt, and are Causing the Collapse of American Democracy (Which was Flawed in the First Place)	the electoral college is broken and has ruined 50 of the last 4 elections.
 The Only Reason Black Panther Is Nominated as Best Picture Is to Get More Viewers	black panther is not award worthy. i mean it sure is, it was a great movie, with a great story, a great soundtrack, good acting and badass visuals. but it's not best picture worthy.
 As long as Conservatives maintain any significant level of federal power, meaningful action to curb climate change is impossible in the US	right now, american conservatives are firmly in the camp of inaction when it comes to climate change.
 America should not be allied with Europe. European citizens HATE America. And European politicians do nothing but try to undermine the American president.	it'll be the three countries that took over the world.
 /r/conspiracy should be banned for harassing survivors of mass shootings	they then banned gore sites while leaving literal hate speech site alone.
 *Women* are subhuman compared to men! Despite being incompetent or weak they often have better lives than their male counterparts!	would you expect them to be in better affairs than the other races.
 Timothy McVeigh, while technically a domestic terrorist, should be an inspiration to the working class, the underpowered, and the unheard.	i completely understand the idea behind nonviolent, peaceful protest, but when it doesn't work, sometimes you might need to grab a book and some friends, and rent a truck.
 Loot Boxes in video games should not be regulated by the government any differently than other in-game microtransactions.	in addition, the notion that regulation is the only way to deal with this issue seems a bit ham fisted. to compare the loot box issue to the video game violence issue, the threat of legislation and regulation was enough to get a gaming industry that was getting unethical content in front of children to create the esrb and essentially regulate themselves. to the political, legal world, loot boxes are still a relatively new problem, so it would be remiss of us to start regulating before governments are able to have a discord with the publishers involved and give them an opportunity to rectify their actions.
 *Women* are subhuman compared to men! Despite being incompetent or weak they often have better lives than their male counterparts!	assuming this was true, would it matter to you?
 Blackmail shouldn’t be illegal as long as the blackmailed follows through on their end of the deal AND no illegal threats are involved	if something that can harm you falls in the wrong hands, then you were reckless and it s your own goddamn fault, so you pay up if you don t want it to be known by anybody else.
 Equality is absurd	the narrative that we are all equal is therefore absurd.
 Solving a Rubik's cube in the fewest moves is far a more impressive intellectual feat than solving it quickly	since there are no fixed 'solving methods' for any given arrangement of the cube.
 Conservatives aren’t funny	i guess the most obvious angle here is that there s no politically conservative equivalent of jon stewart. no one on late night tv is getting laughs with witty defenses of trump or mitch mcconnell.
 I’m a nativist	i think if a chinese immigrant comes to england or america and hangs a portrait of mao tse tung on their wall, that s a bad thing.
 The Republicans are Philosophically Bankrupt, and are Causing the Collapse of American Democracy (Which was Flawed in the First Place)	the far right on their own weren t large enough to make a large coalition in congress, and the republicans couldn t win, at least initially without racists either outright or closeted , and so their alliance was built out of necessity, along with christian conservatives, neo mccarthyists, neocons, libertarians, and corporate interests.
 Trans people aren't the gender they identify with	i also see body dysmorphia as an acquired mental illness and not as something trans people deal with because of some kind of inherent dissonance between their mind and body. in my opinion, they develop this issue as a result of the experiences they make in life. they weren't born to have these problems, society is at fault.
 The Reaction to the "Native Leader" vs. MAGA Catholic Kids Event Is Wrong, Bolsters "Fake News" Claim	when phillips showed up some of the students chanted with them. some made 'tomahawk' gestures. that's probably insensitive. but it does not make them racist, or the face of the patriarchy.
 Victims of repeated domestic (emotional and physical) abuse shouldn't be blamed for the actions of their abusers, but should be held accountable for putting themselves in positions where it can happen. Particularly when they’ve been educated about what’s happening.	most victims aren't aware of what's going on i am very specifically talking about victims who have been educated about the dynamics of their situation and go back anyway .
 PC culture is ruining society.	i think it s perfectly acceptable for others to be as socially progressive as they want but i think it s unfair for those people to force their beliefs on others or censor those or shame those that they don t agree with.
 Prostitution is not just like 'any other job.'	to see why this is the case, consider that clearly someone being forced to sell sex is far worse than someone being forced to work in any other job like construction or accounting.
 Accusations that Disney movie villains used to be "queer-coded" are bullshit. Queer people are being over-eager to claim that every portrayal of a non-traditionally masculine/feminine person is a portrayal of them. If anything, Disney movies are class-coded against the privileged.	really, the 'coding' in lion king is class coding: upper class people are the target.
 the recent incident where a 15 year old was pepper sprayed and arrested was justified.	the actions by the arresting officer that gave a single punch showed just enough restraint that he didnt go overboard but it was definitely very aggressive to the untrained eye.
 Trump supporters should not enjoy the privilege that they deny others. We should be harassing them for their beliefs, based on how they harass others for the color of their skin, their identity, their orientation, or their genitals.	a trump supporter walks down the street. no one can tell what's in their mind. trump supporters should be harassed in the streets, should be harassed on reddit they do not deserve a safe place since they destroy safe places for others.
 The heavy focus on the idea of a "covert racist" is a waste of time at best, a malicious distraction at worst.	if a 'covert racist' is so good at hiding his racism that his policies are good for minorities, then i really don't care about his personal beliefs.
 Capitalism is the best economic system and is responsible for most of our modern prosperity	even if this produces inequality the capitalist system forces people if they want to get paid to produce goods and services that consumers want.
 in modern day, Christianity is the most washed-up, baseless religion, with perhaps no true followers but the Orthodox and Catholics.	it is written in scripture that if the entire world is converted to christianity, jesus will reign down for 1,000 years in the millennium isaiah 11:6 9, revelation 20:4 .
 Muslims do not worship the same God as Christians and Jews	contrary to what many people think, allah is not the word for 'god' rather it is his name. this can be seen in the shahada, the first pillar of islam: there is no god but god l il ha ill ll h as you can see, there is a difference the word for god as in 'deity' is ilah and the 'name' given to god is allah. because saying there is no god but god doesn't really make sense does it?
 Many mods are socially inept.	it tends to target individuals with very partisan opinions otherwise, why mod for that specific sub , those with too much time and too little to do. now, this doesn't make one socially inept per se, of course.
 Most advice given to women about staying safe isn't 'victim blaming', it's crime prevention	it's so obvious that a burglar is criminally and morally responsible for a burglary, that it doesn't even need to be said.
 Software piracy is okay.	if you pirate it, you say 'yeah you ain't getting money out of me. i'm taking your program because your price is unfair. '
 Journalists should be held penally responsible for what they publish, and so should the journal they write for.	amp; x200b;no journalist should be able to sleep well, knowing nothing will happen, if they publish a bullshit article. write bullshit, get legal bullshit.
 Capital Punishment Should be Made Legal in All States	first of all, it has not been applied enough to determine whether this is the case or not.
 Transgenderism isn't a "delusion" but it is a form of mental weakness, similar to homosexuality	our purpose was to hunt and fight.
 A simple mandate for business to spend an equal amount of money on salaries to men and women will end gender pay gap.	the regulation does not say the sum of all salaries paid to men and women at a business must be the same, but only that on average, they should be. so google can have 1000 male and 200 female software engineers, as long as those are paid, on average, the same rate, they are good.
 "Heterophobia" isn't real.	untill straight people can be fired, kicked out of their home, beaten, or killed for their heterosexuality, then those jokes will mean nothing.
Warren's 70% tax on 50 million is actually a backdoor to raise taxes on the poor and middle class.	what happens to governments that get money?
 the anti-vegan circlejerk is mainly fueled by cognitive dissonance	but when's the last time you've actually encountered one of those stereotypical assholes?
 Transexuals suffer from psychological/mental disorder/illness	men are humans with xy chromosomal dna; women are humans with xx chromosomal dna.
 highschool and lower sports coaches are way too intense when coaching anymore	it's crazy how parents think that yelling and telling the kids to do better will make them a better person.
 Incest is morally neutral.	i don't think you can come up with a moral argument that covers the entirety of incest, therefore incest is a morally neutral action.
 Most (non stem field) teachers actually have it pretty good	you can use the same lesson plan every year so you can fuck around in 'planning periods' when you finish grading. if state regulations change you can use new public lesson plans.
 Megan Rapinoe's message isn't resonating with me, and I don't like her as a spokesperson	she openly wishes to only have conversations with people that agree with her. ie she wants an echo chamber. during an interview with anderson cooper, she stated she'd have a 'substantive conversation' with 'anyone' 'believes the same things we believe in. '
 Social Media followers accrued while in office are a significant conflict of interest and should be forfeit once a person leaves office.	i'm not saying that legislators shouldn't accrue followers while in office, merely that they should forfeit those followers they gain in office when they leave office.
Warren's 70% tax on 50 million is actually a backdoor to raise taxes on the poor and middle class.	what happens when you tax wealthy people? they restructure there tax liabilities, they keep money off shore, they hire expensive accountants to find every loophole possible, they reduce there own income tax from their business and purchase assets in their businesses name.
 Trump should be president till 2020	and not because of russia's digital campaign.
 Most (non stem field) teachers actually have it pretty good	likely more fulfilling than most private sector jobs.
 Notepad++ is a terrible text editor to code in Python	i tried to interpret the code with the python interpreter it gave indentation error issues.
 We should not support businesses/universities punishing their staff/students over private communications	i understand and agree that businesses operate to a lower standard of proof than govt agencies and have a right to associate or not associate with who they want to.
 Bernie Sanders isn't a good candidate for president.	finally, he served as the principal reason trump won because he fundamentally acts only as a spoiler for better candidates. he is the ralph nader of the current day and split the vote for democrats between progressives and moderates, sowing discord in a party that should have been united all along. democrats in office are far more important than radicalizing the party platform, and by spending time arguing over ideologies we essentially handed the republicans control of the government.
 The United States is not a great country, and has a significantly lower standard of living than other developed nations	we also outlawed slavery long before america did.
 The stereotype that male fashion designers must be gay makes no sense	but, as far i can tell, the stereotype about gay men and fashion design seems to apply only to those working with female models.
 For the Democrats to win the 2020 Election, they are going to need to put forth a MORE liberal candidate	the way i saw it, clinton was just going to be 4 years of the same old same old and nothing will get done and that donald trump would be at least interesting.
 Freedom of speech means the right to have and express an opinion, not to insult random people	i have a strong contention with one line you put in 'why not a world of respecting people but just insulting people? '
 Wearing a Blue Lives Matter shirt should not be allowed in the workplace	the blue lives matter movement is a false equivalency that bigoted people use to silence the very real issues of black lives matter. i am not going to change my view on that part.
 American society focuses on homicide too much, and not enough attention is given to suicide.	people are more of a danger to themselves and yet for some strange reason homicide gets more attention.
 Superman is a completely uninteresting character.	so there's essentially no tension when he's fighting his enemies because you know he's gonna win, and never have to fear for his life or safety.
 All drugs ESPECIALLY opioids and amphetamines should be available for recreational use through legal channels.	my ideal system would be something that included a meeting with a qualified expert in the field providing the user with accurate and appropriate information regarding the substance they are interested in using much like the medical marijuana system before recreational was approved except recreational .
 The overton window has shifted dangerously far to the left, severely jeopardizing America's future.	it's become commonplace on reddit and elsewhere for people to not even believe in free speech anymore free speech with exceptions is not free speech.
 The pay-gap in Women's National Football is fair	claims that the women's team in the us brings in more money than the men's team is cherry picked data. this is true for the past few years, but over the long term, the more established men s game brings in consistently higher game revenue year over year.
 The Non Aggression Principle applies to unborn children	the actions of the child are not a form of aggression and therefore can not be used as a reason to commit an act of aggression toward the child.
 Gritty and "realistic" movies that are dark and depressing but have no real message past "Everything is shitty and you should feel shitty" are actively harmful and shouldn't be praised.	provided that they give me something positive and impactful by the end.
 You don't really value free speech unless you extend it to large privately owned platforms and corporations	i am sick of that perfectly true, but ideologically pointless argument that while you have free speech, privately owned platforms like reddit, youtube, fb etc don't have any obligation to allow you to express yourself on their platforms. this is very insincere way to 'support free speech' and is actually just the opposite, supporting censorship.
 Porn performers don’t deserve respect.	let s face it, what they do can t really be called work.
 Mocking or imitating an accent or a name shouldn't be considered racist by default just because it originates from a population that is primarily of a different race.	? is simply being of a different race all it takes to automatically assume by default that there's a racial motivation behind the mocking imitating?
 Pornographic performers are more likely to be manipulative and unscrupulous.	pp sacrifice and expose their body to earn money or gain fame fortune.
 A content creator should not ask for donations	my point is that i'll be happy to pay if you decide to make that youtube video or blog post paid. it bothers me because everyone is doing it, and it become really hard to do some research on the internet. too many affiliate links, sponsored content, ads.
 Many mods are socially inept.	. nevertheless the trend i experienced is that mods tend to take very little time and consideration on their replies and tend to assume the worst in their conversation partners. a reply with 'have a good day' or ' i don't understand' tends to be brushed off with the threat of a ban. these are signs of an individual abusing their power, and signs of individuals not having learned that the carrot is better than the stick.
 Mugs are better than glasses in every way	more insulated.
 The heavy focus on the idea of a "covert racist" is a waste of time at best, a malicious distraction at worst.	rather than arguing all day about whether or not a politician is secretly racist, start having a conversation about his policies and what you think of them.
 whoever leaks the Mueller report or Trump's IRS filings would be committing career suicide and going to prison, but would become national hero(es) by letting the American people know what they deserve to know.	love trump or hate him he should not be above the law. if you are willing to rationalize why or how trump does not deserve the same scrutiny as anyone else in his position, then you are part of the problem because he obviously owes us that. anyone in power does.
 Democrats Trading DACA for Building the Wall Would Be Another Awful Mistake By the Democrats	democrats currently hold all of the political leverage in this fight.
 Dodging the Draft was not Cowardly or a Reason to Look Down on Someone	man, i love the usa as much as the next guy but i'm not willing to murder people to stay in it or to help it. i'll move somewhere else.
 The "Soap Opera Effect" is not undesirable. Movies and TV should be shot at higher framerates.	recording at a higher framerate simply gives a more accurate representation of what is being filmed. some seem to argue that this blurriness makes for a more believable viewing experience. by that argument, shouldn't you also prefer watching at a lower, blurrier resolution?
 Saying an abortion is a choice to be made only by a woman "and her doctor" is just a way to legitimize a choice that is actually only the woman's.	i'm not pro choice. i'm not sure i would call myself pro life, either, since i think both sides take extreme positions that make it hard to identify as either one without adhering to some pretty radical ideology.
 *Women* are subhuman compared to men! Despite being incompetent or weak they often have better lives than their male counterparts!	let's say there was a random race of people who had green skin. all the men in this race had less grey matter than average and were physically weaker than every other race. how would people react to these individuals?
 States and countries with Romeo and Juliet laws are condoning child rape.	if you know that at 13 a child can be harmed by sexual activity, then why would anyone ever make it legal?
 No, children do not need to be "socialized" with other children.	the point is that we have not noticed any benefit that children can offer other than their sustained energy and ability to entertain each other in ways that most adults find repulsively bland.
 The comforts of modern life should make us euphoric, and the fact that they don't is troubling because it suggests the human perspective is critically flawed.	so why hasn't the modern american had an increase in happiness that correlates with the increase in improved quality of life over the last 300 years? because it s human nature to focus on the bad.
 If Antifa was truly anti-fascist, they’d be organizing protests against wars and the worst abuses of the government. Since they’re not really doing this, I conclude that they’re primarily interested in seeking out street fights.	why aren t they rioting outside guantanamo bay? why aren t they throwing milkshakes at james clapper or any of the countless other neocons who perpetrate the worst abuses of the us government?
 The current rise of populism and regressivism are not the result of an insurgence of racism or "postmodern marxism", but by postindustrial capitalism.	when you say: on the left we see the narrative that populism is rising because of institutional racism and patriarchy, and they blame everything on the right.
 The Republicans are Philosophically Bankrupt, and are Causing the Collapse of American Democracy (Which was Flawed in the First Place)	and even when they lose, they gerrymandered the country so hard back in 2010 that they still win substantially with less than half the vote.
