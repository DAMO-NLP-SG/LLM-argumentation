 in order to participate in federal elections as a voter, you should have to be able to be drafted and pay a positive tax rate.	as a single man of draft age who pays a ton in taxes, not really sure why my vote counts the same as a single mother with a low income job who pays no taxes and receives a ton of money from the government, and can't be drafted. solutions would be to end the draft, and make voting only for people who pay taxes. too many people who don't have skin in the game and have realized they can just vote themselves more money. speaking of voting themselves more money, same with government contractors. if you take payment from the government you should not be allowed to donate money to any politician which could in turn give you more contracts. i just feel like the taxpayer is getting screwed as we pay all the tax, do all the work, and get none of the benefits. so cmv, why should people who have no skin in the game get to vote to take my money and use it for their bullshit.
 People who are shot or killed when running from police should not be pitied	a topic that creates a huge storm in american media every time it happens is when someone is killed when fleeing from law enforcement. this tends to be more controversial when the fleeing people are african americans. now, while i do agree that sometimes police tend to have a hair trigger, their job is to protect the public from dangerous people, both real and perceived. no law abiding citizen s first instinct is to book it when the police throw their lights on. it s common sense that fleeing which you will almost never be able successfully do will result in harsher punishment than simply surrendering or complying with law enforcement. so why do they run? it s kind of hard to discuss this topic without race being heavily involved. while i believe anyone who runs from police regardless of race, age, ethnicity, gender, etc should not be sympathized for the repercussions, it s the young black men that make the headlines. this obviously heavily factors into why police are more likely to shoot. there no doubt is a toxic racial tension in the us. so i would expect to hear that black men run because they re scared for their lives. whatever the reason may be, why should i feel sorry for these people who give off the impression that they re potentially dangerous to the public when they run from a routine traffic stop or whatever the situation may be? actions have consequences, and we know what those consequences usually are.
 Caution and concern for oneâ€™s safety should outweigh concerns about being discriminatory	i a white male have walked through lower income neighborhoods that are populated most by minority groups and homeless people. although i am walking during the day when there are other people relatively close by, i get nervous when i pass people on the streets, because the area is known to have higher crime. i will admit that when people in shabby clothing or groups of african american men talking loudly pass me, i am more alert than usual and have a desire to secure my wallet and phone. i recognize that this impulse to secure my valuables and hold my bag tighter has been recognized as a form of bias that disproportionately affects young men of color and the homeless. and i do try very very hard to assume the best of people, trying not to jump to conclusions or implicit bias. however, i also take seriously the possibility of getting mugged, assaulted, or worse. crimes happen, and i have an extremely strong desire not to become a victim of one. the brain at once knows that no harm is likely, but the primal instinct of my brain is to be on alert. the question becomes, is it wrong to take precautions like securing belonging when walking through a low income neighborhood or passing groups of the homeless and primarily young men of color? i recognize that the idea that poor, homeless, and minority people are dangerous criminals is rooted in racism and other prejudices that i work to reject. but at the same time, i think not taking precautions out of a concern for being racist is dangerous: i don t think anyone wants me to become a victim of a crime because i was trying to be inclusive this is quite a foolish thing to do. i don t quite understand how the criticism of caution as prejudice translates into actual action. the reality is that there are bad people out there who commit crimes that tend to be in certain areas by a certain demographic; this isn t a reason to be paranoid, but it is a reason to be smart safety comes before and ought to be compatible with anti discrimination. this is even as a guy; i empathize with women who are at greater risk of sexual assault in similar situations. although i agree that it s wrong to assume all men are rapists, i don t fault women for being ultra alert or concerned about passing men on the street in certain areas. a person s life, health, and possessions are far more important than some intangible idea of social justice; calling that selfish is just insane. help me out here, because this is a real issue i face. are people arguing that it is racist to be cautious? if it is racist, are people seriously suggesting to not be cautious in the name of equality? what do they propose we do? cmv
 : diversity is not our strength	i never understood the phrase, diversity is our greatest strength . nearly every school, workplace, etc with a diverse environment seems to segregate themselves. every race culture of people within that environment will usually group up with each other and favor each other. i don t think this is because racism but because if you grow up in similar cultures, you are far more likely to have something in common with someone. so this brings me to my question, how is diversity our strength? how is sharing little to nothing in common with someone, somehow a strength? and i don t want comments about food , i want actual arguments or examples when diversity accomplished something that a homogenous group of people couldn t. it seems like diversity has only caused culture clashes, racism and general discomfort as people desperately try to fit in or desperately try to be as accepting as possible. it doesn t help that most the people i know who claim to love diversity only experience it in instances of food or fashion, not an actual exchange of ideas or friendship.
 The current protest in Hong Kong is a staggering over reaction fueled largely by irrational interpretation of the proposed extradition law	first of all i completely acknowledge that china is a regime hell bent on suppressing dissent. they would utilize any means, including this proposed extradition law, as a tool to arrest activists critical of china's various issues including human rights and corruption. however, hk's protesters' are not motivated in protecting activists in mainland china. they believe, irrationally, this law is a gateway to suppress freedom of speech in hong kong and anybody is at risk of being extradited to china at whims . the reality is china cannot reasonably request extradition for anybody who was not physically in china at the time of the accused crime. so it is impossible for those who has never been in china to be extradited. for the off chance there are chinese law that covers acts that occurs outside of china which i don't know if there are any such law , they cannot be applicable because those laws would not be in hk's books. which is a requirement for any extradition to take place. unless one believe china will overrun hk's judicial system there is no evidence to believe this is a threat to hk's freedom of speech and freedom in general. please, reddit, cmv.
 Every human being deserves food, water, and shelter even if that requires the government to pay for it.	i live in the usa. i essentially believe any human, regardless of any other circumstances in their life, deserves these three things. why: 1. everyone has the right to life 2. there is more than enough food, water, and shelter, in existing infrastructure to provide this to all citizens. if not, more infrastructure could certainly be built. very cheap affordable government housing would not be that difficult in my opinion. 3. these things are necessary to live healthily. 4. if people do not have to to squabble, steal, cheat, and kill to maintain the necessities of life then they are more likely to devote that time to productive activities for themselves and society. 5. this immediately brings basically everyone above the existing poverty line. decreased poverty is directly correlated with decreased crime and drug use.
 Racism is a spectrum	many people don t believe they re racist simply because they aren t overtly racist. many people are overtly racist. and so, in comparison, if your definition of racism is a guy with a white hood on, that doesn t automatically remove you from the spectrum of being a racist. just because you don t attend clan meetings doesn t mean the policy you support is inherently worse for minorities or people trying to cross borders into other countries. racism is a spectrum, and so long as there is oppression, if you side with oppression, you are on that spectrum. convince me that racism isn t a spectrum, and if you re an agreement that it is a spectrum, where do you draw the line on what is isn t racist.
 White privilege isn't a real thing.	i do not believe white privilege is a real thing, rather i believe it is purely derived from wealth and it just to happens that in the usa and other western countries, a larger percentage of white people are wealthy in comparison to a number of minorities. in an effort to foster discussion about the topic rather than me, i will also say i hold your usual european liberal views on most things, and this is a rare exception. recently, i have been coming across white privilege in the news and other sites such as reddit as a given, a fact. indeed the guardian posted a bunch of statistics from surveys a few months ago about minorities in britain being continually oppressed in every way, of which i believe most of these can be put down to wealth. this is ignoring the fact that the questions were incredibly subjective and were ripe for people to just be bitter about something and blame it on society. another aspect of this is that constantly publishing articles about white privilege creates a divide between white people and minorities who are otherwise completely embedded into society and perhaps don't identify in any way with their original culture. either through resentment or simply creating a culture of 'others' even if the sentiment is well intended. now this isn't to say racism doesn't exist, what i'm denying is the existence of a systematic inequality towards anyone not white. i should also stress that i believe male privilege exists, but i disagree with the notion of white male privilege in terms of a completely assimilated minority male not being included in this privilege too. i appreciate this isn't a fully fledged argument, more a meandering of some thoughts i've had recently. i look forward to reading and replying to all of your responses.
 People with "one drop" of European ancestry should identify as "white" on all government documents and the census.	white is a term of exclusion. the only thing that matters to people that identify as white, ultimately, is skin color. it's certainly not science. i'll offer this real life conversation with white nationalists supremacists as an example of how this term is 'protected' by the interested groups. for other folks that identify as white that aren't bigots, i think they just accept the colloquially used term because while white is a group they can identify with, it's not a true ethnicity in the sense that there is not a homogenous culture, language, set of values, foods, or region associated with individuals who can pass as white. people such as carol channing stand out in stark contrast to barrack obama or tiger woods. the only explanation is that culturally, the only thing that matters is skin color, and so white is conflated with ethnicity, but is actually a term of exclusion that reinforces bigoted notions of white supremacy. the confusion around the difference between white and black which is an ethnicity as i explain here results in the misunderstanding that 'white' people are being marginalized or attacked, when the truth is that their ethnicities are simply being 'white washed' in favor of the less nuanced term that is being promoted by ignorant bigots. what's scary is that this seems to be intentional on the part of white nationalists, and the fact that its working means that as a society we need to do something to demonstrate how dumb this idea actually is. and an important place to start, in my view, is by addressing how one of the main standards for 'whiteness' that is tacitly used is the 'one drop rule' a rule that is only selectively applied to the label 'white'. a label that, if it did refer to an ethnicity, would naturally include both barrack obama and carol channing, amongst many, many others. so rather than pushing against the term, which some people identify with simply because they haven't really thought about it why not go in the opposite direction? we have genetic testing. if a word is going to mean anything, it should be held to the same standard as other words in that category. if 'white' is an ethnicity, then even '1 drop' of european ancestry should qualify anyone to mark that off on the census, on your dl, on job applications, etc. why shouldn't those of us who have been excluded by racists and bigots appropriate this term by virtue of the integrity of how these terms are intended to be used by the professionals in the field that use them? if this is done, there will by necessity come an inflection point where we have to ask if this term is useful at all, because if everyone is 'white' regardless of skin color what the hell is the point in the term? and if it only refers to skin color, then it's implicitly racist and useless and so it has no real world value as a label except for identifying bigots who only care about skin color.
 Being good enough for others is necessary to happiness	people will say 'oh you can be happy even by yourself, you don't need anyone etcetc' which i didn't find true in my life. try living detached from everyone, not getting an ounce of positive feedback from anyone, and feeling like everything that makes you you is just fundamentally wrong and not good enough in anyone's eyes. it's pretty hard to be happy then. you can't just 'not care about' what others think of you when you're not worth enough for anyone to even think about. like, people will say that 'if you're unhappy a relationship won't fix anything', but if i feel like i'm worthless then someone thinking what little redeeming qualities i have make me good enough would disprove that. if no one thinks that then i'm just not worth enough to anyone so i'm worthless. this doesn't just apply to the context of personal relationships, but general societal expectations about being good enough as well, like: being pretty, successful, social, outgoing, fun, funny, 'cool', spontaneous, young, etc. these are just the cumulative results of singular people's opinions about what are good qualities in others anyways. ps: if your answer is 'i don't care about expectations so it's false' that doesn't change my view. everyone wants to be accepted, that's not up for debate. you probably have a ton of support from others taken for granted either way so you don't know what it's like to be in the situation i describe. i wish i could change this view but i'm not sure it's possible so idk, let's try i guess
 The United State is the Greatest Country in The World.	the u. s. a. literally is the best country in the world. they win by a landslide. no other country is even close. here's why: america's foreign policy and military prowess has been, and continues to be, the most important element in combating both left a right wing extremism worldwide. countries that outrank the u. s. a. in things like healthcare and education are only able to do so because america's military has secured the existence of a world in which such things are possible. even if the u. s. a. does not have the best standard of living of any country, they have done more to reduce poverty worldwide both through policy and scientific innovation than any other country. the united states has through policy and scientific innovation done more to fight disease worldwide than any other country. the american revolution provided a blueprint that allowed many other countries to liberate themselves from tyranny and establish successful democracies. tl;dr u. s. a. 1
 Transpeople should not be treated primarily by physicians as having gender dismorphia and should be scrutinized heavily if they wish to have a sexchange.	the reason why i think transpeople should not be regarded as having gender dismorphia initially is because i think it has become sort of like a trend to be trans. because of this, some people will have an identity crisis and assume their miserable lives is because they are the wrong gender when it's something else. from what i've gathered most people realize they're trans as a teen and that is the golden age of identity crises and overall poor mental health so i think you have to be really careful to label someone as trans during that period. i think many people might look for an escape for how they feel and might think being the other gender will make them feel better. anyone seen the show house? he has a limp and chronic pain and he thinks that his life will be good if the pain disappear when in fact it won't since he's alone and stuck in addiction. my point is that many people that feel they're trans might just think their gender is the problem and why their feeling bad when it's something else. most, if not all transpeople i've met have been rather weak people with a bunch of mental ailments and has had this victim mentality. i'm not trying to offend and mind you, i've been not hanging with alot of transpeople but nonetheless that is the impression i have of transpeople for the moment. overall i get the impression that gender dismorphia is some kind of complex identity crisis that manifests itself by making you feel you're the wrong gender. making me wonder if it is a disease that exists right now because of how bizarre our lives is contrary to how they used to be thousands of years ago when we lived in tribes. are there any cases of transpeople through history that has been documented in the last thousand years?
 The Republicans are Philosophically Bankrupt, and are Causing the Collapse of American Democracy (Which was Flawed in the First Place)	so here s my view: the republican party is philosophically bankrupt, and are causing the collapse of american democracy which kind of sucked to begin with to give you a frame of reference of where i m coming from in this argument, i was raised in a centrist household, and heard a lot of political talk in my household get boiled down to the classic both sides do bad things argument, which i, up until a short while ago, took in stride this is something i still believe, but to make the leap and say that both sides are equal is frankly absurd and anyone that believes that really needs to look into the differences between the two parties actions the faustian bargain republicans are philosophically bankrupt, and the fact that people need to be convinced that that s the case is actually strange ever since the republican party s southern strategy in the election of 1964, they have been courting white racists in a bid to build a coalition to rival the democratic one the republicans cleverly tried to repackage anti desegregationism as states rights in order to tow in centre to centre right voters, so as not to appear as the actually racist party this was a faustian bargain that has finally caught up to republicans over half a century later, but it s making our entire country pay for it . the far right exists, since the 1960s, only inside the republican base the far right on their own weren t large enough to make a large coalition in congress, and the republicans couldn t win, at least initially without racists either outright or closeted , and so their alliance was built out of necessity, along with christian conservatives, neo mccarthyists, neocons, libertarians, and corporate interests i m not necessarily saying all those groups are bad, but what has happened is that all those groups have bled into one another the segregationists managed to repackage themselves as traditional values supporters, things which appealed to christian conservatives their militant white nationalist beliefs shifted to being militant about other stuff, like thinking that democrats were socialists and this bled into the modern neocon and neo mccarthyist crowds and in the case of some libertarians, their packaging of states rights spoke directly to supposed small government supporters there has been a slow takeover of a lot of the republican base as the original white supremacists co opted the language of other groups i m not saying every republican elected has been one where a bunch of groups were all puppeted by white supremacists do i think that the bushes or reagan were specifically banking on white supremacy no, not remotely but they did benefit off that faustian bargain, even if they were unknowing about it and this co opting of other political groups language has ensnared a lot of centrists too, who support a lot of really shitty candidates because they think about the economy ! and it s that initial grab of others language that slowly exposes the initially centre to centre right people to the community of farther right people, and eventually, blends the lines between their views this has been greatly accelerated by the advent of the internet . when someone is looking up a political topic video and then are immediately shown a prager u or ben shapiro ad, they are predisposed to looking into that view and the left, usually doesn t do this anywhere near as much as the far right i myself almost fell down the rabbit hole of being an anti sjw free speech advocate, even as i still held the guise of being centre. i know this is true for a lot of other people, because it happened to myself and frankly, the 2016 and even 2018 elections prove that where americans think the political centre is, is actually a lot farther right in some cases than they d like to believe, because in the minds of those centrists they re not conservative, they re just pro free speech, and anti leftist censorship again, co optation of language then you take into account facebook, where we most often are friends with people in our area, and you get conservative areas spiraling into the far right because they can see a vaguely nazist viewpoint repackaged into neutral language, and then without anyone to explicitly say, that sounds kinda racist , they think it s actually normal and so they might share a similar view, or look at some altright talking point video on youtube and then youtube recommends them another one, and another one and oh look, a spiral into nazism we go it s citizen made propaganda and the republicans aren t explicitly to blame for centrists and conservative unknowingly descending into white supremacy, but they did enable that behavior in the first place, and still capitalize off of it happening liberal areas don t have this nearly to the extent of the faux conservatives, and honestly even when they do, it s usually aimed for justice, and being more conscious of societal discrimination, or combatting fascist views of the far right hell, going back to the point on co opting language, just look at what authoritarians have done to the word justice. justice in the practice of governance is usually equated to a couple things, namely equal treatment of individuals often taken in modern contexts to specifically focus on crime , or doing that which is right authoritarians have essentially co opted what justice means for the left when they talk about justice they talk in the framework of justice being a sort of product of liberal social justice warriors to limit free speech . the term sjw is a pejorative term for authoritarians, true conservatives, centrists, and even some one the left back to the point of areas becoming more radicalized, it s been proven that the right has become more radicalized faster than the left right wingers have killed 10 times as many people in terrorist attacks than the left wing. term . bc70a3786224 that statistic comes from a conservative think tank we can even look at the average ideology of congress images housenew. png and you can see that overall, the republican party has radicalized much faster in congress than the democrats deal with the devil, but we pay for it philosophical bankruptcy is a term i don t use lightly, but it s also one i have to define in this case to me, philosophical bankruptcy is essentially ignoring the fundamental enlightenment esque values that our government was built on basically, the idea for our government is that we should firstly, be able to elect a body of representatives that will accurately reflect our societal views, and assure we have a voice in government even if your views are stupid and monstrous, you have a right to have a voice in government if there are enough of you secondly is that we have checks and balances on the political system, and thirdly is that each branch of government should try to find relative common ground to work for most people a roundabout way of saying the government should compromise and work for justice and it shouldn t surprise you that i m going to say that republicans, have not abided by this at all in recent years . over the years, republicans obstructed 71 court nominations, including failing to even hold a vote for merrick garland s supreme court seat republicans blocked health care for 9 11 responders republicans refused support for intervention in the syrian civil war, even after chemical weapons had been used, but conveniently changed their tune once trump took the reins republicans filibustered many bipartisan bills too part of john boehner s and mcconnell s scorched earth approach to never compromise such as student loan affordability, paycheck fairness act, small business tax crs, political finance disclosure disclose , closing loopholes for tax evasion, and incentives for bringing jobs back home so that part of common ground is thrown out of the window and despite this republicans still manage to blame democrats for being obstructionist, even when they re in the minority in the senate and house . and guess what it works virtually everyone in the republican coalition does not care, or genuinely believes that democrats are the real problem in politics this coincides a lot with the anti intellectualism part of republican doctrine they don t care about the overwhelming evidence of climate change they don t care about the fact that immigration is one of the strongest parts of the us economy they don t care about trump decrying all news against him as fake news in fact they don t care about evidence much in general kavanaugh s hearing was depicted on the right as a leftist witch hunt they flat out refuse to protect the investigation of robert mueller, which should honestly be kind of a no brainer just let the man finish his job! they warp and deny reality, and feed into the emotion of irrational bigots who are their audience then you have republicans actively subverting the will of the people and trying to take away power from minorities in the country republicans routinely try to make it harder for people of color to vote under the guise of a threat that doesn t exist but the president continues to perpetuate as the reason he lost the popular vote the whole voter fraud scandal they have tried everything in their power to keep people away from the voting booths and when the vote happens and it s a close race, and an automatic recount is called for, they try and deny it from happening and they tamper with elections even more by actively committing voter fraud and even when they lose, they gerrymandered the country so hard back in 2010 that they still win substantially with less than half the vote . democrats in wisconsin won 53 of the vote, but 36 of seats ohio republicans won 52 of the vote, but 75 of seats north carolina republicans carried 50 of the vote, but 77 of the seats and in texas it was 50 of votes for the republicans, and 64 of seats democrats did this in some states too, which is still extremely bad, but nowhere near the size and scale of the republicans republicans also stole 7 us house seats in the last election. and in wisconsin and in michigan, even when gerrymandering is already prevalent, and republicans lost their respective gubernatorial races, republicans have voted to strip executive powers of the governors and attorney generals. that s nothing short of a power grab that s only legal because there s technically nothing against it . and there s a whole saying for how democrats are supposed to respond they go low, we go high but again, the responsibility of being compromising, rational, and intellectual is left to the party doing far less of the real and lasting damage to our democracy and even when democrats act compromising, they are called obstructionist even when they act rational, they get called unsustainable or idealistic and even when they are intellectual, they get called out on promoting the liberal agenda which i want to point out, no shit that s literally their job, it just so happens that the majority of the liberal agenda is either focused on egalitarianism or science and whenever things go sideways for republicans they claim it either didn t happen or say that whatever it was, wasn t a big deal this has been the case for the last 3 years american democracy was already flawed, republicans just exploited it so the third part of my opinion is that american democracy kind of already sucked, and republicans have just ruthlessly exploited the shortcomings of the founding fathers, and the democrats have been too complacent with the current system they should practically be calling for revolution at this point, but so the slow boil goes the system is super flawed the electoral college is broken and has ruined 50 of the last 4 elections it uses plurality for voting for one thing, which discourages people from voting for whatever candidate they actually want also the popular vote is really more of a suggestion than a guarantee of winning even if you win both the electoral college and popular vote, you can still get your win revoked when the college meets the senate is really stupid really smart for its time, but at the moment really stupid it was made so that geographically diverse areas would stay in the union and have a voice well, we ve kind of solved any secession disputes at this point, and splitting the country up based on geography would be near impossible without cutting corners it gives small states way too much power which literally makes their votes worth far more than those of big states it should really be abolished, since there s not a huge point for it anymore instead double the amount of house representatives, because the current apportionment of people per representative is appalling the current apportionment is per 700,000 people and is also susceptible to gerrymandering, neither or which were an intended feature it started at one rep per 60,000 people doubling it would bring it down to 350,000 maybe we could triple the house size and bring it to 230,000 this problem only gets larger the longer we wait all legislatures should use member based proportional systems. this would also give third parties their actual number of votes they got in the election also there should be a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united, because it s a frankly absurdly undemocratic decision, that also consistently throws elections to whoever can outspend the other person anyways, that was kind of a collection of multiple views, but i hope i gave enough of an indepth explanation
 Indentured servitude should be legalized and de-stigmatized.	it's somewhat common in many parts of the world to have a live in maid, butler, or servant. here in the us, it's not a thing unless you are mega wealthy. last night, i watched a couple documentaries on moldova and one about bangladesh. these people live in extreme poverty, extreme polution, and with little no opportunity to escape. meanwhile, i throw away deli meat that is 2 days old because it smells funny. i think it would be great to have some around the house to clean up, do some landscaping, help with chores, and generally just be a servant. no, i'm not talking about exploiting or abusing them or being some kind of slave driving tyrant. they could help me out with things, and i, in turn, offer them a life in a stable, clean, beautiful part of the world with pay. no, i'm not willing to pay 40k yr for this, but i'm glad to pay for all the essentials room, board, food, medical , plus a reasonable wage for them to live with or send back to their family. it would seem the gut reaction to this is exploitave, and i should be offering some sort of 'fair wage' commensurate of an educated citizen. this just isn't worth it for the type of services being offered. i'm almost certain, no, i'm dead certain, there are millions of people in these impoverished countries who would kill for a situation like this. yet, i can't help but think it's looked down upon. indentured servitude should be opened up for us to at least offer this to people who want to do it. no trafficking, as it's their choice to come and go as they see fit. otherwise, i'll just do it myself, and they can fend for themselves in their own country.
 Online Dating isn't worth it for the average straight man.	for the average straight man, online dating is a pointless exercise. if we look at a popular app, tinder, we can see that 67 of tinder users are men meaning that only 33 are women. this alone indicates that its not possible for all the men on tinder to meet someone. this leads to many men swiping right on women but leaves men with relatively few in return. according to the marketwatch website, men have a match rate of 0. 6 whereas women have a match rate of 10 . another reason that it is pointless is that according to an okcupid study, women rate 80 of men as being below average in attractiveness which skews the matches towards these most attractive men. based on these statistics, i believe that, bar the most attractive men, online dating is a pointless exercise for men that is unlikely to lead to any results and they would likely be better off doing something else with their time. in order to change my mind you'd have to convince me that online dating is a worthwhile exercise for men. disclaimer: this isn't a criticism of women but of online dating. i'm sure most men, if they were in the women's position, would be more selective.
 As a black teenager, Marvel's way of bringing "diversity" is insulting and patronizing	first off, yes i am black. it's sad that i even have to say this. when i talk about this elsewhere, i'm called a racist, but as soon as i throw this fact out, the narrative totally changes. the way marvel has gone around race swapping and gender bending characters for 'diversity' is complete bs. there are so many black and female characters in the comics. marvel has been around since world war two, and they have plenty to choose from. but instead, they decided to do this and say 'you need representation' what is this? they can pick unique characters like monica rambeau and put them in, which fits their narrative, but then they'll needlessly change the appearance for 'diversity'. it's so insulting, as a young black man, to be told that i can only relate to characters that look like me. and it's even worse that they take historically white characters, and say 'here you go, accept this or you're racist'. marvel doesn't care about people like me. they only see signs. they can't even bring in enough original characters despite decades of source material. they change white to black which is basically a damn hand me down . it's like us black people are just trophies to show off for them. 'hey, look here, we have a black guy! a woman! ' and their commitment to this is highly questionable. monica rambeau was turned into a child, looking up to carol danvers. i've read that rambeau was going to continue looking up to danvers, and take inspiration from her, which is bs. we're finally getting blade and got black panther, and that's really it. falcon taking the captain america mantel takes away what made him falcon. and how they treated black characters before is absolutely horrible. darwin from the x men is near omega level, and he was killed off early. and don't get me started on the female characters. black widow was literally fridged killing off female characters to give the men some sort of character arc . i cannot stand with this anymore
 We shouldn't abolish the binary gender system for a minority of people who don't fit into it.	i'm not sure of the exact percentage, because i haven't found one after searching for quite a long time. however, a very small minority of people let's generously put it at 3 4 are non binary. changing the entire binary system for a small percentage is unnecessary and requires a lot of work, change and complete overturning of many systems. changing the entire world for a tiny minority is absolutely senseless. in fact, i'll demonstrate around 10 of the world's population are sociopaths. does that mean we should change all of our systems related to empathy and on top of that, every time we see a person 'never assume his her emotional status! ' it seems absurd to change that, although 10 is a huge number. why should non binary people get the entire world at their feet, changing, when other minorities are not given this opportunity to change the entire world to center around them? for good reason not to mention that sex and gender play a very important role in society. sex, both for medical reasons and roles in society, and gender for a sense of identity. something that's very important. i'd like to address the fact that not changing the world for them doesn't mean not accepting them. of course we accept that people can be non binary and that it is a legitimate identity, but to change how society and the world works because of that is absurd. what we should do is increase acceptance for them.
 the only way to solve racism is organizing everyone on Earth into entirely different continents based on ethnicity	there are studies that indicate that even freshly newborn infants have a strong preference for babies of their own ethnicity. this means that all humans are inherently racist. evolutionarily speaking, fear of anything different aided survival. multiculturalism is a relatively new concept. for thousands of years, humans survived by staying the hell away from anyone who didn't look like themselves. given all of these factors, my conclusion is that the only way to 100 eliminate racism is to restrict interaction between the races to the absolute degree. for example, all the hispanics on earth could take south america, all the natives can take north america, whites go to australia, blacks have the sole rights to africa, asians have eurasia, etc. this way, there are entire oceans between ethnic groups. someone can't be racist if they don't even know other races exist. oh yeah and everyone has to stay in their own land. no intercontinental travel since simply knowing other lands exist would make whites want to take that land and its resources, starting the cycle of colonization and racism again. tl;dr: people are inherently racist. therefore, the only way to combat racism is to make it so nobody ever interacts with any race besides their own ever again until the end of time.
 The modern women's march is a directionless movement and to liken it to the suffragette movement is completely absurd	i say this as i am hoping reddit can help me better understand why this movement has taken the form it has and what it stands for present day. to me the suffragette movement had clearly defined goals of establishing a woman's right to vote, the modern movement seems to just point to generally sensed male oppression and perceived threats to policies they value. i attended the 2018 women's march and asked around to see what the most pressing issues were and abortion was almost unanimously the most pressing issue which was interesting to me given my understanding that they are still legal and nothing is being circulated at this point to revoke that right. so all told i am open to having my mind changed, please fill me in on what i'm missing! also i really hope to avoid toxicity, i know this is a touchy topic but triggering discomfort is not my aim, i'm here to learn not offend
 The Republicans are Philosophically Bankrupt, and are Causing the Collapse of American Democracy (Which was Flawed in the First Place)	so here s my view: the republican party is philosophically bankrupt, and are causing the collapse of american democracy which kind of sucked to begin with to give you a frame of reference of where i m coming from in this argument, i was raised in a centrist household, and heard a lot of political talk in my household get boiled down to the classic both sides do bad things argument, which i, up until a short while ago, took in stride this is something i still believe, but to make the leap and say that both sides are equal is frankly absurd and anyone that believes that really needs to look into the differences between the two parties actions the faustian bargain republicans are philosophically bankrupt, and the fact that people need to be convinced that that s the case is actually strange ever since the republican party s southern strategy in the election of 1964, they have been courting white racists in a bid to build a coalition to rival the democratic one the republicans cleverly tried to repackage anti desegregationism as states rights in order to tow in centre to centre right voters, so as not to appear as the actually racist party this was a faustian bargain that has finally caught up to republicans over half a century later, but it s making our entire country pay for it . the far right exists, since the 1960s, only inside the republican base the far right on their own weren t large enough to make a large coalition in congress, and the republicans couldn t win, at least initially without racists either outright or closeted , and so their alliance was built out of necessity, along with christian conservatives, neo mccarthyists, neocons, libertarians, and corporate interests i m not necessarily saying all those groups are bad, but what has happened is that all those groups have bled into one another the segregationists managed to repackage themselves as traditional values supporters, things which appealed to christian conservatives their militant white nationalist beliefs shifted to being militant about other stuff, like thinking that democrats were socialists and this bled into the modern neocon and neo mccarthyist crowds and in the case of some libertarians, their packaging of states rights spoke directly to supposed small government supporters there has been a slow takeover of a lot of the republican base as the original white supremacists co opted the language of other groups i m not saying every republican elected has been one where a bunch of groups were all puppeted by white supremacists do i think that the bushes or reagan were specifically banking on white supremacy no, not remotely but they did benefit off that faustian bargain, even if they were unknowing about it and this co opting of other political groups language has ensnared a lot of centrists too, who support a lot of really shitty candidates because they think about the economy ! and it s that initial grab of others language that slowly exposes the initially centre to centre right people to the community of farther right people, and eventually, blends the lines between their views this has been greatly accelerated by the advent of the internet . when someone is looking up a political topic video and then are immediately shown a prager u or ben shapiro ad, they are predisposed to looking into that view and the left, usually doesn t do this anywhere near as much as the far right i myself almost fell down the rabbit hole of being an anti sjw free speech advocate, even as i still held the guise of being centre. i know this is true for a lot of other people, because it happened to myself and frankly, the 2016 and even 2018 elections prove that where americans think the political centre is, is actually a lot farther right in some cases than they d like to believe, because in the minds of those centrists they re not conservative, they re just pro free speech, and anti leftist censorship again, co optation of language then you take into account facebook, where we most often are friends with people in our area, and you get conservative areas spiraling into the far right because they can see a vaguely nazist viewpoint repackaged into neutral language, and then without anyone to explicitly say, that sounds kinda racist , they think it s actually normal and so they might share a similar view, or look at some altright talking point video on youtube and then youtube recommends them another one, and another one and oh look, a spiral into nazism we go it s citizen made propaganda and the republicans aren t explicitly to blame for centrists and conservative unknowingly descending into white supremacy, but they did enable that behavior in the first place, and still capitalize off of it happening liberal areas don t have this nearly to the extent of the faux conservatives, and honestly even when they do, it s usually aimed for justice, and being more conscious of societal discrimination, or combatting fascist views of the far right hell, going back to the point on co opting language, just look at what authoritarians have done to the word justice. justice in the practice of governance is usually equated to a couple things, namely equal treatment of individuals often taken in modern contexts to specifically focus on crime , or doing that which is right authoritarians have essentially co opted what justice means for the left when they talk about justice they talk in the framework of justice being a sort of product of liberal social justice warriors to limit free speech . the term sjw is a pejorative term for authoritarians, true conservatives, centrists, and even some one the left back to the point of areas becoming more radicalized, it s been proven that the right has become more radicalized faster than the left right wingers have killed 10 times as many people in terrorist attacks than the left wing. term . bc70a3786224 that statistic comes from a conservative think tank we can even look at the average ideology of congress images housenew. png and you can see that overall, the republican party has radicalized much faster in congress than the democrats deal with the devil, but we pay for it philosophical bankruptcy is a term i don t use lightly, but it s also one i have to define in this case to me, philosophical bankruptcy is essentially ignoring the fundamental enlightenment esque values that our government was built on basically, the idea for our government is that we should firstly, be able to elect a body of representatives that will accurately reflect our societal views, and assure we have a voice in government even if your views are stupid and monstrous, you have a right to have a voice in government if there are enough of you secondly is that we have checks and balances on the political system, and thirdly is that each branch of government should try to find relative common ground to work for most people a roundabout way of saying the government should compromise and work for justice and it shouldn t surprise you that i m going to say that republicans, have not abided by this at all in recent years . over the years, republicans obstructed 71 court nominations, including failing to even hold a vote for merrick garland s supreme court seat republicans blocked health care for 9 11 responders republicans refused support for intervention in the syrian civil war, even after chemical weapons had been used, but conveniently changed their tune once trump took the reins republicans filibustered many bipartisan bills too part of john boehner s and mcconnell s scorched earth approach to never compromise such as student loan affordability, paycheck fairness act, small business tax crs, political finance disclosure disclose , closing loopholes for tax evasion, and incentives for bringing jobs back home so that part of common ground is thrown out of the window and despite this republicans still manage to blame democrats for being obstructionist, even when they re in the minority in the senate and house . and guess what it works virtually everyone in the republican coalition does not care, or genuinely believes that democrats are the real problem in politics this coincides a lot with the anti intellectualism part of republican doctrine they don t care about the overwhelming evidence of climate change they don t care about the fact that immigration is one of the strongest parts of the us economy they don t care about trump decrying all news against him as fake news in fact they don t care about evidence much in general kavanaugh s hearing was depicted on the right as a leftist witch hunt they flat out refuse to protect the investigation of robert mueller, which should honestly be kind of a no brainer just let the man finish his job! they warp and deny reality, and feed into the emotion of irrational bigots who are their audience then you have republicans actively subverting the will of the people and trying to take away power from minorities in the country republicans routinely try to make it harder for people of color to vote under the guise of a threat that doesn t exist but the president continues to perpetuate as the reason he lost the popular vote the whole voter fraud scandal they have tried everything in their power to keep people away from the voting booths and when the vote happens and it s a close race, and an automatic recount is called for, they try and deny it from happening and they tamper with elections even more by actively committing voter fraud and even when they lose, they gerrymandered the country so hard back in 2010 that they still win substantially with less than half the vote . democrats in wisconsin won 53 of the vote, but 36 of seats ohio republicans won 52 of the vote, but 75 of seats north carolina republicans carried 50 of the vote, but 77 of the seats and in texas it was 50 of votes for the republicans, and 64 of seats democrats did this in some states too, which is still extremely bad, but nowhere near the size and scale of the republicans republicans also stole 7 us house seats in the last election. and in wisconsin and in michigan, even when gerrymandering is already prevalent, and republicans lost their respective gubernatorial races, republicans have voted to strip executive powers of the governors and attorney generals. that s nothing short of a power grab that s only legal because there s technically nothing against it . and there s a whole saying for how democrats are supposed to respond they go low, we go high but again, the responsibility of being compromising, rational, and intellectual is left to the party doing far less of the real and lasting damage to our democracy and even when democrats act compromising, they are called obstructionist even when they act rational, they get called unsustainable or idealistic and even when they are intellectual, they get called out on promoting the liberal agenda which i want to point out, no shit that s literally their job, it just so happens that the majority of the liberal agenda is either focused on egalitarianism or science and whenever things go sideways for republicans they claim it either didn t happen or say that whatever it was, wasn t a big deal this has been the case for the last 3 years american democracy was already flawed, republicans just exploited it so the third part of my opinion is that american democracy kind of already sucked, and republicans have just ruthlessly exploited the shortcomings of the founding fathers, and the democrats have been too complacent with the current system they should practically be calling for revolution at this point, but so the slow boil goes the system is super flawed the electoral college is broken and has ruined 50 of the last 4 elections it uses plurality for voting for one thing, which discourages people from voting for whatever candidate they actually want also the popular vote is really more of a suggestion than a guarantee of winning even if you win both the electoral college and popular vote, you can still get your win revoked when the college meets the senate is really stupid really smart for its time, but at the moment really stupid it was made so that geographically diverse areas would stay in the union and have a voice well, we ve kind of solved any secession disputes at this point, and splitting the country up based on geography would be near impossible without cutting corners it gives small states way too much power which literally makes their votes worth far more than those of big states it should really be abolished, since there s not a huge point for it anymore instead double the amount of house representatives, because the current apportionment of people per representative is appalling the current apportionment is per 700,000 people and is also susceptible to gerrymandering, neither or which were an intended feature it started at one rep per 60,000 people doubling it would bring it down to 350,000 maybe we could triple the house size and bring it to 230,000 this problem only gets larger the longer we wait all legislatures should use member based proportional systems. this would also give third parties their actual number of votes they got in the election also there should be a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united, because it s a frankly absurdly undemocratic decision, that also consistently throws elections to whoever can outspend the other person anyways, that was kind of a collection of multiple views, but i hope i gave enough of an indepth explanation
 The Only Reason Black Panther Is Nominated as Best Picture Is to Get More Viewers	so i had friends over the other day and this nomination came up in a conversation about the mcu, and how black panther was unworthy of it, especially considering how, from us marvel fans' standpoint, infinity war was immensely superior in quality and significance. i've heard similar comments from people on r marvel, on youtube, and on various facebook groups marvel subs. i'm no stranger to the significance black panther have had in the black community, and it is my understanding that people are kinda blaming the academy for taking an 'obvious' political stance by nominating black panther, a seemingly undeserving movie, as best picture. perhaps i'm overestimating how much attention this is getting due to my over involvement in marvel stuff, but i am convinced that the academy is not making a political statement at all; they simply want to attract more viewership. they know the political significance of the movie, and they also know the quality of movies. they know exactly what movie deserves a nomination; movies have literally been at the center of their job, and main hobby, their whole life. they know their shit. and they know that moviegoers know their shit too: black panther is not award worthy. i mean it sure is, it was a great movie, with a great story, a great soundtrack, good acting and badass visuals. but it's not best picture worthy. the only instances i've heard of the oscars this year have been black panther related. many different viewpoints, per usual. all of them have some good, some bad. 'the academy just want to push black agenda more. the awards don't mean shit anymore. ' 'black panther was significant for many communities. it deserves to be nominated for the way it impacted our society. ' 'infinity war was better. ' 'blackkklansman was better. ' 'enough with the shitty superhero movies. are you guys 10? ' one thing all these opinions have in common: they give awareness to the oscars. that's it. the academy obviously has people working in marketing. and these people's job is getting more money views for the ceremony. and they are professionally trained. and they are often extremely smart. nominating black panther was not a political move, it was a business move. and it worked; people are talking about it, which creates brand awareness . the academy wins. black panther's creators win. disney wins. everyone wins. except all of us who debate this and get 'divided' by this. amp; x200b; p. s. pepsi and gilette did it better. same exact principle. create an ambiguous ad with politically charged content and let people spread your brand's name like herpes. they aim at one thing: profit . and they succeed. p. p. s. i am aware that this post contributes to what i think is a problem, but it's an opinion i never see discussed anywhere.
 As long as Conservatives maintain any significant level of federal power, meaningful action to curb climate change is impossible in the US	right now, american conservatives are firmly in the camp of inaction when it comes to climate change. their actual beliefs on it vary from hard soft denialism it's not real it's not human caused , to wishful thinking the effects won't be that bad and we'll adapt , all the way to nihilism it's too late expensive to do anything , but practically all agree that no significant action should be taken to curb it. this is evidenced by many leading conservative voices, but most prominently by president trump who has made trolling the left on climate change a regular habit. and conservatives seem to near universally praise him for it to the point that the few who criticize him are aggressively silenced. this is all in spite of the overwhelming evidence that man made climate change is real and could have potentially catastrophic impacts. whether it's tidal flooding in miami, historic level wildfires becoming a regular occurrence on the west coast even in years with high levels of rainfall and snowpack , or the fact that 9 10 of the globally hottest years on record have occurred since 2000, even ordinary people can point to things that should convince any reasonable person of this. for this reason, i can only conclude that there is nothing that will change their stance on climate change, at least not in the 10 year time frame this is the time frame according to the ipccs roadmap we have to start taking aggressive action to curb it. at this point, they seem to have become so ideologically opposed to action on climate change that it now forms a fundamental part of their identity. i know i've used some rather vague terms here, so let me clarify below: meaningful action: according to the ipcc, between 2020 2030, countries around the world need to start doing things like implementing 50 ton carbon taxes, heavily invest in research in clean energy and low carbon manufacturing processes, take carbon capture and sequestration ccs technology from being essentially lab experiments to pulling hundreds of millions of tons of co2 out of the atmosphere every year, and reach near carbon neutrality for developed western countries. this is what i mean. significant federal power: any amount of federal power that could be used to block the passage or implementation of legislative or executive action to the above effect in any of the 3 branches. essentially, i believe they must become effectively irrelevant. please note: i am not and do not advocate violence towards or political repression of conservatives. rather, i'm saying that meaningful action is essentially impossible in the us because of this. i desperately do not want to believe that so long as 1 2 of americans have a relevant political voice, such action is impossible. please cmv.
 America should not be allied with Europe. European citizens HATE America. And European politicians do nothing but try to undermine the American president.	america should not be allied with europe. european citizens hate america. and european politicians do nothing but try to undermine the american president. seriously europeans sure seem to hate america for supposed 'allies' i mean from the looks of things the russians and the chinese love america far more when are europeans supposed 'allies' seriously. we don't really need europe. our primary trade partner is china. you're up. and america sims more money to europe then it would ever receive back. america is the primary funder of the un and if the european defense. america doesn't really need europe but they sure need america imagine trying to fuund 'free' health care if they had to pay for your own military? but really. what ifwe partnered with countries that like us? if america dropped europe and allied with russia and china it would be over. it'll be the three countries that took over the world. we have far more influence over chinese policies as an ally meaning we could lobby for better working conditions for their people and even for better environmental policies from the number one polluting country. and if china russia and america were allies it would be over. europe would be nothing. we could divide up the middle east oil and cut you're a completely out of the deal. and china and russia have far more to offer the united states then europe did as far as i'm concerned if i supposed ally literally hates our country but the people of china are protesting waving american flags and the people of russia clearly love america then it seems pretty clear who the allies really are especially when european politicians do nothing but try to undermine the american president and china and russia are more than willing to negotiate with him besides. europeans hate america. it would be best for everybody if we just ll cut our losses and renegotiated what countries are allied with who
 /r/conspiracy should be banned for harassing survivors of mass shootings	r itsajaguar eplained in succulent detail how absolutely fuckedup conspiracy theorists really are. hook father dies in apparent suicide ejcha31 ? st jtpaebn4 amp;sh 6e9f49fb reddit banned fat people shaming, yes it's a bit unethical, but a trivial crime. it banned loli images, fine not tasteful, but it doesn't harm anyone. they then banned gore sites while leaving literal hate speech site alone. now fuckheads on r conspiracy are actually claiming all the shooting related suicides are fake and will inevitably lead to harassment as they always do. we get it, reddit doesn't actually give a shit about morals. the most popular sub could be about praising men who beat their wives on a daily basis and reddit wouldn't care unless it chased away advertisers. but at least try to pretend you have a minimum sense of taste and delete the shitstain that is r conspiracy before it inevitably leads to more harassment of ptsd survivors.
 *Women* are subhuman compared to men! Despite being incompetent or weak they often have better lives than their male counterparts!	gt; 1 why do you hold your view? include any experiences or other background information that may have led to its formation. i hold my view because i observe it every where and essentially every minute. i think weak and incompetent people don't deserve happy lives. women find themselves in positions of life that real hard workers would kill for. and they are malicious about it, as oppose to being greatful and humble. and this maliciousness if defended and sometimes encouraged against men who very obviously have it harder. the best 'anecdotal' evidence i have is the fact that mgotws, red pillers, incels, and the hapas subreddits all seem to come to the same conclusion that women's bevaior is predictable and often 'samey'. not similar. the exact same language and actions along with the rationalizations. the whole npc thing applies to women by in large. keep in mind those subreddits have very different views from one another. they aren't at all a monolith yet they have found common ground on one thing. ok. so. why? gt; 2 do you know what might change your view? is there anything specific about common counter arguments that you find unconvincing? the most common counter arguments are usually whiteknighting, ad hominen attacks, and poisoning the well. the ones that delve deeper are often ethereal egalitarianism. 'but like puffs blunt we're all equal, man. ' i'd gladly change my view if someone could answer these questions not even all of them, just some : did you know that women have less grey matter as well as less brain mass? do you know what grey matter does? bonus: why are these facts so uncommon and seemingly surpressed? if you look up articles you get conflicting answer but if you look at scientific studies they're all transparent and consentient. why are there different chess leagues for men and women? chess is a mental game, no? bonus: why isn't this fact more common? if you tell people this most of them are surprised. you know that women are physcially weaker but do you know how much? why are there more male to female transgenders than vice versa? is it easier to be a woman somehow? why or why not? did you know that early humans reproduced at a rate of 18 females to 1 male? what do you think of that? why does it appear that women select the 'top' men, indiscriminant of their 'bad' personality traits? assuming this was true, would it matter to you? what do you make of tinder experiments? what do you make of the phenomenon known as 'chadfishing'? do these 'experiments' hold any water to you? let's say there was a random race of people who had green skin. all the men in this race had less grey matter than average and were physically weaker than every other race. how would people react to these individuals? should they be equal with the races that are superior in everyway? ok. would you expect them to be in better affairs than the other races. should a person succeed in life becuase they are goodlooking? should they go beyond succeeding? for example, getting away with a crime? are you aware that women get lighter sentences even for the same crime as men? do you think there is a bias in favor of women? bonus: if there is what is to be done about it.
 Timothy McVeigh, while technically a domestic terrorist, should be an inspiration to the working class, the underpowered, and the unheard.	i'd like to preface this by saying that murder is rarely justifiable, and even more rarely is it justifiable to murder a child. timothy mcveigh is not innocent, or morally good, and i don't wish for this to precede from the false pretense that i think what he did was harmless, or morally correct. for the unfamiliar, timothy mcveigh is a domestic terrorist responsible for the oklahoma city bombing. the bombing happened april 19th, 1995, and killed 168 people, including 25 children. the target was the alfred p. murrah federal building, and housed fourteen federal agencies, including the dea, atf, social security administration, and recruiting offices for the army and marine corps. the attack was carried out in protest to the waco siege, the ruby ridge incident, and an act of retaliation against what tim saw as a tyrannical, oppressive government. that's the short and sweet of it, but there's a lot more to the story if you ever want to look into it. however, i believe that this act is inspirational in a number of ways. first and foremost, the attack was carried out almost exclusively by himself. two co conspirators helped him gather supplies, but refused to help him construct the bomb, position it, or set it off. additionally, the response to the bombing the deadliest act of terrorism in the u. s. until 9 11, and still the deadliest act of domestic terrorism brought the federal government to a screeching halt for about a day and a half. and this was all done by one man. nonviolent protest is wonderful, but sometimes it just doesn't work. if one disgruntled guy with some books, and two friends, could bring the government to a stop for a day and a half, imagine what an citizen's revolt could accomplish. this is mostly in reference to the things going on in hong kong. i completely understand the idea behind nonviolent, peaceful protest, but when it doesn't work, sometimes you might need to grab a book and some friends, and rent a truck.
 Loot Boxes in video games should not be regulated by the government any differently than other in-game microtransactions.	loot boxes in video games are an extremely hot topic in the gaming community after some frankly ridiculous statements being made by large publishers regarding their place in the industry. what i m surprised by while browsing the comments of these kinds of articles and videos is how strongly people want loot boxes to be strangled by regulation, with many calling for outright bans on loot box implementations in general. first, we can all agree that loot boxes absolutely, positively suck for gaming consumers. it s not good game design, and a game having a loot box implementation is pretty much a death sentence in terms of my interest in picking it up. consumers should be extremely wary of video games with loot box implementations and judge very carefully whether the implementation is mild enough for them to enjoy the game without being suckered in by them, as they can very easily ruin a video game. however, loot boxes being a shitty, detrimental business practice isn t enough of a reason for laws to be put in place to curtail or ban them. if loot boxes are selling to the point where they re profitable despite the backlash and boycotting being done against them, then consumers kind of deserve the shitty aaa industry that they re being presented and more purist gamers like myself should look elsewhere. to me, loot boxes are just another form of micro transactions that are wrapped ha in a mystery box gimmick, so they should just be regulated to the same degree that we regulate other forms of micro transactions that is, not very much and call it a day. in addition, the notion that regulation is the only way to deal with this issue seems a bit ham fisted. to compare the loot box issue to the video game violence issue, the threat of legislation and regulation was enough to get a gaming industry that was getting unethical content in front of children to create the esrb and essentially regulate themselves. to the political, legal world, loot boxes are still a relatively new problem, so it would be remiss of us to start regulating before governments are able to have a discord with the publishers involved and give them an opportunity to rectify their actions. it would be an extremely late, hypocritically self preservation based rectification, but it would be one that would allow companies to figure out how to create more mild versions of loot boxes that gamers can grudgingly accept rather than throwing out the baby with the bathwater. what will not cmv is any discussion about how much loot boxes are killing the games industry. yes. i know. companies are allowed to be garbage as long as they re not doing anything outright illegal, and it s up to us as consumers to decide when enough is enough and let our wallets do the talking. the main reason why i m writing this post is due to the black and white vitriol i kept getting shut down with whenever i tried to have nuanced discussions about the loot box issues on other threads. what would absolutely cmv would be a discussion about very specific aspects of loot boxes that cross that line of being merely shitty into actual illegal dangerous behaviour and should be regulated as a result. i can certainly think of several aspects of loot boxes that are on the verge of crossing this line, but none of them ever quite get over it for me. some common ones: loot boxes are a form of gambling and should be regulated as such: this is the one i have the most conflicting opinions about. on one hand, i understand how the extremely addictive nature of loot boxes are detrimental to children and should be looked at. on the other, loot box like mechanics are rampant in the toy industry already. from trading cards to capsule gacha machines to mystery boxes like lootcrate, there are already a wealth of children s pastimes that, by the same loot box logic, are equivalent to gambling, and i think you would be much harder pressed to find people that feel the need to regulate those as gambling industries. loot boxes are unfairly tarketing children: this is probably the most valid point in terms of regulation, but at the same time this issue is not loot box specific and points to problems that simply banning loot boxes would not solve. if we re so apt to make the loot boxes gambling comparison, why isn t the esrb getting involved and using loot box implementations as a factor when determining their age ratings? to my knowledge, the eu already has laws that handle the tone and content that general micro transactions can have when being advertised. why would we make loot box specific legislation instead of just making sure loot boxes don t break the existing ones, updating accordingly? i m very interested to see where this conversation goes. as i stated, i hate loot boxes as much as the next guy. i just don t buy the case that they re a legitimate threat that deserves as much government regulation as the gaming community is asking for. tl;dr: i hate loot boxes, but i m not convinced that there s a case for there to be as subject to regulation as the gaming community wants. cmv

' i'd gladly change my view if someone could answer these questions not even all of them, just some : did you know that women have less grey matter as well as less brain mass? do you know what grey matter does? bonus: why are these facts so uncommon and seemingly surpressed? if you look up articles you get conflicting answer but if you look at scientific studies they're all transparent and consentient. why are there different chess leagues for men and women? chess is a mental game, no? bonus: why isn't this fact more common? if you tell people this most of them are surprised. you know that women are physcially weaker but do you know how much? why are there more male to female transgenders than vice versa? is it easier to be a woman somehow? why or why not? did you know that early humans reproduced at a rate of 18 females to 1 male? what do you think of that? why does it appear that women select the 'top' men, indiscriminant of their 'bad' personality traits? assuming this was true, would it matter to you? what do you make of tinder experiments? what do you make of the phenomenon known as 'chadfishing'? do these 'experiments' hold any water to you? let's say there was a random race of people who had green skin. all the men in this race had less grey matter than average and were physically weaker than every other race. how would people react to these individuals? should they be equal with the races that are superior in everyway? ok. would you expect them to be in better affairs than the other races. should a person succeed in life becuase they are goodlooking? should they go beyond succeeding? for example, getting away with a crime? are you aware that women get lighter sentences even for the same crime as men? do you think there is a bias in favor of women? bonus: if there is what is to be done about it.
 Blackmail shouldnâ€™t be illegal as long as the blackmailed follows through on their end of the deal AND no illegal threats are involved	if someone blackmails someone with the threat of posting their dirty pictures online that should not be illegal in my opinion unless the blackmailed is underage, in which case it s intent to distribute and possession of child porn, not blackmail . blackmail in laymen terms is if you do a, i won t do b b being someone that will hurt the individual . this is a normal exchange of services goods. e. g. if you don t work i won t pay your salary and you won t be able to feed your family. the only difference being that in the salary case, there is a legal binding that says the person must be payed what they re if they do work address s in the next point . what should be illegal in my opinion, would be a failure to follow through with the deal. for example if someone asks you for 200 to not tell your wife you cheated on her, you pay them, and they continue to ask for money or tell her anyways, that is theft as they have taken your money without delivering their service in return. if something that can harm you falls in the wrong hands, then you were reckless and it s your own goddamn fault, so you pay up if you don t want it to be known by anybody else. to address some common arguments: i do not considered he argument but it hurts the person being blackmailed, so it should be illegal being valid as it hurts that person equally as much or more so to divulge their compromising information without asking for money and that s perfectly legal. also, saying that my solution force the blackmailer to follow through on their promises is not good enough as it is very hard to enforce by the police is equally dismissible as blackmail crimes are also very difficult to prosecute most are done via the internet, where s it incredibly simple to remain anonymous while messaging the victim i used money to express what is usually asked for but this can stand for anything that s not illegal yes, even having sexual relations, but only if total, unregulated prostitution is legal in the place where the blackmail is happening, if not, i would consider that soliciting sex in exchange for a good or service which could be prosecuted as such
 Equality is absurd	the idea that people are equal or at least that they should be treated as such seems to be very strong in today s society this is for example illustrated by the large feminist movement, advocating for gender equality . the idea is that we should not discriminate against people based on certain personal attributes, such as sex, age, religion, ethnicity etc we should all be treated equally and should have be given the same opportunities irrespective of these particular attributes. this narrative does not make sense to me. we are all individuals with different personal attributes and discriminating against people based on these attributes makes perfect sense. the narrative that we are all equal is therefore absurd. my reasoning longer explanation is as follows we are all unique individuals all categorizations labels of people are simplifications of reality that help us conveniently put people in different compartments. however, people are individuals and are not merely defined by these categories. ultimately, we are all unique individuals; we all have different sets of attributes. the list of attributes can be made very infinitely long, but here are some basic examples: height weight sex ethnicity confidence aggressiveness etc discrimination makes sense our personal attributes give us certain proficiencies skills. the fact that we all have different sets of attributes means that we have different proficiencies skills. thus, in certain situations, where a particular attribute gives a person an advantage, it makes sense to discriminate based on this attribute. take the height attribute for example. a tall person is better equipped to reach apples high up in a tree than a shorter person. a shorter person, on the other hand, is better equipped to hide in a small bush. now, if we need to pluck apples from a high tree, it makes sense to assign that task to the taller person. thus, discrimination based on personal attributes makes sense. my view in a nutshell tl;dr : we are all individuals with different sets of personal attributes. discriminating against people based on their personal attributes makes sense and we do this all the time . thus, we are all intrinsically unequal we all have different opportunities in life . the narrative that we are all equal is therefore absurd. cmv
 Solving a Rubik's cube in the fewest moves is far a more impressive intellectual feat than solving it quickly	i will preface this by saying that i have nothing against speedcubing and speedcubers. it is highly impressive that people can solve scrambled cubes in a matter of seconds, and i respect all those who dedicate their lives to mastering the art of solving them quickly. there is no denying that it takes a huge amount of training, skill, and manual dexterity to become a competitive speedcuber. that being said, i believe that being able to solve any given permutation of the cube in the fewest moves is a far more impressive intellectual feat and one that should be valued more in competitions . speedcubers are fast because they can recognise patterns quickly and are able to apply memorised algorithms. this takes a lot of practice, but is ultimately a question of experience. as you become more familiar with different permutations of the cube, you develop a 'feel' for which algorithms to apply and can rapidly execute them as a result. on the other hand, i am under the impression that fewest move solves are much more difficult to master, since there are no fixed 'solving methods' for any given arrangement of the cube. it becomes an exercise in trying to develop your own algorithms on the fly so as to minimise the number of moves you will need, as opposed to an exercise in quickly applying algorithms that you have already memorised. in a sense this makes it more like solving a rubik's cube 'au naturel' without having read up on algorithms at all a task that very few would be able to accomplish. in my view this makes it much more intellectually stimulating and challenging than speedsolving, and is why i believe that fewest move solves should be the centrepiece of rubik's cube competitions. cmv.
 Conservatives arenâ€™t funny	i guess the most obvious angle here is that there s no politically conservative equivalent of jon stewart. no one on late night tv is getting laughs with witty defenses of trump or mitch mcconnell. when someone does make a funny and insightful joke at the expense of a democrat, that person is usually a liberal themselves, as some brands of humor are reflective and self deprecating, and because their fellow liberals are also capable of some of the same hypocrisy and idiocy as conservatives. jim jefferies got famous off the back of a bit skewering the second amendment, and i ve personally witnessed conservatives laughing at and enjoying parts of it. i m not aware of anyone who hilariously defended unfettered gun rights. even the political cartoons and memes on the right suck. it s all just simplistic ha ha, those liberals are easily triggered by our beliefs circle jerking, or else it s just blunt cruelty. am i missing something? is there a secret world of conservative hilarity out there?
 Iâ€™m a nativist	i m a nativist. i think it is in the interests of western civilization to exclude large populations of foreign born immigrants. much of the world s population doesn t have secondary education. inevitably that leads to them coming to western countries, and working for low wages, earning a salary below the poverty line, raising children in that poverty, their children often suffering such similar poverty as adults, and creating ethnic ghettos. it is true some migrant children escape such environments, but it has lead to ghettoization in reality. and because of such poverty, it is hard to interact with the natives of those countries. and therefore it is difficult to assimilate. i think that since many foreign immigrants are so different, if any significant population of a particular foreign group develops in a country, they will start to self segregate and form an identity that blocks assimilation into their new country. more specifically, i think this is a threat to traditional western culture. so for the united states, valuing things like the constitution, the founders of the united states, individualism, the spirit of free inquiry are in decline, and part of the reason is the large immigrant population. for britain i imagine valuing their westminster system, english literature, and the ideal of the gentleman are important to their culture. but on the other hand i think this is ultimately a threat to western society itself, as the various factors of poverty, ghettoization, non assimilation continue, this will lead to balkanization of western societies. if say a third of britain became pakistani, that would lead to balkanization. society would end up being divided into ethnic enclaves. one might say cultural enrichment is what makes immigration valuable. but i might also add cultural enrichment isn t enough. i think if a chinese immigrant comes to england or america and hangs a portrait of mao tse tung on their wall, that s a bad thing. that shouldn t happen. cultural imports can be good or bad, and i think overall immigrants should be assimilating to their new country, not trying to improve it by making it like their old country. so instead, western societies should have strict immigration laws, fewer immigrants coming in, stricter laws about assimilation, and so on.
 The Republicans are Philosophically Bankrupt, and are Causing the Collapse of American Democracy (Which was Flawed in the First Place)	so here s my view: the republican party is philosophically bankrupt, and are causing the collapse of american democracy which kind of sucked to begin with to give you a frame of reference of where i m coming from in this argument, i was raised in a centrist household, and heard a lot of political talk in my household get boiled down to the classic both sides do bad things argument, which i, up until a short while ago, took in stride this is something i still believe, but to make the leap and say that both sides are equal is frankly absurd and anyone that believes that really needs to look into the differences between the two parties actions the faustian bargain republicans are philosophically bankrupt, and the fact that people need to be convinced that that s the case is actually strange ever since the republican party s southern strategy in the election of 1964, they have been courting white racists in a bid to build a coalition to rival the democratic one the republicans cleverly tried to repackage anti desegregationism as states rights in order to tow in centre to centre right voters, so as not to appear as the actually racist party this was a faustian bargain that has finally caught up to republicans over half a century later, but it s making our entire country pay for it . the far right exists, since the 1960s, only inside the republican base the far right on their own weren t large enough to make a large coalition in congress, and the republicans couldn t win, at least initially without racists either outright or closeted , and so their alliance was built out of necessity, along with christian conservatives, neo mccarthyists, neocons, libertarians, and corporate interests i m not necessarily saying all those groups are bad, but what has happened is that all those groups have bled into one another the segregationists managed to repackage themselves as traditional values supporters, things which appealed to christian conservatives their militant white nationalist beliefs shifted to being militant about other stuff, like thinking that democrats were socialists and this bled into the modern neocon and neo mccarthyist crowds and in the case of some libertarians, their packaging of states rights spoke directly to supposed small government supporters there has been a slow takeover of a lot of the republican base as the original white supremacists co opted the language of other groups i m not saying every republican elected has been one where a bunch of groups were all puppeted by white supremacists do i think that the bushes or reagan were specifically banking on white supremacy no, not remotely but they did benefit off that faustian bargain, even if they were unknowing about it and this co opting of other political groups language has ensnared a lot of centrists too, who support a lot of really shitty candidates because they think about the economy ! and it s that initial grab of others language that slowly exposes the initially centre to centre right people to the community of farther right people, and eventually, blends the lines between their views this has been greatly accelerated by the advent of the internet . when someone is looking up a political topic video and then are immediately shown a prager u or ben shapiro ad, they are predisposed to looking into that view and the left, usually doesn t do this anywhere near as much as the far right i myself almost fell down the rabbit hole of being an anti sjw free speech advocate, even as i still held the guise of being centre. i know this is true for a lot of other people, because it happened to myself and frankly, the 2016 and even 2018 elections prove that where americans think the political centre is, is actually a lot farther right in some cases than they d like to believe, because in the minds of those centrists they re not conservative, they re just pro free speech, and anti leftist censorship again, co optation of language then you take into account facebook, where we most often are friends with people in our area, and you get conservative areas spiraling into the far right because they can see a vaguely nazist viewpoint repackaged into neutral language, and then without anyone to explicitly say, that sounds kinda racist , they think it s actually normal and so they might share a similar view, or look at some altright talking point video on youtube and then youtube recommends them another one, and another one and oh look, a spiral into nazism we go it s citizen made propaganda and the republicans aren t explicitly to blame for centrists and conservative unknowingly descending into white supremacy, but they did enable that behavior in the first place, and still capitalize off of it happening liberal areas don t have this nearly to the extent of the faux conservatives, and honestly even when they do, it s usually aimed for justice, and being more conscious of societal discrimination, or combatting fascist views of the far right hell, going back to the point on co opting language, just look at what authoritarians have done to the word justice. justice in the practice of governance is usually equated to a couple things, namely equal treatment of individuals often taken in modern contexts to specifically focus on crime , or doing that which is right authoritarians have essentially co opted what justice means for the left when they talk about justice they talk in the framework of justice being a sort of product of liberal social justice warriors to limit free speech . the term sjw is a pejorative term for authoritarians, true conservatives, centrists, and even some one the left back to the point of areas becoming more radicalized, it s been proven that the right has become more radicalized faster than the left right wingers have killed 10 times as many people in terrorist attacks than the left wing. term . bc70a3786224 that statistic comes from a conservative think tank we can even look at the average ideology of congress images housenew. png and you can see that overall, the republican party has radicalized much faster in congress than the democrats deal with the devil, but we pay for it philosophical bankruptcy is a term i don t use lightly, but it s also one i have to define in this case to me, philosophical bankruptcy is essentially ignoring the fundamental enlightenment esque values that our government was built on basically, the idea for our government is that we should firstly, be able to elect a body of representatives that will accurately reflect our societal views, and assure we have a voice in government even if your views are stupid and monstrous, you have a right to have a voice in government if there are enough of you secondly is that we have checks and balances on the political system, and thirdly is that each branch of government should try to find relative common ground to work for most people a roundabout way of saying the government should compromise and work for justice and it shouldn t surprise you that i m going to say that republicans, have not abided by this at all in recent years . over the years, republicans obstructed 71 court nominations, including failing to even hold a vote for merrick garland s supreme court seat republicans blocked health care for 9 11 responders republicans refused support for intervention in the syrian civil war, even after chemical weapons had been used, but conveniently changed their tune once trump took the reins republicans filibustered many bipartisan bills too part of john boehner s and mcconnell s scorched earth approach to never compromise such as student loan affordability, paycheck fairness act, small business tax crs, political finance disclosure disclose , closing loopholes for tax evasion, and incentives for bringing jobs back home so that part of common ground is thrown out of the window and despite this republicans still manage to blame democrats for being obstructionist, even when they re in the minority in the senate and house . and guess what it works virtually everyone in the republican coalition does not care, or genuinely believes that democrats are the real problem in politics this coincides a lot with the anti intellectualism part of republican doctrine they don t care about the overwhelming evidence of climate change they don t care about the fact that immigration is one of the strongest parts of the us economy they don t care about trump decrying all news against him as fake news in fact they don t care about evidence much in general kavanaugh s hearing was depicted on the right as a leftist witch hunt they flat out refuse to protect the investigation of robert mueller, which should honestly be kind of a no brainer just let the man finish his job! they warp and deny reality, and feed into the emotion of irrational bigots who are their audience then you have republicans actively subverting the will of the people and trying to take away power from minorities in the country republicans routinely try to make it harder for people of color to vote under the guise of a threat that doesn t exist but the president continues to perpetuate as the reason he lost the popular vote the whole voter fraud scandal they have tried everything in their power to keep people away from the voting booths and when the vote happens and it s a close race, and an automatic recount is called for, they try and deny it from happening and they tamper with elections even more by actively committing voter fraud and even when they lose, they gerrymandered the country so hard back in 2010 that they still win substantially with less than half the vote . democrats in wisconsin won 53 of the vote, but 36 of seats ohio republicans won 52 of the vote, but 75 of seats north carolina republicans carried 50 of the vote, but 77 of the seats and in texas it was 50 of votes for the republicans, and 64 of seats democrats did this in some states too, which is still extremely bad, but nowhere near the size and scale of the republicans republicans also stole 7 us house seats in the last election. and in wisconsin and in michigan, even when gerrymandering is already prevalent, and republicans lost their respective gubernatorial races, republicans have voted to strip executive powers of the governors and attorney generals. that s nothing short of a power grab that s only legal because there s technically nothing against it . and there s a whole saying for how democrats are supposed to respond they go low, we go high but again, the responsibility of being compromising, rational, and intellectual is left to the party doing far less of the real and lasting damage to our democracy and even when democrats act compromising, they are called obstructionist even when they act rational, they get called unsustainable or idealistic and even when they are intellectual, they get called out on promoting the liberal agenda which i want to point out, no shit that s literally their job, it just so happens that the majority of the liberal agenda is either focused on egalitarianism or science and whenever things go sideways for republicans they claim it either didn t happen or say that whatever it was, wasn t a big deal this has been the case for the last 3 years american democracy was already flawed, republicans just exploited it so the third part of my opinion is that american democracy kind of already sucked, and republicans have just ruthlessly exploited the shortcomings of the founding fathers, and the democrats have been too complacent with the current system they should practically be calling for revolution at this point, but so the slow boil goes the system is super flawed the electoral college is broken and has ruined 50 of the last 4 elections it uses plurality for voting for one thing, which discourages people from voting for whatever candidate they actually want also the popular vote is really more of a suggestion than a guarantee of winning even if you win both the electoral college and popular vote, you can still get your win revoked when the college meets the senate is really stupid really smart for its time, but at the moment really stupid it was made so that geographically diverse areas would stay in the union and have a voice well, we ve kind of solved any secession disputes at this point, and splitting the country up based on geography would be near impossible without cutting corners it gives small states way too much power which literally makes their votes worth far more than those of big states it should really be abolished, since there s not a huge point for it anymore instead double the amount of house representatives, because the current apportionment of people per representative is appalling the current apportionment is per 700,000 people and is also susceptible to gerrymandering, neither or which were an intended feature it started at one rep per 60,000 people doubling it would bring it down to 350,000 maybe we could triple the house size and bring it to 230,000 this problem only gets larger the longer we wait all legislatures should use member based proportional systems. this would also give third parties their actual number of votes they got in the election also there should be a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united, because it s a frankly absurdly undemocratic decision, that also consistently throws elections to whoever can outspend the other person anyways, that was kind of a collection of multiple views, but i hope i gave enough of an indepth explanation
 Trans people aren't the gender they identify with	whenever trans or genderfluid people are referred to as whatever they identify as, it kinda annoys me. i consider myself a scientifically minded person, i do not believe in souls and to me everyone is the sex they were born with and nothing else. the concept of gender as i understand it a collection of certain traits and behaviours that are considered typical for a certain sex is a social construct i strongly dislike and, in my opinion, it is nonsensical to refer to oneself as female, male or whatever else in this sense. if a guy likes wearing dresses or a girl wants to act manly, those are their personal preferences and facets of their personality, but that does do not make them something other than their biological sex in any way. they are not 'actually the opposite sex' just because they don't like or adhere to the traditional image of their sex that was given to them by society. i also see body dysmorphia as an acquired mental illness and not as something trans people deal with because of some kind of inherent dissonance between their mind and body. in my opinion, they develop this issue as a result of the experiences they make in life. they weren't born to have these problems, society is at fault. is there some kind of thing i'm misunderstanding or missing here? i don't like getting negative feelings whenever i come across trans positivity and i would really like to change my view if another view is more logical .
 The Reaction to the "Native Leader" vs. MAGA Catholic Kids Event Is Wrong, Bolsters "Fake News" Claim	tl;dr; the original video was misleading due to framing and omission of context. the reaction was extreme and risks hurting children. given the additional context that contradicts the original narrative, many individuals chose to double down on their original claims and demands. the entire situation actually supports the maga 'fake news' narrative that otherwise, is entirely false. this gives them concrete evidence to back up that claim in the future. first off: i'm just some guy following the story whose tired of following it. i've got nothing to do with it. i'm not a native american. i'm not a black hebrew israelite. i'm not a catholic. i'm an atheist. i'm registered independent, and i voted for clinton. i can't stand the maga agenda. i think trump has done irreparable damage both to america and to america's social fabric. i'd throw a party if impeachment proceedings started today. but facts are facts, wrong is wrong, and harming a child and a child's future because they represent something that makes you angry is wrong. for the sake of completeness: the original 3:44 minute clip that started the outrage continue 109 amp;v sig5zb0fw1k continue 109 amp;v sig5zb0fw1k . the extended 1:46:18 clip showing everything that transpired with better context the immediate claims about the first video were that the catholic maga hat wearing student group were mocking nathan phillips, the native american protest leader, and his group. evidence of this put forth as the look on the children's faces, and that they were chanting 'build the wall. ' none of the videos have actually captured evidence of the chant. it doesn't mean it didn't happen, but there is no video evidence for it. when phillips showed up some of the students chanted with them. some made 'tomahawk' gestures. that's probably insensitive. but it does not make them racist, or the face of the patriarchy. the full video shows that the entire event began with a group of black hebrew israelite street preachers being basically horrible to everyone that had the misfortune to be within earshot. this includes individuals from the native american protest group. it includes children from the catholic group. they called the students crackers, peckerwoods, 'dusty ass animals' and 'future school shooters. ' they call black individuals 'uncle toms' and 'uncle coon' and 'uncle tomahawks. ' in the face of the taunting from the bhi group, some of the students can be heard defending students that represent minorities including the black student, and a student called a faggot by the bhi group. nathan phillips has stated that he saw a look of mob mentality in the faces of the young catholics, and that he put himself between predator the boys and their prey the black hebrew israelites . phillips very well might have de escalated a potentially violent situation but his assumptions about who was actually making the situation tense were clearly wrong. as one of the black hebrew israelites points out 'we're surrounded and they won't do a damn thing. ' that's correct. the students stood around chanting school chants and acting like silly kids. 'they didn't do a damn thing,' in spite of being mad dogged by these angry, offensive street preachers. the three minute clip showing a young man in a maga hat with a cheeky grin being in phillip's face was, as bari weiss stated in a conversation with joe rogan a rorschach test, in which all of america saw what they wanted to see. given the additional context, we can see that phillips put himself directly in front of that student. the student did not choose to be there. when i saw the three minute clip i was outraged like many others. i saw a white maga hated kid nose to nose with an old native american man and i let all my assumptions guide me. but given the full context, its obvious those assumptions, in this situation, were incorrect. some media outlets have tried to correct the narrative. others have not. others have continued to call these students 'the face of white patriarchy. ' essentially, these students since this started, numerous individuals, both famous and anonymous, have demanded the children be doxed. they've demanded they be expelled. they've demanded that this situation prevent them from ever attending a college. essentially, these children represent systemic oppression and for that, they need to pay. the students have been both successfully and unsuccessfully doxed. the students' families have received death threats. another child that was misidentified and was not at the event was doxed and received similar threats. this is wrong. i won't argue that covington catholic, and the catholic church, in general, doesn't have a great track record on treating minorities, woman, and the lgbtq community as equals, and with respect. but that's an awful lot of weight to put on the shoulders of these children. and i keep repeating the word children because i don't want you to forget: we're talking about children . in spite of the fac that the video record the only one that really matters imo , doesn't show them behaving particularly badly, there have been calls to ruin their futures. why would you want to prevent these students from getting a college education? that's the place where they are most likely to learn a different, more tolerant, worldview. finally, this event provides concrete evidence of actual fake news. every time donald trump, r t d, and other maga folks call a story that calls our trump's lying and unethical behavior, they can fall back on the curious case of the covington catholics kids as evidence. in fact, he already has src twsrc 5etfw 7ctwcamp 5etweetembed 7ctwterm 5e1087689415814795264 amp;ref url https 3a 2f 2fwww. cnn. com 2f2019 2f01 2f22 2fpolitics 2fdonald trump covington students 2findex. html src twsrc 5etfw 7ctwcamp 5etweetembed 7ctwterm 5e1087689415814795264 amp;ref url https 3a 2f 2fwww. cnn. com 2f2019 2f01 2f22 2fpol itics 2fdonald
 Victims of repeated domestic (emotional and physical) abuse shouldn't be blamed for the actions of their abusers, but should be held accountable for putting themselves in positions where it can happen. Particularly when theyâ€™ve been educated about whatâ€™s happening.	trigger warning doesn't seem to be a trigger warning flair i realise this wrong and unhelpful opinion i genuinely want to change it within myself. i'm reading a book called 'helping her get free' and it's challenging my views, but i'm not finding it compelling in the reasoning behind statements such as don't be judgemental of, and don't advise victims of abuse. how can you not judge someone who repeatedly makes objectively poor decisions that affect themselves and often those around them. specifically people who stay with or go back to partners who emotionally or physically abuse them . in any other circumstances you would hold people accountable for making bad decisions. why are the victims of domestic abuse different? if people don't practice basic hygiene factors in their relationships, why do they get a pass from judgement. is it because the consequences of being in the relationship are bad enough? the relationship they re choosing to prolong? i think allowing yourself to be the victim of abuse is a sign of poor judgement and emotional immaturity. i realise allowing yourself to be the victim might be a problematic statement, please help me understand why. if there s a dog in your house and it bites you get rid of the dog, whether you love it or not. if this is simplistic someone please tell me why. for me there s a difference between ignorance and immaturity. if you simply aren t aware of the dynamics of what s going on then you have my sympathy. but if someone pulls back the veil and you have enough information but not the wherewithal to act on it you don t. it's particularly annoying when this then has negative knock on impacts on their friends and loved ones. arguments i don t find compelling right now and my reason why not : it s dangerous to leave an abuser , most murders happen to ex partners not current, once the abuser realises their control is waning i simply don t recognise this as a reason not to leave you should still leave, just take precautions when you do. the longer you stay the worse it will be eventually, all the research states this. also i m not talking about people who are in imminent physical danger here, clearly that's a different situation abusers manipulate their victim s very psychology i think you have responsibility for your own psychology and if someone provides you with information on what s going on you should be open minded enough to consider it you should be mature enough to withstand. most victims aren't aware of what's going on i am very specifically talking about victims who have been educated about the dynamics of their situation and go back anyway . it doesn t help victims to feel this way , and they already have enough to deal with this is the closest to compelling for me, but doesn t get there. being accountable for your own actions isn t just about helping you, it s about recognising that what you do might endanger and make you miserable, but it can also do the same to those around you your view lacks humanity and or compassion this is why i m here, but it s sadly it s just not enough on its own to change my view. i don t think this says something good about the person i am right now, but there it is i realise my view right now lacks compassion. i sincerely hope i look back on this post in a short while and am thoroughly ashamed of these views. i m battling them at the moment and really hope someone can change my view. thanks
 PC culture is ruining society.	let s turn back the clock to 11 years ago. we did not have discussions about if it is okay for a man with a penis who identifies as a woman to use the restroom with little girls or use the locker room with grown women. we did not have prominent celebrities being woke and talking about how evil white men are and how we need to expand lgbt rights. we didn t have left wing political messages being inserted into children shows like arthur. in fact, even barack obama believed that marriage should be between a man and a woman. today in 2019, if you believe what people believed 11 years ago, you get called out on social media, bullied until you re off the platform and shunned by a large section of society because you do not agree with their socially progressive views. commonly you re told well this is a different time! it s 2019 and things are changing so you better conform you bigot! i think it s perfectly acceptable for others to be as socially progressive as they want but i think it s unfair for those people to force their beliefs on others or censor those or shame those that they don t agree with. in my opinion, forcing your socially progressive views on conservatives is just as bad as a fundamentalist christian preacher to force his religious views on non christians.
 Prostitution is not just like 'any other job.'	i reject the argument that prostitution is just like any other job through the following reasonings. there is something intrinsically special about sexual intercourse. this intrinsic feature sets the act of selling sex as distinct from other sorts of labour. such as, flipping hamburgers or working in construction. to see why this is the case, consider that clearly someone being forced to sell sex is far worse than someone being forced to work in any other job like construction or accounting. additionally, someone working to be a prostitute out of desperation is far worse than someone working in a fast food restaurant out of desperation. furthermore, assume the premise that it is wrong for a seller or merchant to refuse to sell to potential customers for discriminatory reasons. to put it simply, it is morally wrong for a restaurant owner to refuse, on a racist basis, service to minorities. then consider that this same moral principle is not applicable to prostitution. a prostitute should be allowed, because it is moral, to refuse service to whomever she feels so inclined, even if the refusal is based on discriminatory grounds. for example, a prostitute should be allowed to refuse service to minorities if she does not want to sell herself to them, or she should be allowed to refuse service to people she does not deem attractive enough by her standards.
 Accusations that Disney movie villains used to be "queer-coded" are bullshit. Queer people are being over-eager to claim that every portrayal of a non-traditionally masculine/feminine person is a portrayal of them. If anything, Disney movies are class-coded against the privileged.	this came to my attention because of all the legit complaints that the scar in the new lion king is boring. weirdly, though, they say it's because he's no longer gay coded, which on doing some googling turns out to be a ludicrously popular belief. where's the evidence for him being gay? he's physically emotive shows his feelings through body language a lot , and once, he waves something off with a pronounced limp wrist. that doesn't necessarily mean gay, that can also be intended as a portrayal of an aristocratic snob, which is what i always thought he was meant to be backed up by the fact that jeremy irons, a straight man, plays him with a pompous high class english accent. really, the 'coding' in lion king is class coding: upper class people are the target. mufasa is the warm, paternal, american accented james earl jones. why do you think they chose a british man to voice his brother? because british people with posh accents evoke the specter of privilege and arrogance, and that's the real target, not gay people. basically, there's a difference between effete 'affected, overrefined, and ineffectual' and effeminate, and lgbt advocates tend to ignore that when trying to make their point. disney tends to shit on effete characters, as you'll see, along with toxic masculinity, as often represented by hunters. i'll give you ursula, no question about it: she was explicitly based on divine, a popular drag queen, but one example isn't a trend, and after ursula the evidence gets pretty fragile but quite strong for 'class privilege coding'. here all the movies before 2000: snow white: the jealous queen is a villainous aristocrat, literally, with a posh accent. very traditionally feminine. pinocchio: the closest thing to a villain is stromboli a racist gypsy caricature, arguably, but not queer coded. bambi: hunters are the villains. traditionally masculine, if you're going to try to characterize who disney was aiming at. dumbo: never seen it. cinderella : the evil stepmother was 'lady' tremaine, a villainous aristocrat who tried to artificially limit our heroine's ascent in society to benefit her own less worthy daughters. that's a theme still relevant today. alice in wonderland : the queen of hearts, a villainous aristocrat who rules tyrannically and homicidally. peter pan: captain hook, a villainous aristocrat. dressed like a wealthy british dandy, high class british accent. lady and the tramp: snobby siamese cats who are super racist caricatures. i'd say 'neutral' for the purpose of this discussion, although you could argue they're meant to portray spoiled, privileged scions of a rich family emphasized by the movie's general theme of promoting inter class marriage. sleeping beauty: the evil fairy maleficent, a villainous aristocrat. posh accent, iconic 'royal' accoutrements like a big jewel on her finger. is referred to as 'your excellency', refers to the good fairies as 'the rabble'. not relevant, but i have to add she's kinda hot. 101 dalmatians: cruella de vil, a villainous aristocrat: wears fur, posh accent, big jewels, the whole nine yards: a send up of the selfish, callous wealthy. sword and the stone: if there's anyone more straight than sir ector and his dunderheaded son kay, strike me dead. you can't exactly call them villainous, but they're certainly the antagonists, and once again privileged as hell. madame mim is a wicked witch arguably an anti feminist trope, but neither here nor there. the jungle book: shere khan, a villainous aristocrat with a posh british accent, the dignified and hyper masculine 'king' of the jungle. aristocats: never actually seen it, but based on the wikipedia summary, this one goes against my point: the villain is the butler, plotting against the wise and generous mistress of the house. doesn't appear to be queer coded either, though. robin hood: prince john, literally a villainous aristocrat. unmanly, but that's not the same as effeminate. the rescuers: madame medusa. this is a tough one. posh accent, nice car, and dressed in high style, and hyper feminine in a way that's kind of creepy. whether the garishness of the makeup suggests to you queer coding via reference to drag or a take on villainous feminine sexuality is debatable. the fox and the hound: amos slade is part of disney's tradition of masculine villains. if they're not aristocratic, they're hunters. bambi started it, this continues it, and it keeps cropping up. not remotely queer coded. the great mouse detective: ratigan is a villainous aristocrat whose identity is so tied up in his aristocracy that the thing that sets him off most is a reminder that he's actually a sewer rat. hyper masculine big bulging muscles, etc. oliver and company: sykes drives a big, expensive black car, owns pedigreed attack dogs, smokes cigars yeah, that's a villainous aristocrat. the little mermaid: conceded. rescuers down under: percival c. mcleach is a hyper masculine poacher. beauty and the beast: sing it with me: no one's straight like gaston, privileged as gaston, no one predicted the rise of metoo like gaston, he's the peak of critique of the patriarchy and not the least bit queer coded at all. aladdin: jafar wears guyliner, it's undeniable. but he's also part of what you all may now be recognizing as a lineage of high class villains. posh accent, elegant demeanour, extravagant facial hair gay men can be those things, yes, but they're also caricatures of the rich. also, i don't know queer coded you can be as a character if you end the movie by turning jasmine into your bdsm slave pet. the lion king: see start of post. pocahontas: governor ratcliffe has ribbons in his hair! that's queer coding! no, that's class coding: ratcliffe is a villainous aristocrat who doesn't have to, and in fact actively avoids, real work, which is symbolized by his fancy manner of dressing: in an ostentatious manner that nobody who sweats for a living possibly would. the other familiar markers are present, too: posh british accent, extravagant facial hair, references to the good guys as 'witless peasants'. ribbons gay is underthinking it. the hunchback of notre dame: judge frollo is a villainous aristocrat who lusts after the heroine. hercules: this is one of those that astonishes me. queer coded, really? he's more like a used car salesman, and i think that's deliberate: always fast talking people into contracts that screw them over. this is one of the reaches on the 'queer code' list. he's meant to be unmanly, yes, but not in ways that are gay. mulan: shan yu is a hypermasculine warlord with bulging muscles and a bitching pencil moustache who's trying to conquer china. tarzan: fittingly, the final villain on our list brings it all together: a hypermasculine, aristocratic hunter with a posh british accent oh, and the classically villainous pencil moustache. so there it is, 28 movies from ww2 to 2000. of those 28 movies with a villain who's some combination of an aristocrat, a hunter, or hypermasculine: 21 not counting madame medusa, hades, or the siamese cats . movies where the villain is queer coded: 1, plus another 2 3 where it's arguable either way. queer people have plenty to complain about in terms of historical depictions in film, but 'queer coding' in disney movies isn't one of those things.
 the recent incident where a 15 year old was pepper sprayed and arrested was justified.	the video in question i got into multiple discussions about that video post that has been gilded. for starters the video starts right after a fight was broken up and atleast 1 was arrested laying on the ground out of frame at the beggining. a big point to build context is that a hundred or two hundred bystanders surrounded the 3 or so officers trying to deal with the situation. from my understanding the kid in red that was forced to the ground tried to grab a phone that was dropped by the guy already arrested laying on the ground. this is illegal. and was a crime scene by my understanding by that point. from that point he was going to be arrested, the officer told the kid in red to back off. the kid was then pepper sprayed and then brought to the ground to be arrested. the majority of people commenting on the thread said the cop was excessive in force but i feel it was justified considering the situation. the officers had to protect themselves while a mob had formed around them and some bystanders were already moving onto the crime scene. mob mentality is very unpredictable and no matter the training, you cant predict how it will play out. the fact that the kid in red got right in the officers space and reached for evidence on the ground, was grounds for him being arrested being it was a crime scene. the actions by the arresting officer that gave a single punch showed just enough restraint that he didnt go overboard but it was definitely very aggressive to the untrained eye. here is the description i could find of the report of the incident in the affidavit, krickovich said that he and his partner sgt. greg lacerra responded to a call from a mcdonald s in tamarac, fl, at 3 p. m. on thursday after employees reported a large group of teenagers gathering for a fight outside the restaurant. he wrote that the mcdonald's was a popular after school gathering place for students from a nearby high school and the scene of frequent fights including an incident the day before that had caused damage to a bystander's car. krickovich and lacerra arrived after the fight had ended, per the affidavit, but as they ordered the crowd of teens to disperse, they identified one of the perpetrators from wednesday's fight who had been warned not to trespass in the area again and took him into custody. while i was dealing with the male on the ground, i observed his phone slide to the right of me and then behind me. i observed a teen wearing a red tank top reach down and attempt to grab the male student s phone, krickovich wrote. when lacerra ordered the other boy to stay back, he said, the teenager took an aggressive stance toward the officer and bladed his body and began clenching his fists. lacerra pepper sprayed the teen in the face and forced him to the ground, krickovich wrote. there were more than 200 students in the crowd, according to krickovich, and this is when many of them started recording the incident on their phones. per the affidavit, the officers feared for their safety and worked to restrain the teenager on the ground in an attempt to de escalate the situation. krickovich said that he hit the 15 year old with a closed fist on the right side of his head as 'a distractionary technique' to get the teen to release his right hand from under his head. 'this technique was successful and i was able to place him into handcuffs without further incident. '
 Trump supporters should not enjoy the privilege that they deny others. We should be harassing them for their beliefs, based on how they harass others for the color of their skin, their identity, their orientation, or their genitals.	every day, people are harassed for no good reason. a black man, walking down the street, is called 'n ' by people driving past him. he continues walking, it hurts but not as much as the first several times. a trump supporter walks down the street. no one can tell what's in their mind. maybe if this person is a minority, they'll be harassed. but they are more likely to be white than not, and more likely to be male than not. so, they are less likely to be harassed than your average citizen. bottom line, i think trump supporters are either misinformed, ignorant, or selfish people. we can't fight back against fox news and the very powerful influence that 24 hour news has on the modern discourse. we can't help selfish people at all. so, they need to learn to stop hating. we need offensive words for trump supporters, such as 'trump supporters. ' trump supporters should be harassed in the streets, should be harassed on reddit they do not deserve a safe place since they destroy safe places for others. please note yes, i am angry. i am incredibly angry, and upset. politics is not a game! millions of peoples lives are affected every day. despite this, despite years of this, we still have a majority of america comfortable to lives their lives wrapped up in privilege, and i think many of those people would change their minds if they were subject to the same effects that they push on others. i'm upset that i'm so militant about it. i've lost the ability to have compassion for trump supporters. i honestly believe they're all complicit at this point. it's depressing, and exhausting. it's bad for me and those around me. i don't actually want to harass people. i just want them to stop harassing others, and i don't know how to accomplish any of that.
 The heavy focus on the idea of a "covert racist" is a waste of time at best, a malicious distraction at worst.	i believe that we're spending too much time trying to figure out which of our politicians are and are not racist. the focus has been taken away from things that politicians have said or done that are outwardly racist alarming soundbite, blackface in old halloween costumes, things like that and towards more ethereal sources. today, a politician can be accused of being racist because of the company he choose to associate with. the idea of 'covert racist' being pushed around, the implication being that many politicians are racist but work very hard to avoid 'outing' themselves. i'm not here to argue that there is no such thing as a covert racist. in fact, i'm very sure that there is such a thing. what i do want to argue are two points. 1 it's unfair to accuse someone of being a covert racist before taking the time to truly try to understand their logic behind supporting a policy. there is a growing divide between the left and the right, and i have a very serious concern that the idea of the 'covert racist' teaches those on the left that they can't possibly understand the logic of someone who supports strong immigration laws or opposes affirmative action, because those policies 'only come from people who are secretly racist'. now more than ever we need to engage in healthy dialog and seek common ground. 2 if their policies are good, their intentions simply shouldn't matter. if a 'covert racist' is so good at hiding his racism that his policies are good for minorities, then i really don't care about his personal beliefs. by the same logic, if a well intentioned politician who cares greatly about minorities creates a policy that hurts them, he's got to go. intention doesn't matter, results matter. rather than arguing all day about whether or not a politician is secretly racist, start having a conversation about his policies and what you think of them. in my experience, it's much more difficult to go against the grain here. i've been accused myself of being a racist just for disagreeing with this new logic. so please, convince me why i should jump on the bandwagon.
 Capitalism is the best economic system and is responsible for most of our modern prosperity	why do a lot of people say that the economic system where you only get paid if you produce goods or services that people, companies and other consumers buy out of their free will is morally wrong? even if this produces inequality the capitalist system forces people if they want to get paid to produce goods and services that consumers want. some people have better opportunities to do this of course, however i still don't see why the system where how much money you make is normally determined by how much value you add to consumers is the wrong system and why we should switch to socialism instead were things aren't determined by what the market consumers want. capitalism is the only system that i've seen that creates the best incentives to innovate and it forces producers to make goods and services more appealing to the consumers every year. i'm afraid of the rhetoric on reddit that people want to destroy a lot of the incentives that are apart of capitalism and that if we change the system we will stagnate technologically or even regress.
 in modern day, Christianity is the most washed-up, baseless religion, with perhaps no true followers but the Orthodox and Catholics.	to start off, i am anti theist, i was born and raised christian, but now identify as atheist. i will listen but cannot promise anyone will change my view. my claim is basically this: there are so many iterations and beliefs of the certain christian sects, that many of them no longer resemble true christianity. for instance, there are certain passages in the bible that are homophobic, yet many christians choose to not believe gay people are sinners and others believe you can t be a gay christian . there are thousands of examples like these. another example is in timothy where one of the passages says women should not be allowed to speak over men. is that upheld in many denominations today? no. how can you claim to be christian, if you literally pick and choose what you believe is true from the bible? i wish to turn a blind eye to what i think is morally wrong from the bible, and morph it into what i believe it should be. then you are actively choosing what you think is true. you have essentially created your own religion from a book that ranges from jehovah s witnesses to presbyterianism. from flds fundamental latter day saints ro seventh day adventists. it is all so hypocritical and i can t stand it. i cannot stand that you could read from a book and ignore almost everything bad in it yet choose to be homophobic. just read leviticus or deuteronomy and you will see what a twisted religion it really is. people ignore everything completed bizarre and twisted in it because they love jesus. recently i watched a youtube video of a christian couple. one of them had a tattoo, yet was talking about gay people straying from god. yet all sins are equal under god, supposedly. i am also not a fan of how seemingly ignorant christian people are. it is written in scripture that if the entire world is converted to christianity, jesus will reign down for 1,000 years in the millennium isaiah 11:6 9, revelation 20:4 . how many christians actively ignore that? or don t ignore that, and think they have a personal responsibility to save you? missionary work is still a product of imperialism and it makes me sick. one of my close friends went to africa and did nothing but talk to them about jesus. why don t you give them toilets or running water or clean water or something actually useful? ? ? i have many christian friends. but sometimes, i wish they would just shut up.
 Muslims do not worship the same God as Christians and Jews	i saw a post earlier on that argues that muslims and christians shouldn't be arguing as much as they are now since they share many things in common and are not as different as they think. one of his main points is that we worship the same god. first of all, i think this is simply untrue if you simply compare the two beliefs. 1. god's name and title: when we christians refer to god, we simply refer him as god as if it were a title like our lord or our saviour. this is a practice from judaism as the jews did not refer to god by his name too. according to the old testament and the torah, god's name was yhwh yahweh but the jews refused to call him by his name, preferring to call him adonai instead meaning 'our lord'. when it comes to muslims, they refer to god as allah. contrary to what many people think, allah is not the word for 'god' rather it is his name. this can be seen in the shahada, the first pillar of islam: there is no god but god l il ha ill ll h as you can see, there is a difference the word for god as in 'deity' is ilah and the 'name' given to god is allah. because saying there is no god but god doesn't really make sense does it? if you remember from judaism teachings, yahweh is supposedly the name for god but they do not refer to him by his name rather by his title. same with us christians, we refer to him by his title 'god' rather than his name. 2. difference in moral code: we christians and jews have a moral code it is our fundaments of worship and ethics known as the ten commandments. but it is completely absent in the qu'ran and muslims instead adhere to different morals given by allah throughout the qu'ran. one thing to note is that christian and jewish beliefs come from divine inspiration which means that god did not directly give the ten commandments rather by mose's inspiration from god while the qu'ran is considered to be the direct word of allah through muhammad. 3. origins of the kaaba most sacred site in islam : so you claim the 3 to be abrahamic religions despite clear differences between christianity and judaism vs. islam. there is another difference i think that invalidates islam to be called an abrahamic religion. the story goes that the kaaba was built by abraham who was ordered by allah to build it to be used by pagans to host their idols and make pagan gatherings. if christians and muslims believe in the same god jews too , then how come the kaaba is not even mentioned in both the bible and the torah. after all it is supposedly abraham himself who built it by order of allah. it is also worthy to note that the biblical stories of christianity and judaism both originate and take place in the land of modern day israel, far far away from mecca where the kaaba resides. instead the bible had the taberbacle which was the earthly dwelling place of god, something never mentioned in islam. conclusion: i don't have a problem with people making more peace together or to understand each other. i do not hold any comtempt for muslims as i do not hold any comtempt for people, rather it is the ideology of islam i openly criticise. i do not agree with its views against non muslims, women, homosexuals, apostates, freedom of speech or rights and responsibilities. people like to use the argument of 'muslims and christians both worship the same god so why can't you get along with each other? ' to disregard people's arguments and criticism against islam. again, my criticism is against islam, not against its worshippers. i think i have presented enough material to refute the argument that muslims believe in the same god as christians and jews. feel free to comment your thoughts and opinions on this.
 Many mods are socially inept.	in my own experience specifically excluding this sub, i have no experience with the mods here mods tend to be extremely unfavorable towards non native speakers. rules for subs tend to be strictly written but broadly enforced, and requests for information tend to be shut down with 'you should read the rules'. of course, it makes sense, as a mod position is a position of anonymous power and thus likely abused. it tends to target individuals with very partisan opinions otherwise, why mod for that specific sub , those with too much time and too little to do. now, this doesn't make one socially inept per se, of course. nevertheless the trend i experienced is that mods tend to take very little time and consideration on their replies and tend to assume the worst in their conversation partners. a reply with 'have a good day' or ' i don't understand' tends to be brushed off with the threat of a ban. these are signs of an individual abusing their power, and signs of individuals not having learned that the carrot is better than the stick. as such, my experience is that mods are socially less adept than most people. cmv?
 Most advice given to women about staying safe isn't 'victim blaming', it's crime prevention	victim blaming blaming occurs when 'the victim of a crime is held entirely or partially at fault for the harm that befell them'. victim blaming absolutely, 100 happens. and, of course, it primarily happens where the victim is a woman and the crime is sexual assault harassment. i have no doubt that women are disproportionately subject to victim blaming, because there are many sick deluded people mostly men, i'm sure who have a disgraceful view of sex. this should end, and we should call out anyone who targets women in this way. however, i believe the extent to which this is a widespread and or societal problem is overstated. significant amounts of so called 'victim blaming' is well meaning, non sexist, pragmatic crime prevention which individuals and institutions broadcast equally for every other crime. this might be best illustrated by an example. police departments everywhere give advice towards preventing your home from being a target of burglary. lock your doors at night, install alarms, leave the tv on when you go on holiday, install cameras, install a motion activated light, get a dog, put a sign up, advise your neighbours when you're away. none of this invokes responsibility. it's so obvious that a burglar is criminally and morally responsible for a burglary, that it doesn't even need to be said. the police aren't saying that if you don't lock your doors at night you're responsible for someone coming in and taking your tv. they're saying that burglars unfortunately exist, and they look for empty houses, so leaving a light on will make your house less of a target. and the thing is, everyone understands the rationale behind burglary psas. we don't respond by saying 'stop burglars burglarising, don't blame me for being burgled! i have the right to leave my door wide open at night! ' we know that the police aren't saying that we don't have the right to leave our house unsecured. we know that the police are trying to stop burglars burglarising, as well as giving advice to the public. we understand that they're giving us advice towards reducing our likelihood of being victims to the criminals who unfortunately exist. why do we neglect this pragmatic reasoning when the crime in question is sexual assault? there's no doubt that a girl walking alone, at 3am, whilst intoxicated, looking beautiful, is more likely to be a victim of sexual assault than the sober girl who gets in a taxi with her friends. i wish so much that we lived in a world where it was equally safe to take both paths. but we know that it isn't, in the same way we know that it's less safe to leave our doors unlocked. so why, exactly, do we conclude that giving women the same crime prevention advice that we give to homeowners is sexist victim blaming? change my view!
 Software piracy is okay.	i'm very anti capitalist and anti corporate, and believe companies are out there to press every penny out of your pockets. that being said, i'm also not communist, because it only works in small scale societies and americans are too individualistic to be communist. software companies like microsoft, adobe, apple, autodesk, and others are very greedy and only speak money. adobe wants you to subscribe to their creative cloud model, autodesk wants you to pay thousands of dollars for maya, and so on. no one in their right mind would pay that kind of money for that software, so piracy here is justified because it's saying fuck you to the unreasonably high prices. plus the companies already have tons of money from them licensing their products in bulk to other companies that use them, a few pirates aren't going to shut the whole company down. plus no one unless if you're image line or adobe is going to go after the small fry copyright violations. and if you pay for the software, it's just saying 'yeah keep being a greedy corporation and abuse your workers and your customers' wallets'. if you pirate it, you say 'yeah you ain't getting money out of me. i'm taking your program because your price is unfair. ' being arrested for taking a piece of software for free is stupid. plus a lot of software doesn't allow you to try learn it before you buy it.
 Journalists should be held penally responsible for what they publish, and so should the journal they write for.	this world is now full of information. literally everyone and everything can publish something online, yet the thing that makes us either believe something or not is the reliability of the source. journalists were once widely trusted and highly regarded but modern journalism, with fake news, clickbaity articles or flat out lies has practically gone down the drain and there seems to be no repercussions, at least where i live, for bullshit journalists writing bullshit articles that can and will damage people's life. given the power they hold, is it only fair that with great power comes great responsibilities. but it seems that this isn't the case as journalists can write whatever they want and the responsibility to verify what they are saying lies on us. what's the point of having newspapers if i have to personally verify what they say? it defies the point of having journalists in the first place. we trust doctors with our own lives because they face bad consequences if they screw up: no one tells us to 'verify what your doctor prescribes and look up online your meds', that would be 100 bullshit and no one would buy it. because doctors are supposed to do their job correctly, and if they don't, people can die, and doctors go to jail ok, exceptions apply but you get my point . yet this doesn't seem the case with journalists, who hold just as much as power. why is that? because it would hurt those in power? maybe, but they still should be held responsible. no journalist should be able to sleep well, knowing nothing will happen, if they publish a bullshit article. write bullshit, get legal bullshit. this was originally a r unpopularopinion thread, fyi. want to see what could be wrong with my idea.
 Capital Punishment Should be Made Legal in All States	capital punishment is not cruel. if someone is willing to murder or rape people, then they should also face that punishment. is it cruel to do something that matches the crime committed by someone else? is it cruel to steal from a thief? amp; x200b; additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that it is discriminatory. just because a certain race is punished with the death penalty more than a different race does not mean that it is a result of racism. essentially, correlation does not imply causation. amp; x200b; it is not uncivilized either. the methods used are relatively painless. amp; x200b; also, many people say that capital punishment is not a deterrent to crime. first of all, it has not been applied enough to determine whether this is the case or not. since there have been so few, no one fears capital punishment. in order to make an accurate determination, it needs to be applied more. amp; x200b; additionally, it saves money. why should a criminal get food, a bed, and a shelter when many people die due to a lack of these things?
 Transgenderism isn't a "delusion" but it is a form of mental weakness, similar to homosexuality	personally i suffer from gender dysphoria so i think about this topic a lot. i don't believe the typical conservative argument that transgenderism is a 'delusion. ' most trans people recognize the objective reality about their chromosomes. they just want the words 'man' and 'woman' and 'she' and 'he' to refer to identified gender rather than biological sex. so that's not delusional, it's just a disagreement about definitions. however, i think that transgenderism is a form of degeneracy. fundamentally, all men have homosexual and transsexual desires. the idea of being sexually submissive and having a female body is inherently attractive. after all, the female body is more aesthetically appealing, so who wouldn't want to have a body like that? men evolved as the warrior gender. our bodies are stronger and more powerful, at the expense of aesthetic appeal. our purpose was to hunt and fight. but in modern civilization where raw strength doesn't matter that much, our purpose is diminishing. and now that we don't feel useful or powerful, we are more tempted to fall to degeneracy. previously being male was a tradeoff higher social status and respect in exchange for a less aesthetic body and a less fulfilling sexual role. but nowadays males are getting the increasingly shorter end of the stick. this is also why the male suicide rate is increasing so dramatically. i think there is also a reasonable argument to be made that the far left is encouraging this gradual decay of men and would love to see more of us turn to homosexuality or transsexualism. they want a docile population that can't rebel. which is why the mainstream media pumps out propaganda supporting cuckoldry and distrust of men. trans and gay people are just individuals who have been particularly affected by that propaganda.
 A simple mandate for business to spend an equal amount of money on salaries to men and women will end gender pay gap.	there is a gap in the earnings of men compared to women source i am not here to discuss the extent of it, whether it is fair or not, or the reasons that might describe it for reasons of non discrimination. those are separate and legitimate discussions. my claim is simple: if the government passes a law that businesses should spend an equal amount of money per person on salaries to men and women, then the earnings gap will go away without any long term damage to the economy. if a company fails to comply to this standard, they will be fined by the amount of money necessary to bring that average to equal for that company, plus an extra fee. the tax money will be paid in terms of compensation to the workers of the gender which is paid below the average. this ensures that the company itself is incentivized to pay equally to all genders. this would not be implemented in one go, so there wouldn't be a freakout day where suddenly cleaners are paid at the same rate as doctors. there will be a transition period of multiple years , during which businesses can adjust their hiring and training practices. some challenges that i've given to myself, and my own responses: what if a company has 10 male lawyers and 10 female cleaners? this only demonstrates that the hiring practices of the company has not been gender inclusive enough. during the transition period, they will be able to hire female lawyers and male cleaners and pay them the appropriate rate so that they wouldn't be fined. what about very small businesses? if they have two employees this doesn't work! correct. there should be a minimum number of employees before this regulation kicks in. there are many employment regulations in the us which only applies to businesses larger than a certain number of people. what about businesses where employees of a certain gender are preferred? imagine strip clubs, barbers or beauty salons if a business believes discrimination on this factor serves a real business purpose, then they should apply for an exemption and the regulation needs to be reasonable with those requests. what if there is a shortage of a certain gender among a profession? say females in tech? the regulation does not say the sum of all salaries paid to men and women at a business must be the same, but only that on average, they should be. so google can have 1000 male and 200 female software engineers, as long as those are paid, on average, the same rate, they are good. what about people who do not identify as male or female? nothing in the regulation makes gender a dichotomy. there can be more than two genders and a similar principle applies.
 "Heterophobia" isn't real.	i've seen lots of people on social media complain about lgbt people oppressing straight people or putting them down or smthng and saying that it is the equivalent of homophobia. this is literally the stupidest thing i've ever heard. first of all, someone on the internet saying that straight people are boring isn't even on the same planet as the systematic oppression of lgbt people. untill straight people can be fired, kicked out of their home, beaten, or killed for their heterosexuality, then those jokes will mean nothing. similarly, people joking about straights will never be the same as straight people making fun of gay people. right now, the largest churches in the world all condemn lgbt people, there are politicians and political groups who's main platform is taking away rights and protections from lgbt people, people protest specifically that we don't deserve rights, conversion therapy is legal in most us states, and the vice potus supports conversion therapy. its not uncommon or unacceptable for people to 'not approve' of the 'homosexual lifestyle' and trans people's preferred bathroom is a matter of public debate. if, knowing all these things, you think that a gay person calling you 'hettie' on twitter is heterophobia, you are the densest idiot on the planet
Warren's 70% tax on 50 million is actually a backdoor to raise taxes on the poor and middle class.	first off, let me start by saying i don't believe we should be giving the government a penny more than is absolutely necessary to perform it's core tasks. that being said, i'm going to suspend that position and argue from a a position that government programs add value and if they are legitimate they deserve to be funded. only 205 people in the us make more than 50 million a year. they average 97. 3 million. at 70 marginal tax over 50 million, that's 6. 787 billion dollars in tax revenue. given the estimated income taxes collected for 2019 is at 3. 422 trillion, this would be about 0. 2 of the total taxes collected. given the position i am arguing from above and a first glace, 7 billion dollars in revenue from those that can afford it would not be a bad thing. here is where things go south. what happens when you tax wealthy people? they restructure there tax liabilities, they keep money off shore, they hire expensive accountants to find every loophole possible, they reduce there own income tax from their business and purchase assets in their businesses name. what happens to governments that get money? they spend it. but they also demand that the next year they can spend it again. they are like crack addicts looking for another fix by the following april. if you let warren or sanders put such an outlandish tax bracket in place, our tiers of government with devour that money on year 1. they will find on year 2 that almost all the money has dried up. wealthy people will do what they are good at, stashing their money. all those new government programs will fight for budget the following year. the fight will not appear so straight forward. our schools and roads and public infrastructure maintenance will once again not receive needed increases, these pet projects will latch on to the budget they have and never let it go. we will again see our educators and infrastructure administrators out pleading for more money from the people. why? because they make the best cases to hand over more money. no one wants to fund a pet project to study ant colonies half a world a way. but when faced with short falls in education people want to help. over the course of 3 to 5 years their will be budget shortfalls that have to be plugged with additional taxes on tax brackets that can reliably delivor. the poor and the middle class. we will be again told that it is just a small increase and that it is needed to keep our schools open and our roads paved. the pet projects will continue to operate in mostly darkness. 2019 marginal tax rates for reference: column 1: rate column 2: for unmarried individuals, taxable income over column 3: for married individuals filing joint returns, taxable income over column 4: for heads of households, taxable income over 10 0 0 0 12 9,700 19,400 13,850 22 39,475 78,950 52,850 24 84,200 168,400 84,200 32 160,725 321,450 160,700 35 204,100 408,200 204,100 37 510,300 612,350 510,300
 the anti-vegan circlejerk is mainly fueled by cognitive dissonance	disclaimer: i eat meat. whenever the topic of veganism comes up on reddit or pretty much any internet forum, people invariably start talking about how much they hate vegans and how preachy and annoying they are. but when's the last time you've actually encountered one of those stereotypical assholes? even as a meat enthusiast i have to admit that by most reasonable moral standards, meat eating is pretty fucked up. most meat eaters who bother to take a look at their own morals would probably find the same veganism is a moral good. this is what really pisses people off the cognitive dissonance between liking cute animal videos on your phone while eating a burger. the fear of being morally wrong, as yoda notes, leads to the dark side, whining on the reddit for internet points.
 Transexuals suffer from psychological/mental disorder/illness	men are humans with xy chromosomal dna; women are humans with xx chromosomal dna. a. two babies are born: 1. sarah is born with xx dna and six arms. 2. melissa is born with xx dna and a penis. on what medical basis can a doctor claim that sarah has been born with a physical deformity? and if being transgender is not a mental psychological disorder then on what medical basis can a doctor claim that melissa has been born with either a physical deformity or genetic disorder? humans with xx chromosomes may have different gender identities. humans with xx chromosomes have breasts. if a human has breasts and wants to make them smaller or bigger, go right ahead! but if a human has breasts and wants to remove them entirely then: 1. human has xy chromosomes 2. human has xx chromosomes and wants to compete in track and field more efficiently go ahead and remove those breasts! 3. human has xx chromosomes and does not think it s own breasts should exist this is a medical problem that is psychological or mental in nature. the breasts are not causing this belief that the breasts shouldn t exist the persons mental psychological problem is causing this belief any human can have any gender identify as far as i m concerned. but a human doesn t have a penis because of a gender identity and a human doesn t have breasts because of a gender identity. a human has breasts or penises because of genetics.
 highschool and lower sports coaches are way too intense when coaching anymore	so i'm 22 this year. i've been out of highschool 4 years now and i still see it when i go watch my cousin play sports. both schools in my hometown have record low numbers for kids in sports and they can't figure it out why no one will play. meanwhile i look over and the poor kid who missed a free throw is getting his ass chewed as if he killed someone. it's crazy how parents think that yelling and telling the kids to do better will make them a better person. i played sports my whole life from a kid to adult. i played baseball especially and had it ruined in highschool. my team's always sucked. always. and i knew it but i loved the game. so i early on learned to love the game and not the winning. i'm not saying i didn't try my hardest but i didn't cry and scream when we lost. and now that is common. i even had a kid when i was in school throw his glove down mid play while he was the pitcher and it cost him runs. and this continues. watching a highschool sport is like watching old leland from the tigers yelling at refs. it's a sport, let them enjoy it and lose some weight. i'd like some older people to speak up as well, was it this intense when you played 10 30 years ago?
 Incest is morally neutral.	i don't think you can come up with a moral argument that covers the entirety of incest, therefore incest is a morally neutral action. just for clarification, murder is a morally wrong action because in every case of murder you are taking away someone else's right to life. an argument has been made which covers every case of murder, therefore murder is morally wrong. for incest, the common arguments are: incest causes inbreeding, which causes genetic mutations are deformities in children. this is generally seen as a bad thing and should be prevented. incest is just disgusting. it's pedophilia these are just a few i can think of off the top of my head, so let's go through them quickly: not all cases of incest cause inbreeding. you can have sex without reproducing. this isn't a moral argument. just because you feel something is disgusting doesn't make it immoral. is drinking piss immoral? is eating shit immoral? parent child incest is immoral, i agree, but incest doesn't have to be parent child. what if it is brother sister?
 Most (non stem field) teachers actually have it pretty good	gonna use a high school history teacher as the example. time off: you get multiple months off work you get 2 weeks for christmas you get a week in the spring you get a large thanksgiving you get a bunch of half days you get snow days not always made up you get every holiday in the book you get 'professional days' still get some sick personal days job security: once you have tenure you basically can't get fired. unless you in the bottom subsection in the bottom 5 or commit a felony. you can be the worst person at your school for 15 years and stay, this doesn't happen nearly as often in the private sector. your coworkers and students can universally dislike you and you can stay, pretty rare in most other professions. your 'boss' can think you absolutely suck and you'll still get pay raises. you're basically are immune to layoffs since your 'company' is always needed amp; won't fail. the work day: 7:25 2:10 pm my district gt; less than 7 hours amp; includes lunch. you don't have classes all periods so your workday further shrinks to 3 4 hours. if you take the easy route you can grade your shit in school. 3 of 4 my buddies claim to do less than 5 hours of out of school work. you can use the same lesson plan every year so you can fuck around in 'planning periods' when you finish grading. if state regulations change you can use new public lesson plans. most lessons: teach 20 mins, give students a worksheet for 30 mins. chill at your desk. i see teachers grade all of them before the period ends. salary average starting salary for a history major 38,617 average starting history teacher starting salary 38,361 considering you work under 7 hours a day and work 36 instead of 52 does not include personal sick days hours of each: teacher 36 weeks x 7 hours x 5 days 1260 hours non teacher 49 assumes 15 days pto weeks x 1960 hours as you can see the teacher makes considerably more per hour, despite the salary being 300 lower. i understand this would not be true for math,comp sci, physics, etc. teachers. misc teachers get pensions only 16 of fortune 500 companies offer pensions, and that number further shrinks outside of those companies. this accounts for a fuckton of bonus pay over the course of retirement. teachers have notoriously good medical dental life benefits and get. chiller dress code than most of the private sector. people see you as a 'good person' in a noble career path unlike most private sector jobs. likely more fulfilling than most private sector jobs. i understand you can go way above and beyond and do a bunch of extra work outside school that would increase your hours. however very much seems like most teachers get their shit done in school my experience through school talking to from my friends who are teachers . those who don't have the option to get it done in school if they choose to give less fucks. disclaimer: i'm not referring to stem or similar in college major demand fields teachers, the argument above is for high school english history music art gym teachers.
 Megan Rapinoe's message isn't resonating with me, and I don't like her as a spokesperson	there are two reasons for this. i would find anyone else exhibiting these character flaws to be annoying as well. amp; x200b; 1. she openly wishes to only have conversations with people that agree with her. ie she wants an echo chamber. during an interview with anderson cooper, she stated she'd have a 'substantive conversation' with 'anyone' 'believes the same things we believe in. ' 2. again during an interview, this time with rachel maddow, she was asked what fans can do to help in the 'fight for equal pay'. rapinoe's response was to ask fans to buy more tickets, and to buy more merchandise. so, is the pay gap discrimination or not? if she truly believed sexism was the cause of the unequal pay, then more revenue wouldn't matter. and she's never even mentioned just how complex equal pay is in this context anyway. women's league players are on a different pay structure than the men are; and they are compensated differently. truly 'equal pay' would begin with a compensation structure that is identical. it's also annoying that neither cooper nor maddow asked her any follow up questions to these statements either.
 Social Media followers accrued while in office are a significant conflict of interest and should be forfeit once a person leaves office.	viewpoint if i was given stock in facebook and twitter when i enter congress and every day i am in office i get an additional share, it would create an obvious conflict of interest. that would not only be disclosable under house ethics guidelines house ethics manual. pdf , it would be disallowed as disclosure alone would be insufficient to overcome the potential conflict that would arise if, for example, i needed to vote on the regulation of social media companies. social media followers are monetizable not just by the platforms, but by the person being followed. someone with millions of followers can get paid for posts and for the advertising that is streamed through her feed. this creates a similarly perverse incentive as the example of receiving an equity interest in the social media company. amp; x200b; obviously, there are 1st amendment rights and other practical aspects of existing in our society. for example, getting paid for speeches after one leaves office should is and should be legal. i'm not saying that legislators shouldn't accrue followers while in office, merely that they should forfeit those followers they gain in office when they leave office. some might argue that the creation of a separate government id is sufficient as it creates a firewall for content. while i agree with this for compliance with ethics guidelines for communication, i don't think it dispenses with the significant conflict as they still own those accounts and can convert them to private, monetizable accounts when they leave office. amp; x200b; why this matters one thing that seems to be true regardless of media type and outlet controversy drives attention. if someone has a choice between creating consensus and losing social media followers or creating controversy which increases one's follower count, the perversity of getting paid on those followers when one leaves office incentivizes controversy and de incentivizes finding the more boring middle path of compromise. and i believe this is a bad thing in a representative democracy.

 Trump should be president till 2020	i think trump has become president because 100 million eligible voters didn't vote. and not because of russia's digital campaign. people should start accepting their mistake, about not going for voting and exercising their right to vote. they need to understand that, just making noise on twitter will not change anything. and to make change you have to go out and do it by yourself. source for 100 million count: term . d15eb248058c

 Notepad++ is a terrible text editor to code in Python	a few years back i would use notepad for my programming in c which was fine at the time. i then spent time using vscode to code in python. i made a huge project with hundreds of lines of python code, but it needed a couple of lines of python code and i was near a computer that did only had notepad installed and needed a quick fix. so i added the couple of lines of python code using notepad and everything looks indented like it should like in vscode, but when i tried to interpret the code with the python interpreter it gave indentation error issues. in this instance its terrible to transition from vscode to notepad to make a few additions and in this sense it is terrible to use notepad to code in python. this flaw in notepad might cause people to avoid using notepad altogether and settle with something like vscode, because people don't want to switch text ors just to code in a different language. in that sense more people may transition to vscode and leave other text ors just because how supportive vscode is. as stated before i used notepad for c so i'm not attacking a text or. notepad is more light weight than vscode, but not by a significant amount. the light theme notepad has is the only theme i like that is light. normally i would prefer dark themes like vscode's dark theme is quite nice. i really hope you can change my view that notepad isn't a terrible or to code in and that maybe i could be wrong.
 We should not support businesses/universities punishing their staff/students over private communications	i am mostly interested in discussing the following example as it is easier if we are all talking about the same thing but happy to hear other examples as well. i will take the recent incident we had in the uk where several university students were suspended for a year at warwick university because of a private group whatsapp chat made public where they made horrific rape 'jokes' about other female students. they 'joked' about gang rape, raping 100 women, mutilating women that they knew, ejaculating over the women when they were finished and even had many anti semitic remarks thrown in as well. no, unfortunately this is not an exhaustive list. make no mistake these guys are pieces of shit that's not what i want to debate. however, from what i gathered the police were informed there was never at anytime an actual attempt or plan to commit a crime. thus the police couldn't really do too much. i understand and agree that businesses operate to a lower standard of proof than govt agencies and have a right to associate or not associate with who they want to. however, i don't feel the guys deserved to be punished by the university because their thoughts were never meant to be shared with the wider public. in that regard how is it different to watching violent porn? why is it not equally legitimate to publish people's internet history and shun those with rape fetishes? hell i fantasise all the time about having sex with guys who would never be interested in me. not as extreme or as violent as these guys but the point remains that i have thoughts that would probably make a lot of guys uncomfortable if they knew and would be inappropriate to do in real life. should i be shunned by society for my thought crime? of course, if you have reason to believe someone is about to commit a crime, report it and let the correct government agency deal with it. but we as a society should respect that individuals should have privacy and will sometimes think of doing bad things! especially interested in hearing the female perspective here. i feel like i am missing something that is apparently obvious but i just don't see it!
 Bernie Sanders isn't a good candidate for president.	my opinion is threefold, based a lot on what i've heard from other people in my community. like my parents. gee, it sure would be nice if i had a better response to these arguments than i did 4 years ago firstly, bernie isn't so much the opposite of trump as he is the same thing on the other side of the aisle. sure he isn't a corrupt scumbag, but he fundamentally represents an unobtainable populist ideal and has a distinct lack of a plan moving forward. his platform has all of the financial planning as trump's proposed wall did, and none of the things he proposes are in any way realistic. all of it the free college, state sponsored medicare, etc are entirely knee jerk gut reactions, much in the same vein as trump's racist ideas, and have just as much political viability. secondly, there is strong evidence to suggest that bernie was also aided by the russians during the 2016 campaign. the 'berniebros' debacle aside, russian nationals and businesses also sponsored his campaign through donations and may have helped him create his grassroots campaign image by bolstering his numbers. no candidate running on the democratic side should be in any way tainted by russian influence otherwise republicans can simply point at us and say that we're no different from them. finally, he served as the principal reason trump won because he fundamentally acts only as a spoiler for better candidates. he is the ralph nader of the current day and split the vote for democrats between progressives and moderates, sowing discord in a party that should have been united all along. democrats in office are far more important than radicalizing the party platform, and by spending time arguing over ideologies we essentially handed the republicans control of the government. these arguments are why i took issue with him in the 2016 campaign. due to the more recent announcement, however, i think he would be a poor candidate for one key reason. he is not the candidate we need for this election. this election is not about pie in the sky ideals, but rather, it is about defending our nation from a clear and present threat to our democracy both internally and internationally. he is not the man for that job, and it is dubious whether he has any capacity to truly fight against the ills that have been exposed in us by the most recent administration. in fact, the 'bernie woulda won' memes aside, it isn't inherently clear that if he was to run against trump that he would win the election. more than ever right now, we need someone who would assuredly win this election so that democratic control can wash our hands of the mess wrought upon us in the form of a large orange clown. maybe somebody can help me see things a little clearer, and allow me to have some faith in a candidate that so many people on this platform adore.
 The United States is not a great country, and has a significantly lower standard of living than other developed nations	the united states is not a great country, and has a significantly lower standard of living than other developed nations. does america have one of the most powerful militaries in the world? yes. does america have one of the largest economies in the world? yes. does america have one of the world s most innovative tech centers? yes. but is america, right now, a great country with a very high standard of living? absolutely not. look at my home continent of europe, for example. compared to america, europe is very liberal. europe legalized gay marriage long before america did, and we also outlawed slavery long before america did. european countries are generally very liberal. which makes american conservatives look very right leaning to the rest of the world. did you know that in europe, hillary clinton is considered by many to be right wing? american conservatism had given america a bad rep. do you know why? because in the twenty first century, most people in general are liberal. they believe in equality for all, no matter the race or religion. american conservatives, on the other hand, are against many of the values that the rest of the civilized world holds true. some countries have even gone to such lengths to call american conservatism barbaric and fundamentalist. so why am i going on this big long rant? am i a die hard liberal? no, i'm not. but from what i've observed, america is no longer the shining gem in the world. that is reality. several factors have contributed to that, but a very major factor is that many modern countries look down on american conservative values and are outright disgusted. this has only been enhanced by the current political race. american conservatives are stereotypically seen as dim witted and bigoted. i say stereotypically, just like how a black person can be stereotypically viewed to be gangsta by some conservatives . unfortunately these stereotypes have now spread to define to all americans, thanks to the wonderful republican party. at the end of the day, the values of a major political party in the u. s are held to be barbaric in most of the world. that taints the reputation of the entire country. that's why i believe that the u. s. is not the greatest country in the world, or even great at all. i'll now go on to explain why i believe it has a significantly lower standard of living than other developed countries: the u. s. spends so much on 'defense' and i use quotes because it would be better labeled as 'offense' that it's silly sure, they own hundreds of aircraft carriers, and their defense budget is more than the sum of the defense budgets of top military spenders 2 6, but really, this is just wasting money. they end up starting wars for no freaking reason and then patriotism is jammed down the citizens' throats like they should be so glad they spent so many lives and taxpayer dollars on absolute bullshit. isis is another reminder: when the us decides to start a war based in nothing, it will bite them in the ass. what's awful, is that they as a nation haven't learned this lesson. crime is rampant education is a joke, college university costs ungodly amounts of money which causes many people to have crushing debt which they often spend the rest of their lives trying to repay. also, 14 of the entire country's population is illiterate. up to 80 of american males are circumcised. this is ridiculous that mutilating someone's genitals right after birth because 'it looks nicer' or 'it's healthier' it isn't . a person i know gave birth to a baby boy at a hospital in los angeles, and she was pressured by no less than five hospital staff to get him circumcised. i am shocked and disgusted that it's so common in america to flippantly mutilate children's genitals for aesthetics or a minuscule increase in hygiene practicality. this does not happen in europe. racism is rampant. the life expectancy in the u. s. is beaten by at least ten other countries a quick google search will confirm this the healthcare system is awful. and so on i know this will offend a lot of americans, but that's exactly why i posted this here: i want you to convince me that the united states is the shining gem of the world, a great country with a very high standard of living. try to cmv.
 The stereotype that male fashion designers must be gay makes no sense	where did the stereotype that men who made their living working in the women's fashion industry must necessarily be gay come from? think about it, the whole point of the job is to design clothes for hot chicks to wear. you'd be in constant contact with some of the most beautiful women out there. if you're a straight dude, why wouldn't you find that line of work appealing? besides, straight male artists myself included draw female characters all the time, which requires them to design clothes that look good on those women. if i were to browse through a male artist's gallery and see mostly female subjects in his work, i'm going to think he's straighter than an arrow. sure, straight men often draw male characters as well, but how much interest would your typical gay artist would have in drawing the opposite sex if they're more sexially oriented towards the same sex? on the other hand, i could totally see gay dudes getting into men's fashion, since they would be working with lots of handsome male models. but, as far i can tell, the stereotype about gay men and fashion design seems to apply only to those working with female models. what gives?
 For the Democrats to win the 2020 Election, they are going to need to put forth a MORE liberal candidate	i've seen a lot of rhetoric on reddit of people saying that for the democrats to win 2020, they are going to need to push for a moderate boring candidate and 'everyone else needs to fall in line' whatever that means. the problem i see with that assertion is that they tried that in 2016. hillary clinton is about as moderate as they come, she's white, and a complete snooze. she didn't inspire confidence and that's why she lost. had bernie sanders won the dnc nomination, we would probably have him as president as he inspired people. he got people to go out and vote. people loved bernie sanders. no one really cared about hillary clinton. with the current candidates we have, that 'boring moderate white person' is joe biden. now, i think people like him a lot more than hillary clinton, but he's not inspiring. he doesn't want to really change anything, and, most importantly, has no intention of ending the federal ban on marijuana nor implementing medicare for all. i think that for the democrats to win, they need to an opponent that can actually counter donald trump, who is one of the most extreme candidates in history. the dnc needs to push a candidate that is almost on the complete opposite side of the spectrum as donald trump to even have a chance. this is what gets people to go out and vote. the best argument i hear against this idea is that it turns off the moderate voters does it really? and even if it does, does that matter? america is fairly evenly split 50 50 on people that are democrat and people that are republican. i was a huge bernie sanders supporter and still am but i voted for trump as he wasn't the 'establishment vote', just like sanders. the way i saw it, clinton was just going to be 4 years of the same old same old and nothing will get done and that donald trump would be at least interesting. now 3 years later, i kind of feel like i was duped and i'm pretty ready to vote democrat in the 2020 election. but if it's not pete buttigeige, bernie sanders, or andrew yang, i certainly will feel crummy at the polls. i just don't feel like biden and especially warren could go up against trump like those guys could.
 Freedom of speech means the right to have and express an opinion, not to insult random people	i am not aware of how old days used to be. but what i do know that this world is not going in the right direction when it comes to freedom of speech and expression. the version of this 'freedom' that people are using essentially makes this world a worse place than it would have been. correct me if i'm wrong but freedom of speech means that you have the right to have and express an opinion without being silenced. it also kinda means that you have the right to spread and get information unless it concerns the security of someone or a nation . but in the modern world, this freedom has become an excuse to bully, abuse and insult people. common people, offline or online, media, politicians, etc all use this freedom really really badly. example from the world trump insulting and abusing people and journalists; politicians insulting each other; trevor noah and other comedians insulting trump, other politicians and people, pewdiepie insulting indians in the name of t series, indians insulting foreigners calling americans sluts, chinese people ching chong, etc , people making offensive cartoons memes photoshopped pics of politicians a guy made a pic of a politician marrying another politician ; eminem insulting presidents and other rappers; they insulting him back; racism, sexism and verbal abuse in online game servers, etc. let's not talk about the toxic debate between liberals and conservatives tell me if i'm wrong but none of these are speeches or expression or opinion or criticism of any kind. they are cheap and uncivilised insults, abuses and, in many cases, outright bullying. they don't criticize anything or any action, they just insult people and call it 'freedom'. many people say 'right to offend and be offended'. why? why should we have the right to offend people? why not criticize them? why not protest them? why just outright trolling, making offensive jokes about their personal lives. many people also say that i react too much and i should get a life and that if i have to stay in this world there will be lots like this. but why? why shouldn't we fight for a better, civilized world? why not a world of respecting people but just insulting people? i know i sound like a total idealist, but why not strive for an ideal world?
 Wearing a Blue Lives Matter shirt should not be allowed in the workplace	the blue lives matter movement is a false equivalency that bigoted people use to silence the very real issues of black lives matter. i am not going to change my view on that part. i need to change my view on the dress code though. wearing a shirt like that sends a message to people that you are racist. there is no room in the workplace for me to tolerate someone displaying this hateful message. there is also something insidious about letting it go on so long. i live in one of the whitest states in the union. feel free to ask any clarifying questions and i want my view changed. thank you
 American society focuses on homicide too much, and not enough attention is given to suicide.	america should focus on suicides as much if not more than homicides the former happens way more frequently than the latter yet many americans are ignorant to this fact if people care about minimizing number of lives needlessly cut short, then suicide prevention should be a top priority after all it is one of the biggest reasons for a drop in u. s. life expectancy people are more of a danger to themselves and yet for some strange reason homicide gets more attention
 Superman is a completely uninteresting character.	he's perhaps the most op comic book character ever, and certainly the most op mainstream superhero of all time. nothing can kill him, except for some obscure glowing green rock. so there's essentially no tension when he's fighting his enemies because you know he's gonna win, and never have to fear for his life or safety. he has a grab bag of nearly every power super strength, flying, x ray vision, super speed, laser vision you name it, he's got it. that's so uncreative, there's almost nothing special or unique about him. he just has it all, which makes it almost redundant for him to be in the justice league he has most of the other members' powers and is stronger than all of them combined . he has little to no personality, or at least a very boring one. even when i was a little kid and had no standards at all, superman still didn't interest me. i always watched batman, spider man, x men and justice league, but always skipped the superman cartoon. i just didn't care for it. that's why there hasn't been a good live action superman film since 1978, despite all the other big name superheroes batman, spider man, wonder woman, iron man, captain america, x men, etc. each having fantastic movies within the past decade. that really says a lot.
 All drugs ESPECIALLY opioids and amphetamines should be available for recreational use through legal channels.	my ideal system would be something that included a meeting with a qualified expert in the field providing the user with accurate and appropriate information regarding the substance they are interested in using much like the medical marijuana system before recreational was approved except recreational . this would eliminate the black market and unregulated manufacturing. it would eliminate the cost societal and monetary of the drug war. it would eliminate the shame currently involved with those reaching out for help amp; allow for more responsible decision making. it would also eliminate that primal hunter gatherer itch that gets scratched when you go out and score something you want. what do you all think?
 The overton window has shifted dangerously far to the left, severely jeopardizing America's future.	i don't know what's going on in the world today or what's changing so fast, but it's very concerning to me. we live in a world where people are openly communist here and feel safe saying so in public and nothing happens to them, but show a spark of nationalistic pride and you lose your job. i feel like communism both economic and cultural are destroying our national phyche. i just got downvoted to hell elsewhere for daring to question if the left in america has america's best interests at heart, as i pointed out that if they had our best interest at heart, why would they advocate bringing refugees and asylum seekers here? i've asked many of them why they believe such policies are what are best for america, and they never have a reason for me their responses are full of foreigner loving altruism. sometimes they'll mention economic benefits, but of course we could achieve that by hand selecting what immigrants we take in based on an appraisal of their worth to us not based on how oppressed they are elsewhere. that's the point i was making . let's take le pen in france for instance. they call this woman 'far right' over there? she's a freaking socialist! a communist ideology. i don't want to hear about the differences in the words of marty robbins 'communism, socialism, call it what you like. there's very little difference in the two. ' but what, she doesn't want totally open borders? wants france to have some semblance of its national identity? isn't a big fan of islam? and that makes this far left socialist a 'far right' figure as far as the media and all of europe is concerned? we can witness the rise of cultural marxism in so many ways the way veganism has taken off among our misguided youth once you get someone to hate their own nation and race and feel guilt about all the great things their forefathers have accomplished, it's a small step to get them to feel guilty for the superiority of the human race as well. gotta check that 'human privilege' i guess. disgusting we can witness it in the gender and class warfare going on in this country. people hating those who are successful, and thinking they're owed free stuff and that the government should be the ones giving it to them. i recently played through a 'could you help lead the eu' interactive game on a news website, and it was one of the most disgusting things i've witnessed recently. it gave me a choice of two people to appoint for a role, i picked one, and it said 'omg that's a lot of men running things, don't we need some women? ' when i clicked an option to put my own nation's interest first at the expense of others, it said 'woah, slow down there, you're not xi jinping' people are being systematically conditioned to hate their own nation, race, and even species. it's become commonplace on reddit and elsewhere for people to not even believe in free speech anymore free speech with exceptions is not free speech. if you can't say unequivocally that a nazi has an inalienable, absolute, undeniable right to demonstrate and speak his mind freely without fear for his personal safety or government persecution, you don't believe in free speech . i've worked with people from foreign lands in my job, and all of them believe free speech is 'overrated. ' we are literally importing anti american viewpoints here, letting them vote, and destroying our national identity. i think the only way out is to fight against all forms of communism with all of our might. admitting to supporting socialism, communism, feminism being the type of person who calls things 'racist' or 'mysogynistic' unironically these people should be treated the way we currently treat the 'far right' many of whom, like le pen, aren't even far right or right at all the horrifically shifted overton window merely makes them appear so . that's what should make people fear losing their jobs and being 'outed' in the media. not wanting what's best for your country and your people. i'm open to change my mind about these things. i try to debate these things at every opportunity on reddit, and almost without exception my opponents resort to name calling. ask them what good it is to bring refugees here and to tolerate people who don't speak english, and they won't answer just call me a nazi. hopefully you all are different. cmv.
 The pay-gap in Women's National Football is fair	unless specifically noted, this post concerns the state of women's football in the us and europe obligatory statement of my general views on the broader social issue at play: women have historically faced, and continue to face, unfair labor practices. there exists a general pay gap for equal work rendered in most industries, though it is not nearly as large of a gap nor simple to calculate as the often quoted ' 0. 72 per 1. 00 earned by a man' i enjoy women's football and believe it has proven value in the media entertainment cultural landscape. i am not persuaded by the argument 'men should be paid more for x sport because the worst men's team would still demolish the best women's team. ' amp; x200b; amp; x200b; why i hold this view: amp; x200b; men's and women's tournaments in the same sport are not 'equal work. ' the la times compared sports teams to assembly line workers who, unarguably, deserve the same pay whether they put together a low selling commuter car or a blockbuster high end luxury sedan. but athletes aren't skilled workers, they are performers, and their work is to entertain a specific audience . the audience is the work in this equation! both beyonce and justin bieber perform live music, but they are not doing equal work even though significant portions of their audience may overlap. amp; x200b; in the sports industry, revenue is generated not by the volume of goals scored, but by the volume of people willing to pay to watch it happen and buy products branded to their teams and heroes. amp; x200b; the men's world cup in russia generated over 6 billion in revenue, with the participating teams sharing 400 million less than 7 of revenue. meanwhile, the women's world cup is expected to earn 131 million for the full four year cycle 2019 22 and dole out 30 million to the participating teams just shy of 23 of revenue. factoring in the wwc's total team roster at 24 v. s. the mwc's roster of 32, the per team per player revenue share is substantially higher for the women's teams. amp; x200b; claims that the women's team in the us brings in more money than the men's team is cherry picked data. this is true for the past few years, but over the long term, the more established men s game brings in consistently higher game revenue year over year. amp; x200b; revenue sharing does not scale linearly; a fixed percent of revenue for both men's and women's tournaments is thus an unfair risk to the governing corporate body it pains me to say this i hate fifa just as much as everybody . in other words, committing 10 of 100 million in expected revenue is a much greater financial liability than committing 10 of 1 billion. amp; x200b; molly levinson, the spokesperson for the women s national team said, regarding their lawsuit, these athletes generate more revenue and garner higher tv ratings but get paid less simply because they are women. the data disagree. while the women s team broke viewing records in the us during the wwc, ratings for men s games have been more than double those for women s games, on average, since 2012, according to nielsen calculations. excluding world cup games, the men s team s ratings are almost four times as high. amp; x200b; the us soccer federation is genuinely good at rewarding top talent regardless of gender. according to figures provided by u. s. soccer, since 2008 it has paid 12 players at least 1 million. six of those players were men, and six were women. the best paid woman made about 1. 2 million from 2008 to 2015, while the top man made 1. 4 million in the same period. some women in the top 10 even made more than their male counterparts over those years. amp; x200b; to qualify for the women s world cup, the united states women s team plays five games in a single two week tournament. the men s qualifying road is a two year, 16 game slog across north and central america and the caribbean. u. s. soccer argues that the roster bonuses for successful qualification 15,000 for the women in 2015, 55,000 for the men in 2014 reflect that. amp; x200b; a wage gap is seen near the bottom of the most paid list when separated by gender. the no. 25 highest paid female player made just under 341,000, and the corresponding male player took in 580,000. at no. 50, the male player made 10 times as much as his female counterpart. this is due to the fact that the men's team plays far more many games per year and are paid by appearance as they earn most of their income from their lucrative club deals. amp; x200b; to account for the lack of a profitable women's professional league in the us all attempts to establish one have failed thus far , the ussf struck a deal with the women's players union to pay a fixed base salary to each player, regardless of appearances. a comparable 'pay for play' structure that is offered to the men's team would be financially devastating and unfair to the women's team talent roster. the men's system results in higher average pay per player, but this is a fair concession to the male players who receive nothing if they are not called to camp. amp; x200b; the lion's share of a star athlete's revenue comes from endorsement deals with private companies. nike will pay an athlete pari paso to what it thinks it can earn from increased sales. if the pay given to female athletes in these deals is unfair and or discriminatory based on sex, we would need to see the value generated by such deals against what similar male and female athletes were paid. afaik, this data is not available. further, endorsement deals are entirely based on negotiation what is 'fair or unfair' is subjective to each individual deal and the parties involved. amp; x200b; there is good reason to believe that fifa under markets, under supports, and under invests in the women's world cup. in their lawsuit, the us women's team refers to this as a 'manufactured revenue depression', but fifa's failure to fully capitalize on the growing popularity of the women's world cup does not mean players are being paid unfairly. it is not unfair to not pay players a share in revenue that doesn't exist because of fifa's incompetence. amp; x200b; fifa has generally been good at increasing compensation to female players as the popularity and revenue of the wwc grows. last year, fifa doubled the prize money for this summer s women s world cup, to 30 million, and has now pledged to double it again in time for the next ion in 2023. amp; x200b; the uswnt's contract with ussf is up for renewal, and they will do everything they can to further the rallying cry of 'equal pay for equal work! ' to achieve its best possible negotiating position. i do not think there is anything wrong with this, other than they are rallying behind what i view as a false claim that the 'pay gap' is not fair. amp; x200b; so, let's discuss! i would very much like to change my view on this as i generally don't like to agree with angry voices on the conservative right, but my feelings don't matter. i want to know if the 'wage gap' in women's football is fair or not. my view is that it is fair, and is on track to grow with the increasing popularity of the wwc, but my mind is open! amp; x200b; sources: gallery poster14. pdf gallery poster14. pdf
 The Non Aggression Principle applies to unborn children	as a right leaning libertarian, i believe that regardless of religious, social or any other reasons for being prolife, the fact that an unborn child has it's own distinct human dna means that the non aggression principle applies to it. the fact that a woman's body is necessary to the process of fetal development does complicate the situation obviously, but i think that because it is an unavoidable fact of nature that everyone who is alive today experienced that same process means that the actions of the child are not a form of aggression and therefore can not be used as a reason to commit an act of aggression toward the child. i would love to hear everyone's reasons why they believe it doesn't apply. if we could keep politics and religion out of the comments and simply focus on the specific topic i mentioned, i think it will be an interesting discussion. thanks!
 Gritty and "realistic" movies that are dark and depressing but have no real message past "Everything is shitty and you should feel shitty" are actively harmful and shouldn't be praised.	i am speaking of movies that try too hard and get praised by niche fans for 'pushing the ceiling' of cinema. for example, movies such as the poughkeepsie tapes, a serbian film, and the most infamous rape in all of cinema, irreversible, just rubs me the wrong way with what it's intended message is supposed to be. they're all setting out, no matter what the director pretends to say, to shock the audience. what value can there be possibly gained from seeing people be mutilated and defiled, and then at the end, have the film basically say 'wow, wasn't that fucked up? ' was the message 'don't be killed by serial killers, that's bad? ' in my own opinion, these movies don't dive into their shocking topics, and instead bank on your shock registering as being impressed by the movie. before you judge me as somebody who only likes 'happy endings', i will tell you right now i can enjoy bleak and dark stories a lot, provided that they give me something positive and impactful by the end. for example, the road is a really bleak film. like, 'i'm probably not gonna watch this ever again' levels of bleak. however, no matter how bad things got, there was always, always a ray of hope in the boy character. his relationship with his jaded father figure was a sight to see. that no matter how bad things get, hope springs eternal as long as they believed there was hope. that is a good message while still being surrounded by bleak and depressing imagery. movies like schindler's list, dear zachary and hotel rwanda, while bleak and dark, are also a positive force on people. it shows them how things are in the world right now, but at the same time, show that people live with it. they still focus on people who, while flawed, are ultimately good at heart. they have depth and you have reason to want them to not die horrifically or fail in their goals. movies are, at the end of the day, supposed to be an art form that lets us have an escape from reality, or at least, provide us with a new perspective on life. movies that only set out to make people feel like shit and not even have the decency to leave them with anything of substance to think on are just terrible movies, regardless of their technical aspects being impressive. irreversible had a an impressive soundtrack because it was made by one half of daft punk, but i still hate the movie's premise as a whole . one caveat: surreal horror like junji ito or lovecraft, while mostly bleak and makes humans powerless, i have no problem with because it doesn't make any sort of claims about being realistic or sending out any particular message. they're avenues of creativity, and i enjoy that a lot.
 You don't really value free speech unless you extend it to large privately owned platforms and corporations	before i start, i am not writing this with a very specific issue in mind, i have always believed this. i am sick of that perfectly true, but ideologically pointless argument that while you have free speech, privately owned platforms like reddit, youtube, fb etc don't have any obligation to allow you to express yourself on their platforms. this is very insincere way to 'support free speech' and is actually just the opposite, supporting censorship. i am personally from an european country that like most european countries doesn't even have anything like the right to free speech, although ironically i have to say that due to less pc culture there is very little censorship actually happening. but as a liberal, i have strong respect for the us 1st amendment, and since i agree ideologically, i naturally also believe that the principle should be upheld in private institutions and platforms as well. first, all big platforms used for communication and exchange of ideas are in fact privately owned although they are all from us : youtube, fb, reddit, even google apparently can remove content from appearing when you search for it. the point of free speech is partially being able to speak freely without fear of persecution, but the other important point is being able to exercise it in the first place, share your thoughts and ideas. people don't need to listen to them, but if your thoughts and ideas are virtually removed from every platform accessible to a normal person, this is the equivalent of burning books. you are made invisible. another aspect of it which oddly many other liberals seem to not care about is my right as a consumer of ideas to have access to everything and choose for myself what is good and what is bad for me. the discussion is often phrased as to protect people from upsetting content, but even if the content is trashing everything important to me and relevant to my identity, it is so much more disrespectful for someone else to decide that i should be protected from the chance of being exposed to it after which i can easily ignore it. again, it is book burning. , free speech is only your true value if it can actually be heard. having said that, i completely understand that certain environments need to exist where content is censored for two reasons first is that the content is very specific or that the whole point is some very specific formatting of submitted ideas e. g. changemyview can't accept askreddit posts, a channel focused on history can't show sitcoms . that is fine, compartmentalization is ok as long as the rules of it are clear and there is possibility for all kinds of content to be developed in it's own compartment. second is the emotional need for people to have safe spaces where their own ideas never get questioned or provoked again, this is fine too as long as everyone is entitled to the same, and opposite spaces. the real fear is free speech can influence people to do violent things, but i think that nothing short of providing illegal information e. g. doxxing an individual, or telling people where to go buy illegal weapons and organizing attacks should matter. art has since its inception had the liberty to examine all kinds of topics in its own way. some of the greatest works of literature include a book that is written from a pedophile's pov, book from a killer's pov, serial killer's pov there are classic paintings depicting torture and suffering. songs that talk about war, violence and hatred. human mind can go to dark places and get incredible inspiration from them that can intellectually enrich us. understanding the world around us, the good, the bad and the ugly, makes us informed. there will always be someone who snapps and who will go and do horrible things, and at every moment in time there was something else to blame for it satanic influence, a book, a song, a movie, a video game, a youtube video as we move through time these scapegoats are always whatever is relevant and still pretty new, but the principle is the same. actions are the responsibility of the person who committed them, ideas and thoughts need to remain visible for us to see, judge, discuss etc. there are bad ideas and bad ideologies, but the only way they should be addressed is though better ideas and better ideologies, not removal. furthermore, in judging what is a bad idea ideology, there is huge hypocrisy. many, maybe all, big and popular ideologies have resulted with some misinterpretation, radicalism, violence and harm to others from religions, to systems like communism, capitalism etc. so it is completely disingenuous to talk about misinterpretation when convenient but run and ban a piece of writing or a youtube video which is much less popular as soon as it gets linked to something violent. if a privately owned platform has a monopoly over communication, then they should be obliged to withhold the ideological principles of free speech, and the fact that they are pushed to do the opposite is shameful. in fear of bad ideas getting through, we are making it so that few people decide which ideas we can hear in the first place. you can't honestly stand by free speech and be ok with this as long as it affects ideas you don't like either. gt; the value of free speech us 1st amendment is completely compromised if you exclude from it the private platforms which have complete monopoly over communications, and idea knowledge exchange. if this is a true value you hold, you would insist that the principle of it is maintained so that no idea gets muted, and respect the dignity of the consumers of ideas to choose for themselves what to take in and what to make of it. what is the point of free speech if you can't exercise it?
 Porn performers donâ€™t deserve respect.	i m really quite sick of this narrative amongst certain hip sections of the press that porn stars are really cool, interesting people who deserve our undying love. they re not. they re glorified prostitutes. let s face it, what they do can t really be called work. it really annoys me that these people can have sex on camera and get paid handsomely for it, whilst other people have to do actual jobs, usually for far less money. i know it s down to market forces, but there is a part of it that irrationally makes me angry. at least actors, musicians, athletes and the like have generally worked very hard to get where they are, and most do have at least some talent. porn stars? their only talent is faking orgasms on camera. why do they deserve the trappings of fame? why are we supposed to respect their decisions to do this, when many of them are very intelligent people, who have degrees and could be doing very well in more respectable lines of work?
 Mocking or imitating an accent or a name shouldn't be considered racist by default just because it originates from a population that is primarily of a different race.	it is generally considered racist for americans to mock or imitate an accent from any country that's not historically majority white, or make jokes using names like wong in place of wrong . i'm not sure it should be. it's perfectly acceptable to do the same thing with any other accent that originates from any other historically majority white country, like france, ireland, or canada. why can't americans make fun of indian accents purely based on how they sound, but can use the same basis to make fun of zee germans? is simply being of a different race all it takes to automatically assume by default that there's a racial motivation behind the mocking imitating?
 Pornographic performers are more likely to be manipulative and unscrupulous.	i'm aware of statistical discrimination discrimination economics , and the logical fallacy of hasty generalization. i define 'performers' to include men and women. 'pornographic performers' 'pp' henceforth are those over 18 who perform regularly in pornography, not amateur or one timers. here s the argument for my view: 1. pp sacrifice and expose their body to earn money or gain fame fortune. 2. thus they are more ready or prepared to any legal, but unscrupulous, method to advance their career. 3. thus they are more likely to lie or pretend to be something other than they're not, to gain fame or fortune. question discussion e23k2aw 4. thus my view in this post's title.
 A content creator should not ask for donations	the only scenario when donations are acceptable is organizations and charities that improve our society no matter the amount of donations. i am thinking about red cross and medicines sans frontiers amp; x200b; a youtuber or blogger that spend thousands of dollars to buy equipment, a lot of hours creating content and uploading to the internet for free should not ask for money. why? because you decided to make it free. amp; x200b; my point is that i'll be happy to pay if you decide to make that youtube video or blog post paid. it bothers me because everyone is doing it, and it become really hard to do some research on the internet. too many affiliate links, sponsored content, ads. oftentimes you'll find those creators selling 'online courses' amp; x200b; i just feel that nowadays everyone is motivated by money, it wasn't the case a decade ago. i probably didn't formulated my pov correctly but i hope you get the point.
 Many mods are socially inept.	in my own experience specifically excluding this sub, i have no experience with the mods here mods tend to be extremely unfavorable towards non native speakers. rules for subs tend to be strictly written but broadly enforced, and requests for information tend to be shut down with 'you should read the rules'. of course, it makes sense, as a mod position is a position of anonymous power and thus likely abused. it tends to target individuals with very partisan opinions otherwise, why mod for that specific sub , those with too much time and too little to do. now, this doesn't make one socially inept per se, of course. nevertheless the trend i experienced is that mods tend to take very little time and consideration on their replies and tend to assume the worst in their conversation partners. a reply with 'have a good day' or ' i don't understand' tends to be brushed off with the threat of a ban. these are signs of an individual abusing their power, and signs of individuals not having learned that the carrot is better than the stick. as such, my experience is that mods are socially less adept than most people. cmv?
 Mugs are better than glasses in every way	mugs as so much better than glass cups. i find that every house has tons of glasses they drink water out of, but no one ever just drinks water out of mugs. why is that? they are so much better! mugs are: more durable. i've never broken a mug compared to countless glasses. easier to hold. they have a handle. that probably is part of the reason i have never dropped one. more insulated. they keep your drink cold hot a lot better due to their thickness. i see no reason why every home doesn't just use mugs exclusively. glasses are a waste of time. i am not arguing against plastic cups or water bottles however. purely against glasses.
 The heavy focus on the idea of a "covert racist" is a waste of time at best, a malicious distraction at worst.	i believe that we're spending too much time trying to figure out which of our politicians are and are not racist. the focus has been taken away from things that politicians have said or done that are outwardly racist alarming soundbite, blackface in old halloween costumes, things like that and towards more ethereal sources. today, a politician can be accused of being racist because of the company he choose to associate with. the idea of 'covert racist' being pushed around, the implication being that many politicians are racist but work very hard to avoid 'outing' themselves. i'm not here to argue that there is no such thing as a covert racist. in fact, i'm very sure that there is such a thing. what i do want to argue are two points. 1 it's unfair to accuse someone of being a covert racist before taking the time to truly try to understand their logic behind supporting a policy. there is a growing divide between the left and the right, and i have a very serious concern that the idea of the 'covert racist' teaches those on the left that they can't possibly understand the logic of someone who supports strong immigration laws or opposes affirmative action, because those policies 'only come from people who are secretly racist'. now more than ever we need to engage in healthy dialog and seek common ground. 2 if their policies are good, their intentions simply shouldn't matter. if a 'covert racist' is so good at hiding his racism that his policies are good for minorities, then i really don't care about his personal beliefs. by the same logic, if a well intentioned politician who cares greatly about minorities creates a policy that hurts them, he's got to go. intention doesn't matter, results matter. rather than arguing all day about whether or not a politician is secretly racist, start having a conversation about his policies and what you think of them. in my experience, it's much more difficult to go against the grain here. i've been accused myself of being a racist just for disagreeing with this new logic. so please, convince me why i should jump on the bandwagon.
 whoever leaks the Mueller report or Trump's IRS filings would be committing career suicide and going to prison, but would become national hero(es) by letting the American people know what they deserve to know.	gt;'patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it. ' mark twain anyone who does not expect and demand scrutiny of the government are not patriotic. the biggest patriots to the usa therefore are the ones who shine a light, even at great personal risk, on the parts powerful people want kept dark, probably because they have something terrible to hide. to deflect such scrutiny is not patriotic, and is only the work of stooges in an unjust system or blind followers in a cult. the topic is obviously partisan but that's part of the problem: issues of law abidance are partisan nowadays. it should never be a partisan question. love trump or hate him he should not be above the law. if you are willing to rationalize why or how trump does not deserve the same scrutiny as anyone else in his position, then you are part of the problem because he obviously owes us that. anyone in power does. and when we make the law a partisan issue, we all lose, because it shows that power is more important than playing fair. when people see those in power as illegitimate, social stability is the victim: why do i have to follow the rules if the guy with power and money doesn't have to? for those who take the cynical view that it has always been that way, then they are simply admitting america is not a meritocracy. but should be. and those who really love this country and its principles are those who make that so, by divulging what the powerful want hidden, no matter how large the personal sacrifice. which makes them the greatest kind of national hero, by definition.
 Democrats Trading DACA for Building the Wall Would Be Another Awful Mistake By the Democrats	daca for the wall funding is beginning to reappear in the media as a potential way for this government shutdown to end. i think that this would be an awful political mistake by the democrats if they were to accept this offer. they should not budge on funding for trump's wall as they have all of the leverage in this fight. the following issues listed below are why i think the democrats would be stupid to support wall funding. 1. democrats currently hold all of the political leverage in this fight. if trump gets the wall funding, his primary campaign promise will be fulfilled. if trump is not able to build the wall, he will lose the support of some right wing talk show hosts which will likely erode some of the support he gets from his base. no wall funding makes trump's reelection campaign much more of an uphill battle. 2. this type of solution would ultimately provide trump what he wants based on him shutting down the government. i think that this is a problem and a negative for this potential idea. 3. daca is just one issue that will be discussed in future immigration negotiations and probably solved in those negotiations . immigration will likely be addressed in one massive piece of legislation like we saw under reagan in the 80's as this gives both parties different pieces of policy to trade back and forth in negotiations. for the democrats, there is daca and 'asylum' or a pathway to lpr for the 30? million illegal immigrants currently in the country, along with overhauling the system to make the immigration process more efficient shorter wait times and more robust more legal immigrants accepted into the us to begin the process of becoming a citizen every year . for the gop there is primarily border security, reducing the amount of immigrants chosen through a lottery system and increasing the number chosen by a merit based system, e verify, and more low skilled visas for agriculture and other workers. for the gop, the biggest issue by far is border security. therefore, if the democrats provided additional border security funding whether the 25 billion discussed in the previous deal or the 5. 7 billion in this potential deal , they would weaken their negotiating hand in future deals considerably obviously it wouldn't be weakened as much if they gave up 5 billion instead of 25 . if they did this, they would also take away grassroots pressure on the gop from gop constituents to get a future robust immigration deal containing robust border security. therefore, the likely hood of comprehensive immigration reform and reform that contains the democrats biggest ask, a pathway to lpr for all of the illegal immigrants that have not committed major crimes currently in the us would be almost impossible to achieve. because of this, i think that daca for border security funding is negative in relation to future negotiation of immigration bills. ultimately, it comes down to how much a person values an immediate daca fix vs how much they are aware of and care about the context of future immigration negotiations. i think it would be a major political and policy error by the democrats should they accept this trade. in politics, usually their are two choices, bad and worse, this immigration fight is a prime example of that fact for immigration reform advocates.
 Dodging the Draft was not Cowardly or a Reason to Look Down on Someone	people love to shit on people who dodged the draft, especially if they are famous. some good examples are muhammad ali and donald trump. i don't understand this at all. why the fuck would you want to be forced to kill people if you don't want to? man, i love the usa as much as the next guy but i'm not willing to murder people to stay in it or to help it. i'll move somewhere else. i have a wife and two daughters. not a chance in hell i'm getting shipped to vietnam to possibly die or kill people. people actually blame and shame other people for not wanting to do that? it blows my mind. i'm not saying people who dodge are honorable either. i am just indifferent to it. i understand why you would do it and don't look down on people who did. i can fully admit that if a draft was instituted today and i was drafted, i would be in australia the next day. my daughters are not growing up without a dad and my wife isn't going to live on as a widow and a single mother. even if i was single i wouldn't. as much as i love this country, i would not be forced to kill other people for it how could you possibly look down on people who dodge a draft?
 The "Soap Opera Effect" is not undesirable. Movies and TV should be shot at higher framerates.	by 'soap opera effect,' i simply mean higher framerate video. i'm not specifically defending motion interpolation interpolation , which 'fakes' a higher framerate by inserting frames, but i appreciate what it is trying to do, which is to compensate for low framerate source material. in this r movies post cruise urges home movie watchers to turn off , i was surprised by how many people presumably people who care about video quality and the viewing experience disliked the idea of movies and tv being shown at a higher framerate than the ancient 24fps standard. i feel the opposite way. if the purpose of film is to make you feel like you're watching real people, places, and events, than 60 fps will do this better than 24fps every time. 24fps is rife with motion blur that obscures what is happening and robs you of information. recording at a higher framerate simply gives a more accurate representation of what is being filmed. some seem to argue that this blurriness makes for a more believable viewing experience. by that argument, shouldn't you also prefer watching at a lower, blurrier resolution? admittedly i come from a gaming background where 24fps would be a joke; unplayable for any modern game. but i also love film and tv. i believe that when it comes to framerate, the type of media is irrelevant. higher framerates are always better. movies and shows made today should be shot at 60fps . i thought this view would be the norm, but since many seem to disagree, am i missing something? if so, change my view. tldr: higher framerate video is desirable. preferring lower framerates is silly, and is comparable to preferring lower resolutions.
 Saying an abortion is a choice to be made only by a woman "and her doctor" is just a way to legitimize a choice that is actually only the woman's.	i'll be upfront i'm not pro choice. i'm not sure i would call myself pro life, either, since i think both sides take extreme positions that make it hard to identify as either one without adhering to some pretty radical ideology. that said, here we go: i don't really get why the doctor has any say in the matter. if you're pro choice, isn't it really only the woman's decision? if a woman wanted an abortion and the doctor disagreed, wouldn't every pro choice person side with the woman? i get that a woman needs a doctor to actually agree to perform the procedure, but that doesn't mean it's his her choice. the doctor's opinion, medical or otherwise, shouldn't have any bearing on the woman's choice. this leads me to believe the only reason 'and her doctor' is included at all is to give the woman's choice some legitimacy. a doctor weighed in, and he she is a medical professional, so now the woman's choice has a stamp of approval. but, in reality, we don't want to really give the doctor that kind of power, do we? i can think of one exception, and that's if the abortion could be more harmful to the woman than no abortion. but, even then, is that the doctor's decision? if a doctor told you that you can't run a marathon because you have a heart condition, it's still your choice whether to follow his her advice, no? i get an abortion is a bit different since it takes the doctor's participation, but that's less about the doctor taking away the woman's choice and more about not being able to force the doctor to perform a surgery against his her will because the doctor has body autonomy, too , right? cmv
 *Women* are subhuman compared to men! Despite being incompetent or weak they often have better lives than their male counterparts!	gt; 1 why do you hold your view? include any experiences or other background information that may have led to its formation. i hold my view because i observe it every where and essentially every minute. i think weak and incompetent people don't deserve happy lives. women find themselves in positions of life that real hard workers would kill for. and they are malicious about it, as oppose to being greatful and humble. and this maliciousness if defended and sometimes encouraged against men who very obviously have it harder. the best 'anecdotal' evidence i have is the fact that mgotws, red pillers, incels, and the hapas subreddits all seem to come to the same conclusion that women's bevaior is predictable and often 'samey'. not similar. the exact same language and actions along with the rationalizations. the whole npc thing applies to women by in large. keep in mind those subreddits have very different views from one another. they aren't at all a monolith yet they have found common ground on one thing. ok. so. why? gt; 2 do you know what might change your view? is there anything specific about common counter arguments that you find unconvincing? the most common counter arguments are usually whiteknighting, ad hominen attacks, and poisoning the well. the ones that delve deeper are often ethereal egalitarianism. 'but like puffs blunt we're all equal, man. ' i'd gladly change my view if someone could answer these questions not even all of them, just some : did you know that women have less grey matter as well as less brain mass? do you know what grey matter does? bonus: why are these facts so uncommon and seemingly surpressed? if you look up articles you get conflicting answer but if you look at scientific studies they're all transparent and consentient. why are there different chess leagues for men and women? chess is a mental game, no? bonus: why isn't this fact more common? if you tell people this most of them are surprised. you know that women are physcially weaker but do you know how much? why are there more male to female transgenders than vice versa? is it easier to be a woman somehow? why or why not? did you know that early humans reproduced at a rate of 18 females to 1 male? what do you think of that? why does it appear that women select the 'top' men, indiscriminant of their 'bad' personality traits? assuming this was true, would it matter to you? what do you make of tinder experiments? what do you make of the phenomenon known as 'chadfishing'? do these 'experiments' hold any water to you? let's say there was a random race of people who had green skin. all the men in this race had less grey matter than average and were physically weaker than every other race. how would people react to these individuals? should they be equal with the races that are superior in everyway? ok. would you expect them to be in better affairs than the other races. should a person succeed in life becuase they are goodlooking? should they go beyond succeeding? for example, getting away with a crime? are you aware that women get lighter sentences even for the same crime as men? do you think there is a bias in favor of women? bonus: if there is what is to be done about it.
 States and countries with Romeo and Juliet laws are condoning child rape.	i live in the uk where the age of consent is 16. this is the age at which politicians in the uk have decided that a young person is developed enough to be able to provide informed consent to sex. i may very well be biased on account of living in a country where it s 16, but i believe 16 is probably the right age for western cultures. factors which need to be considered for informed consent include: ability to consider the long term implications of actions ability to deal with the consequences of actions being physically and mentally developed enough so that sexual activity does not cause harm according to ageofconsent. net the following states have a close in age exemption: alabama alaska arizona arkansas colorado connecticut delaware district of columbia florida hawaii indiana iowa maine mississippi new hampshire new jersey new mexico north carolina ohio oklahoma pennsylvania rhode island tennessee utah vermont and virginia the majority of these states do not punish young people for having sex with children as young as 13. amp; x200b; these laws suggest one of two things: 1. the state believes that children as young as 13 are able to give informed consent. 2. the state accepts that children as young as 13 are not able to give informed consents, but does not wish to punish young people who engage in sexual activity because of the long term consequences of being a registered sex offender. i suspect it is more likely that option 2 is what the law makers had in mind when passing close in age exemptions to age of consent laws. i can't really get my head around this though if you know that at 13 a child can be harmed by sexual activity, then why would anyone ever make it legal?
 No, children do not need to be "socialized" with other children.	my wife and i both agree that it is a stupid vestige of social thinking that children need to be socialized with children their age. we think it's important for our children to be exposed to all different demographics, age groups, etc. but we believe that it's much more beneficial to the child to primarily socialize her around adults responsible one's at that. when you consider that as a parent your job is not only to raise a child, but to raise the adult that they're going to be, this philosophy makes a lot of sense. from our brief experience sending our eldest daughter to school, she did not noticeably benefit in any other way than having play time with the other children. we almost considered keeping her in school just for the recess. but because we all kept getting sick, our daughter said that she didn't want to go to school any more. we agreed and took her out of school since then we've all been doing a lot better. she's had several adult playmates throughout the last year in the form of tenants. it's worked out really well to have young adults yes, men can be trusted with children too! spend time with her and we've noticed she benefits much more from this type of interaction. the point is that we have not noticed any benefit that children can offer other than their sustained energy and ability to entertain each other in ways that most adults find repulsively bland. our next step will either be to find a friend who is her age or continue to rely on friendships that she cultivates throughout our lifestyle of creating shared living environments. what do you think? is it important for children to be socialized primarily with other children? why or why not?
 The comforts of modern life should make us euphoric, and the fact that they don't is troubling because it suggests the human perspective is critically flawed.	today, i awoke in a temperature controlled room, shared with my life's partner, on a piece of furniture specifically engineered for comfort while sleeping. i slept soundly, thanks to the lack of interruption due to predators or pests. when i awoke, i walked over a cushioned and carpeted path into a room designed for my personal cleanliness, before washing myself in the luxury of temperature controlled water with various soaps and liquids specifically engineered for caring for my skin. after this, i dried myself with a fluffed cotton towel, before pulling clean, colorful clothing from a 1500 dresser set. i retrieved my state of the art cellular device, before reviewing the variety of communications waiting for me from friends and loved ones, along with educating myself on daily news events with the swipe of a finger. i then pressed a button to produce a brewed coffee more delicious than any trading post would have dreamed of 100 years ago, while adding gourmet hazelnut flavoring. i fed my pleasant fur companions, all of which who were happy and in good health. i hopped into the cushioned seat of my car, which is worth several thousand dollars, selected the exact artist and song from the last 50 years that i wished to listen to, and then moved 3 times faster in my car than what would be biologically possible, all while breathing in air at the exact temperature i find comfortable. after this short journey, i arrived at a temperature controlled building, greeted with a task that if completed correctly, would grant me more 13x the pay that an average sub saharan african would make in the same day. while doing so, i once again selected the exact musical artist from a selection of millions that would suit my tastes for the day. at no point was i concerned with hunger, sickness, predators, violence, or any other of the standard unpleasantness that have been faced daily by 99 of all mammals that have ever existed. and yet, throughout this process, i grumbled over my alarm, grumbled over work, grumbled over my budget, grumbled over what others had that i did not, etc etc. when comparing my life to someone in the same country, at a similar social class, 200 years ago, my life is incredible and filled with conveniences and luxuries that they couldn't even dream of. and even those people in the 1800's were living lives that were free of most of the burdens that other living things face daily. so why hasn't the modern american had an increase in happiness that correlates with the increase in improved quality of life over the last 300 years? tl;dr my cushy modern western life is amazing and its stupid that i'm not in a state of euphoria 90 of the time.
 If Antifa was truly anti-fascist, theyâ€™d be organizing protests against wars and the worst abuses of the government. Since theyâ€™re not really doing this, I conclude that theyâ€™re primarily interested in seeking out street fights.	antifa's stated position here is antifa s position, as i understand it. authoritarian conservatives are fascists, and neo liberals are fascist enablers. donald trump is the closest the us has had to a hitlerian figure in modern history. any decent person should be vigorously protesting the fascistic trajectory of the us. who antifa should be protesting i don't agree with the broad use of words like fascist. but, let's put that aside for now. given antifa's premise, you would expect them to devote the lion s share of their energy to the worst abuses of the us the government. the government is currently murdering large numbers of people in yemen. military companies bribe politicians to continue wars. the us invades countries and then auctions off the region s oil to politically connected companies. it intimately allies itself with brutal dictators in places like saudi arabia. across the world, it gives weapons and money to various militant groups in order to destabilize governments that it doesn t like. there is a drone program which kills large numbers of people with no trial. this includes american citizens. it also includes large numbers if innocent bystanders in foreign countries. the us imprisons people without trial. sometimes, it ships people to prisons run by brutal dictators. it runs a large scale surveillance program. and there s more. all things considered, i understand why people sometimes use words like fascist. if people want to rail against these abuses, then i support them. who antifa is actually protesting but these crimes do not seem to be the primary focus of antifa. sure, many people will agree that these things are problematic. but where are the protests? antifa is constantly in the news for rioting. but, they primarily seem to riot against culture war stuff. they protest people who say things that they deem racist, or sexist, or homophobic. they protest people who express nationalistic or xenophobic sentiment. they ll make a city look like afghanistan if milo yiannopolis give a speech. but they don t show nearly as much enthusiasm over guantanamo bay, or the drone program, or the nsa, etc. why aren t they rioting outside guantanamo bay? why aren t they throwing milkshakes at james clapper or any of the countless other neocons who perpetrate the worst abuses of the us government? i get it. some people on 4chan are assholes, and a lot of people in antifa want to punch them. but, should antifa s highest priority really be the makers of racist frog cartoons? aren t there much bigger fish to fry? if you really think the us is becoming fascist, you don't divide your time between smoking pot in portland and beating up conservatives when have gatherings. you target the military industrial complex. you riot outside halliburton's offices. you travel to palestine, or guantanamo bay, or any of the countless other areas where the government is engaging in evil actions. you organize anti war protests in dc. you join humanitarian organizations. you engage in journalism to document abuses. etc. if the us has become nazi germany, antifa does not seem to be taking it seriously. they're seeking violence because its fun given antifa s strange priorities, i conclude that they re not really focused on fighting the worst abuses. they re not picking fights with the most powerful institutions. instead, they seek out gatherings of people which much less relative power. they re looking for people who are accessible and less dangerous. this makes sense if they really just want to get in fist fights. they have the same motivation as football hooligans who trash a city when they re team loses. they take part in violence because they re generally upset, and riots are fun. they cosplay you should also take into consideration the fact that they cosplay while they protest. this isn t how serious people behave. if they re really trying to change hearts and minds, it isn t helpful to dress like the bad guys from mad max. they look like villains. this is the behavior of people who are essentially larping. they ve just traded a styrofoam sword for a crowbar. instead of fighting imaginary orcs, they fight people in maga hats. conclusion these are not really anti fascists. these are larpers who seek out weak opponents. they may express condemnation of institutional abuses. but, they re not organizing serious protests against people with power. they re immature because they obsess over culture war conflicts, while not giving nearly as much attention to the most serious issues.
 The current rise of populism and regressivism are not the result of an insurgence of racism or "postmodern marxism", but by postindustrial capitalism.	i have been following this discussion for quite a while now and i see two general narratives. on the left we see the narrative that populism is rising because of institutional racism and patriarchy, and they blame everything on the right. on the right we see the narrative that western society is being destroyed by the postmodern marxist sjw's. i think there is something different going on, these movements aren't so much about ideas but about identity. because of neoliberal globalisation countries and communities are starting to lose their national and cultural identity. because of immigration from foreign cultures all around the world this erodation seems even worse than it is to most people. then there is the fact that religion is becoming less and less important in the west, the innate alienation that comes with the capitalist mode of production, and the increasing divide between rich and poor. lastly the postmodern movement basically destroyed every metanarrative that we could cling to. combine all of these factors and we are left with an anxious population with no identity or purpose in life. i think this is why we see so many movements focussed around identity lately. we see white nationalists, god knows how many genders and subcultures, and an increasing tendency towards extremism in every movement all because people are in desperate need of a purpose and an identity. however people seem to blame the symptoms rather than the actual problem. we can keep blaming everything on 'institutionalised patriarchy' or ''postmodern marxism', but i think it is much more valuable of we focus on the capitalist mode of production and quickly accelerating globalisation that are causing both extremism on the right and the left.
 The Republicans are Philosophically Bankrupt, and are Causing the Collapse of American Democracy (Which was Flawed in the First Place)	so here s my view: the republican party is philosophically bankrupt, and are causing the collapse of american democracy which kind of sucked to begin with to give you a frame of reference of where i m coming from in this argument, i was raised in a centrist household, and heard a lot of political talk in my household get boiled down to the classic both sides do bad things argument, which i, up until a short while ago, took in stride this is something i still believe, but to make the leap and say that both sides are equal is frankly absurd and anyone that believes that really needs to look into the differences between the two parties actions the faustian bargain republicans are philosophically bankrupt, and the fact that people need to be convinced that that s the case is actually strange ever since the republican party s southern strategy in the election of 1964, they have been courting white racists in a bid to build a coalition to rival the democratic one the republicans cleverly tried to repackage anti desegregationism as states rights in order to tow in centre to centre right voters, so as not to appear as the actually racist party this was a faustian bargain that has finally caught up to republicans over half a century later, but it s making our entire country pay for it . the far right exists, since the 1960s, only inside the republican base the far right on their own weren t large enough to make a large coalition in congress, and the republicans couldn t win, at least initially without racists either outright or closeted , and so their alliance was built out of necessity, along with christian conservatives, neo mccarthyists, neocons, libertarians, and corporate interests i m not necessarily saying all those groups are bad, but what has happened is that all those groups have bled into one another the segregationists managed to repackage themselves as traditional values supporters, things which appealed to christian conservatives their militant white nationalist beliefs shifted to being militant about other stuff, like thinking that democrats were socialists and this bled into the modern neocon and neo mccarthyist crowds and in the case of some libertarians, their packaging of states rights spoke directly to supposed small government supporters there has been a slow takeover of a lot of the republican base as the original white supremacists co opted the language of other groups i m not saying every republican elected has been one where a bunch of groups were all puppeted by white supremacists do i think that the bushes or reagan were specifically banking on white supremacy no, not remotely but they did benefit off that faustian bargain, even if they were unknowing about it and this co opting of other political groups language has ensnared a lot of centrists too, who support a lot of really shitty candidates because they think about the economy ! and it s that initial grab of others language that slowly exposes the initially centre to centre right people to the community of farther right people, and eventually, blends the lines between their views this has been greatly accelerated by the advent of the internet . when someone is looking up a political topic video and then are immediately shown a prager u or ben shapiro ad, they are predisposed to looking into that view and the left, usually doesn t do this anywhere near as much as the far right i myself almost fell down the rabbit hole of being an anti sjw free speech advocate, even as i still held the guise of being centre. i know this is true for a lot of other people, because it happened to myself and frankly, the 2016 and even 2018 elections prove that where americans think the political centre is, is actually a lot farther right in some cases than they d like to believe, because in the minds of those centrists they re not conservative, they re just pro free speech, and anti leftist censorship again, co optation of language then you take into account facebook, where we most often are friends with people in our area, and you get conservative areas spiraling into the far right because they can see a vaguely nazist viewpoint repackaged into neutral language, and then without anyone to explicitly say, that sounds kinda racist , they think it s actually normal and so they might share a similar view, or look at some altright talking point video on youtube and then youtube recommends them another one, and another one and oh look, a spiral into nazism we go it s citizen made propaganda and the republicans aren t explicitly to blame for centrists and conservative unknowingly descending into white supremacy, but they did enable that behavior in the first place, and still capitalize off of it happening liberal areas don t have this nearly to the extent of the faux conservatives, and honestly even when they do, it s usually aimed for justice, and being more conscious of societal discrimination, or combatting fascist views of the far right hell, going back to the point on co opting language, just look at what authoritarians have done to the word justice. justice in the practice of governance is usually equated to a couple things, namely equal treatment of individuals often taken in modern contexts to specifically focus on crime , or doing that which is right authoritarians have essentially co opted what justice means for the left when they talk about justice they talk in the framework of justice being a sort of product of liberal social justice warriors to limit free speech . the term sjw is a pejorative term for authoritarians, true conservatives, centrists, and even some one the left back to the point of areas becoming more radicalized, it s been proven that the right has become more radicalized faster than the left right wingers have killed 10 times as many people in terrorist attacks than the left wing. term . bc70a3786224 that statistic comes from a conservative think tank we can even look at the average ideology of congress images housenew. png and you can see that overall, the republican party has radicalized much faster in congress than the democrats deal with the devil, but we pay for it philosophical bankruptcy is a term i don t use lightly, but it s also one i have to define in this case to me, philosophical bankruptcy is essentially ignoring the fundamental enlightenment esque values that our government was built on basically, the idea for our government is that we should firstly, be able to elect a body of representatives that will accurately reflect our societal views, and assure we have a voice in government even if your views are stupid and monstrous, you have a right to have a voice in government if there are enough of you secondly is that we have checks and balances on the political system, and thirdly is that each branch of government should try to find relative common ground to work for most people a roundabout way of saying the government should compromise and work for justice and it shouldn t surprise you that i m going to say that republicans, have not abided by this at all in recent years . over the years, republicans obstructed 71 court nominations, including failing to even hold a vote for merrick garland s supreme court seat republicans blocked health care for 9 11 responders republicans refused support for intervention in the syrian civil war, even after chemical weapons had been used, but conveniently changed their tune once trump took the reins republicans filibustered many bipartisan bills too part of john boehner s and mcconnell s scorched earth approach to never compromise such as student loan affordability, paycheck fairness act, small business tax crs, political finance disclosure disclose , closing loopholes for tax evasion, and incentives for bringing jobs back home so that part of common ground is thrown out of the window and despite this republicans still manage to blame democrats for being obstructionist, even when they re in the minority in the senate and house . and guess what it works virtually everyone in the republican coalition does not care, or genuinely believes that democrats are the real problem in politics this coincides a lot with the anti intellectualism part of republican doctrine they don t care about the overwhelming evidence of climate change they don t care about the fact that immigration is one of the strongest parts of the us economy they don t care about trump decrying all news against him as fake news in fact they don t care about evidence much in general kavanaugh s hearing was depicted on the right as a leftist witch hunt they flat out refuse to protect the investigation of robert mueller, which should honestly be kind of a no brainer just let the man finish his job! they warp and deny reality, and feed into the emotion of irrational bigots who are their audience then you have republicans actively subverting the will of the people and trying to take away power from minorities in the country republicans routinely try to make it harder for people of color to vote under the guise of a threat that doesn t exist but the president continues to perpetuate as the reason he lost the popular vote the whole voter fraud scandal they have tried everything in their power to keep people away from the voting booths and when the vote happens and it s a close race, and an automatic recount is called for, they try and deny it from happening and they tamper with elections even more by actively committing voter fraud and even when they lose, they gerrymandered the country so hard back in 2010 that they still win substantially with less than half the vote . democrats in wisconsin won 53 of the vote, but 36 of seats ohio republicans won 52 of the vote, but 75 of seats north carolina republicans carried 50 of the vote, but 77 of the seats and in texas it was 50 of votes for the republicans, and 64 of seats democrats did this in some states too, which is still extremely bad, but nowhere near the size and scale of the republicans republicans also stole 7 us house seats in the last election. and in wisconsin and in michigan, even when gerrymandering is already prevalent, and republicans lost their respective gubernatorial races, republicans have voted to strip executive powers of the governors and attorney generals. that s nothing short of a power grab that s only legal because there s technically nothing against it . and there s a whole saying for how democrats are supposed to respond they go low, we go high but again, the responsibility of being compromising, rational, and intellectual is left to the party doing far less of the real and lasting damage to our democracy and even when democrats act compromising, they are called obstructionist even when they act rational, they get called unsustainable or idealistic and even when they are intellectual, they get called out on promoting the liberal agenda which i want to point out, no shit that s literally their job, it just so happens that the majority of the liberal agenda is either focused on egalitarianism or science and whenever things go sideways for republicans they claim it either didn t happen or say that whatever it was, wasn t a big deal this has been the case for the last 3 years american democracy was already flawed, republicans just exploited it so the third part of my opinion is that american democracy kind of already sucked, and republicans have just ruthlessly exploited the shortcomings of the founding fathers, and the democrats have been too complacent with the current system they should practically be calling for revolution at this point, but so the slow boil goes the system is super flawed the electoral college is broken and has ruined 50 of the last 4 elections it uses plurality for voting for one thing, which discourages people from voting for whatever candidate they actually want also the popular vote is really more of a suggestion than a guarantee of winning even if you win both the electoral college and popular vote, you can still get your win revoked when the college meets the senate is really stupid really smart for its time, but at the moment really stupid it was made so that geographically diverse areas would stay in the union and have a voice well, we ve kind of solved any secession disputes at this point, and splitting the country up based on geography would be near impossible without cutting corners it gives small states way too much power which literally makes their votes worth far more than those of big states it should really be abolished, since there s not a huge point for it anymore instead double the amount of house representatives, because the current apportionment of people per representative is appalling the current apportionment is per 700,000 people and is also susceptible to gerrymandering, neither or which were an intended feature it started at one rep per 60,000 people doubling it would bring it down to 350,000 maybe we could triple the house size and bring it to 230,000 this problem only gets larger the longer we wait all legislatures should use member based proportional systems. this would also give third parties their actual number of votes they got in the election also there should be a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united, because it s a frankly absurdly undemocratic decision, that also consistently throws elections to whoever can outspend the other person anyways, that was kind of a collection of multiple views, but i hope i gave enough of an indepth explanation
