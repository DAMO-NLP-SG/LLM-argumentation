It could help couples resolve problems with fertility.	The human cloning process could help to generate new advances in medical science.
Officers in Ely, Cambridgeshire, said those who claimed to be sleeping rough were actually fraudsters who were making substantial amounts of money.	The comments came as Cambridgeshire Police responded to reports of a large increase in begging in Ely, which has a population of around 20,000.
Intellectual Property Helps Generate Breakthrough Solutions to Global Challenges	In turn, this process leads to new innovations and improvements on existing ones.
Many women wanted to play an active role, and hundreds of voluntary women's auxiliary and paramilitary organisations had been formed by 1940.	In addition to the military nurses, a small group of civilian nurses dubbed the Bluebirds were recruited by the Australian Red Cross Society and served in French hospitals [ref].
The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined.	According to Huntington, multiculturalism had attacked the identification of the United States with Western civilization, denied the existence of a common American culture, and promoted racial, ethnic, and other subnational cultural identities and groupings [ref].
Many children fail to exercise because they spend long periods of time engaging in sedentary activities such as computer usage, playing video games or watching television.	In a 2009 preschool study 89% of a preschoolers' day was found to be sedentary while the same study also found that even when outside, 56 percent of activities were still sedentary.
High immunization coverage has resulted in drastic declines in vaccine-preventable diseases, particularly in many high- and middle-income countries.	A reduction in the incidence of a vaccine-preventable disease often leads to the public perception that the severity of the disease and susceptibility to it have decreased.1 At the same time, public concern about real or perceived adverse events associated with vaccines has increased.
Population movements also put pressure on food supplies and on food distribution.	The process of urbanisation has positive as well as negative economic and social changes.
In 2007, one study of amateur boxers showed that protective headgear did not prevent brain damage [ref], and another found that amateur boxers faced a high risk of brain damage [ref].	It was banned in Sweden until 2007 when the ban was lifted but strict restrictions, including four three-minute rounds for fights, were imposed [ref].
Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality.	Furthermore, the reduction in fertility rate in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment [ref].
As reported in USA Today, what would benefit children more is periods of rigorous physical activity that makes them break a sweat.	Further expounding on the issue, MSNBC also analyzes a major study of physical education programs conducted by Cornell University.
Even breathing in low doses of cigarette smoke can increase one's risk of heart attack, said David Meyers, M.D., M.P.H., professor of Cardiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine and lead investigator of the study, which is the most comprehensive analysis of related studies to date.	Interestingly, public smoking bans had a stronger effect in reducing heart attacks among women and younger individuals, which may be explained, in part, because younger people tend to frequent clubs, restaurants and bars where smoking is a likely part of the social scene, said Dr. Meyers.
Quoting Harvard economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, Few propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards [ref].	The flow of migrants to advanced economies has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge.
Additionally, children may not understand that they are being sold something, and are therefore more impressionable [ref].	Unsolicited commercial e-mail and other forms of spam have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services, as well as being a financial burden on internet service providers [ref].
Additionally, Oxfam International argues that poor people are often excluded from globalization-induced opportunities by a lack of productive assets, weak infrastructure, poor education and ill-health; [ref] effectively leaving these marginalized groups in a poverty trap.	Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization.
If that problem is unresolved, global conflicts will result from opening Antarctica.	If that problem is unresolved, global conflicts will result from opening Antarctica.
Rural life is miserable and has higher mortality rates than cities	This planet does not find worse living standards anywhere than in the rural areas of developing countries.
Interpersonal communication has been a growing issue as more and more people have turned to social networking as a means of communication.	Individuals are given the power to post offensive remarks or pictures that could potentially cause a great amount of emotional pain for another individual.
When breakfast is served in the classroom, students can eat in a familiar, comfortable and convenient environment.	Some schools even installed vending machines that feature healthy breakfast choices on different floors and in various locations throughout the campus.
It states that, intentional euthanasia, whatever its forms or motives, is murder.	Among interpretations of the Koran and Hadith, the early termination of life is a crime, be it by suicide or helping one commit suicide.
Unlimited rural-urban migration erodes the economy of the cities, as shown in the previous argument, and limits their economic growth and available resources.	This leads to severe humanitarian problems such as malnutrition, thirst, lack of medication, etc.
They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals [ref].	He wrote that Singer's works, including Animal Liberation, contain little or no philosophical argument.
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism.	A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogeneous cities [ref].
The state does not tolerate serious crimes and has prospered despite the criticism it receives from humanitarian groups.	Singapore has some of the lowest crime rates in the world.
Additionally, children may not understand that they are being sold something, and are therefore more impressionable [ref].	Advertising regulation focuses heavily on the veracity of the claims and as such, there are often tighter restrictions placed around advertisements for food and healthcare products [ref].
Reality TV is vulgar and shoddy.	This is why many intelligent people find themselves gripped by Big Brother and other reality shows.
For most Chinese, especially those from less privileged backgrounds, a high score in the gaokao is their only means to significantly alter their fate.	In a very few instances ethnic minority students will need to sit the test in their own language on the 9th.
A benefit of asynchronous learning is the learner having more time to generate content-related responses to the instructor and peer postings; they have time to find facts to back their written statements [ref].	If platforms such as web conferencing or video chat are used, learners are able to hear the tone of voice used by others which may allow for greater understanding of content [ref].
While e-reader implementation in the classroom can be costly, it reduces how many books a student needs to carry.	E-books cost less than print books, reducing the overall cost of education.
Cloning humans would allow us to explore the potential benefits of modifying genes.	This method could help countries like Japan who are struggling with low birth rates.
Beggars on streets are not homeless, they're fraudsters, say police	Officers in Ely, Cambridgeshire, said those who claimed to be sleeping rough were actually fraudsters who were making substantial amounts of money.
Celebrities topped the list of those at high risk of drug addiction according to nearly 73 percent of the 2,031 respondents, and some 56 percent advocated harsher punishment like a ban on drug-addicted celebrities because of their impact on society, the survey shows.	The latest figures from the Office of China National Narcotics Control Commission show that by the end of June 2009, more than 1.2 million drug addicts had been registered in its database, with a growing number of people below 35 addicted to soft drugs.
Impact studies carried out or commissioned by host governments before the games often argue that hosting the event will provide a major economic lift by creating jobs, drawing tourists, and boosting overall economic output.	Boston’s National Bureau of Economic Research has published findings that hosting has a positive impact on a country’s international trade.
More comprehensive studies of neurologiocal function on larger samples performed by Johns Hopkins University in 1994 and accident rates analyzed by National Safety Council in 2017 show amateur boxing is a comparatively safe sport [ref].	Knocking a person unconscious or even causing a concussion may cause permanent brain damage [ref].
It is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God, his Creator.	The study also found that 45.8% of physicians agreed that physician-assisted suicide should be allowed in some cases; 40.7% did not, and the remaining 13.5% felt it depended [ref].
Federal courts have also recognized that curfew-imposed restrictions are a violation of First Amendment rights such as free speech and assembly, and therefore have struck down many curfews that fail to give free speech exemptions.	In fact, some studies do show that curfews can lead to a rise in crime.
Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.	Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.
In Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, the Court stressed the limited scope of Pierce, pointing out that it lent no support to the contention that parents may replace state educational requirements with their own idiosyncratic views of what knowledge a child needs to be a productive and happy member of society but rather held simply that while a State may posit [educational] standards, it may not pre-empt the educational process by requiring children to attend public schools.	The Court has ruled, however, that parents have a fundamental right to establish a home and bring up children along with the right to worship God according to the dictates of [their] own conscience [ref].
But extinctions are natural, as evidenced by countless species known only from fossils and museum specimens.	Protecting other land and aquatic animals and plants would cost much more.
When breakfast is served in the classroom, students can eat in a familiar, comfortable and convenient environment.	Teenagers, the group that skips breakfast more than any other, frequently get to school just before classes start.
Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact not about minorities but is about the proper terms of relationship between different cultural communities, which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., the principles of justice must not come from only one of the cultures but must come through an open and equal dialogue between them [ref].	Critics of multiculturalism often debate whether the multicultural ideal of benignly co-existing cultures that interrelate and influence one another, and yet remain distinct, is sustainable, paradoxical, or even desirable [ref].
According to an online Monday, June 3, 2013, news story, by William Harms, of the University of Chicago (UChicagoNews) in Chicago, Illinois, a study by social neuroscience expert and National Advisory Council on Aging member Dr. John Cacioppo (Tiffany and Robert Blake Distinguished Service Professor of Psychology; Director, Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience, Social Psychology Doctoral Program, and the Social Neuroscience Laboratory) showed that more than a third of marriages between 2005 and 2012 began online, and that they tend to have happier, longer marriages than offline couples (meeting through work, school, church and places of worship, social gatherings, and less successfully, at bars or through offline blind dating).	The results were published in the paper Marital Satisfaction and Breakups Differ Across Online and Offline Meeting Venues,” in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined.	He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust.
Wind farms tend to have much less impact on the environment than many other power stations.	Onshore wind farms are criticized for their impact on the landscape.
Intellectual property (IP) contributes enormously to our national and state economies.	However, competition law may further regulate this balance where the exploitation of intellectual property restricts competition in a way or to an extent that it is not justified for the protection of its specific subject-matter.
Additionally, children may not understand that they are being sold something, and are therefore more impressionable [ref].	While advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth [ref], it is not without social costs.
Supporters of mandatory gym programs contend that physical education classes have a wide range of benefits.	Supporters of mandatory gym programs contend that physical education classes have a wide range of benefits.
What we do know is that some of the animals on the verge of extinction harbor definitive medicinal resources.	For instance, freshwater mussels that filter water from the ocean are often the first to signal pollution issues, and the drop in population of peregrine falcons alerted the world to the dangers of DDT.
He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust.	She goes on to argue against the notion of special rights as she feels cultures are mutually constructive, and are shaped by the dominant culture.
Respect for animal welfare is often based on the belief that nonhuman animals are sentient and that consideration should be given to their well-being or suffering, especially when they are under the care of humans [ref].	These standards are under constant review and are debated, created and revised by animal welfare groups, legislators, and academics worldwide [ref].
Secondary benefits of breakfast clubs include improving attendance, helping to prevent disadvantaged children from experiencing social isolation, and helping with children who would otherwise not have adult supervision in the first hour or so before school.	It's 8 o'clock on a bright morning at the end of the summer term just gone and at Kingsmead primary school in Hackney the staff are preparing to perform one of their core tasks.
Wind farms can interfere with ground radar systems used for military, weather and air traffic control.	Utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy.
While people who are struggling financially need support, they are often too burdened by work, family, and other commitments to seek support.	“They all want to work, but many told me that they are nervous about working because they haven’t had a legitimate job, and they want to start working in a company that has a supportive environment, so they can be successful.”
Privacy on social networking sites can be undermined by many factors.	Women are less likely to publish information that reveals methods of contacting them.
Big data provides an infrastructure for transparency in the manufacturing industry, which is the ability to unravel uncertainties such as inconsistent component performance and availability.	Big data analytics has helped healthcare improve by providing personalized medicine and prescriptive analytics, clinical risk intervention and predictive analytics, waste and care variability reduction, automated external and internal reporting of patient data, standardized medical terms and patient registries and fragmented point solutions [ref].
Benefits of a notarized prenup a the start of your marriage	Though disagreements often arise, it still helps in making this transition more straightforward.
Rather than employing humans to work in shifts, they could simply invest in AI.	It also helps to make quick data-driven decisions, advance process effectiveness, minimize operational costs, facilitate product development, and enable extensive scalability [ref].
Gay rights groups have complained that certain websites that restrict their dating services to heterosexual couples are discriminating against homosexuals.	Dr. Cacioppo led a team that examined the results of a representative sample of 19,131 people who responded to a survey by Harris Interactive about their marriages and satisfaction.
There are different forms where user data in social networks are accessed and updated without a user's permission.	For instance, there is a study which suggests the children are not too far from inappropriate content on YouTube [ref].
Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.	In my view, this assessment results from too high an expectation of what should be achieved by patents or other intellectual property.
The sheer complexity of human value systems makes it very difficult to make AI's motivations human-friendly [ref].	An AGI need not be limited by human constraints on working memory, and might therefore be able to intuitively grasp more complex relationships than humans can[dubious – discuss].
Additionally, children may not understand that they are being sold something, and are therefore more impressionable [ref].	The general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'.
It would place at risk the livelihood and traditional culture of indigenous Arctic residents, already threatened by the worst climate change has wrought on the globe thus far.	The fossil fuel industry has received taxpayer handouts for decades and expanded offshore drilling would extend this dependency on raiding taxpayer pockets.
In Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, the Court stressed the limited scope of Pierce, pointing out that it lent no support to the contention that parents may replace state educational requirements with their own idiosyncratic views of what knowledge a child needs to be a productive and happy member of society but rather held simply that while a State may posit [educational] standards, it may not pre-empt the educational process by requiring children to attend public schools.	Every state has some form of a compulsory attendance law that requires children in a certain age range to spend a specific amount of time being educated [ref].
They involve extreme competition which drains children; it takes away their innocence.	These competitions are different from reality shows as they are not held for commercial reasons.
Servicing the debt that is left over after hosting the games can burden public budgets for decades.	But while some in Sochi see the unused stadiums and overbuilt facilities as a waste, other residents argue that the games spurred spending on roads, water systems, and other public goods that wouldn’t have otherwise happened.
The conservation of endangered species is important for humans as well.	Although there are so many endangered species across the globe, there are also incredible efforts underway to save many of them.
However, the policy has come under criticism that it has resulted in the abuse of women.	Beginning in 1979 and being officially phased out in 2015 [ref], the policy was instated to control the rapid population growth that was occurring in the nation at that time.
Evangelical Christianity [ref], Catholicism [ref], Mormonism [ref], Orthodox Judaism [ref], and Islam [ref], hold the view that homosexual sex is a sin and that its practice and acceptance in society weakens moral standards.	Many forms of religions, including the Eastern faiths and Abrahamic faiths, do not support homosexual sex.
Bullfighting promotes violence, torture and cruelty to animals for no reason, William Soberon, of the Anti-Bullfighting Front of Peru, told La Republica.	First Catalonia outlawed bullfighting, which the Economist likened it to a German state banning wurst or a French region condemning berets.
Economists say the games’ so-called implicit costs must also be considered.	As the costs of hosting have skyrocketed, revenues cover only a fraction of expenditures.
If then such distances are local, products which reach the consumer will bear excellent quality since they have not travelled for long distances.	Customer care plays an important role in ensuring the end users of a product get any information about the product at any time and upon request.
Scruton therefore regards the emergence of the animal rights movement as the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview, because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he argues, distinctive to the human condition, and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species [ref].	Every legal privilege, he writes, imposes a burden on the one who does not possess that privilege: that is, your right may be my duty.
In other words, if we choose to defend our personal privacy, then we will oppose the promotion of the real-name system.	For centuries, if the development of the Internet is the choice of the times and the only way to develop, then we must first ensure that the process of users using the Internet is safe and respected.
The last negative impact that online purchases have on the local economy is to take money out of that economy.	In addition, when customers are pinching pennies or making many purchases, such as during the holidays, sales tax savings can be important to them.
The study, based on information from 37,000 high school students’ responses to surveys from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reveals that most students do not believe gym class is effective.	Unfortunately, while many states have increased the time students spend in gym class, Cornell's study found that adding 200 more minutes of time to gym class each week did not produce substantial changes.
Politics is no place for a women consequently the privilege should not be granted to her.	The men are able to run the government and take care of the women.
A new study has found that in at least 10 different countries, kids hate the way they’re being taught about sex in school.	The sex curriculum was developed during former premier Kathleen Wynne’s years, and the consultation with parents was minimal.
If then such distances are local, products which reach the consumer will bear excellent quality since they have not travelled for long distances.	As already stated that local manufacturing and consuming does not require lengthy transport of goods, it becomes obvious that wear and tear is reduced considerably.
Such tests are often thought of as fairer and more objective than a system in which some students get an easier test and others get a more difficult test.	That perception, which may or may not be accurate, depends entirely on the purpose for the test.
By adopting a stern measure like embracing protectionism, a country can be shielded from outside competition and hence local market will grow.	Such measures must comprise the government, the entrepreneur and ordinary man as each has a role to play.
A problematic component of online dating is the ease of lying it allows for, due to the anonymity of the internet.	(emphasis in original) Instead it creates an incentive to show profiles of lapsed and non-paying members (described as ghosts in the analysis) in the hope that site visitors will wish to contact these profiles and will subscribe to do so, or that once contacted by new or existing users some of these ghosts will wish to respond and will re-subscribe in order to do so.
Strong and Enforced Intellectual Property Rights Protect Consumers and Families	These industries also have 72.5% higher output per worker than the national average, valued at $136,556 per worker.
Among interpretations of the Koran and Hadith, the early termination of life is a crime, be it by suicide or helping one commit suicide.	The Roman Catholic Church condemns euthanasia and assisted suicide as morally wrong.
In addition there is an abundance of evidence to sustain the conclusion that indulgence in acts of sex perversion weakens the moral fiber of an individual to a degree that he is not suitable for a position of responsibility [ref].	McCarthy and Roy Cohn more often used the secrets of closeted gay American politicians as tools for blackmail than did foreign powers [ref].
Controlling birth rates allows families to raise the future earnings power of the next generation.	High fertility countries have 18% of the world's population but contribute 38% of the population growth [ref].
Alternative energy emerged as a hot topic, and, given the rapid acceleration of technological advancement, the necessity of exploiting Antarctica is doubtful.	With all the reasons above, the argument does not address any relevant point regarding the motion.
As for technologies DESALINATION which is much more feasible and has almost infinite resource in the form of ocean and RAINWATER HARVESTING which is also much more feasible—with actual application in Singapore, Japan, Germany etc.—and eco-friendly are better alternatives than exploiting Antarctica.	The Prop keeps hammering on is the ongoing energy crisis, yet it does not show logical steps so as to argue inevitability.
Wind turbines also generate noise, and at a residential distance of 300 metres (980 ft) this may be around 45 dB; however, at a distance of 1.5 km (1 mi), most wind turbines become inaudible [ref].	However, when improperly sited, data from the monitoring of two groups of growing geese revealed substantially lower body weights and higher concentrations of a stress hormone in the blood of the first group of geese who were situated 50 meters away compared to a second group which was at a distance of 500 meters from the turbine [ref].
Critics have linked wind farms to adverse health effects (see wind turbine syndrome).	Typically they also need to be built in wild and rural areas, which can lead to industrialization of the countryside [ref] and habitat loss [ref].
Wind farms tend to have much less impact on the environment than many other power stations.	A wind farm or wind park, also called a wind power station or wind power plant [ref], is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electricity.
In a healthy economic system, demand and supply must coexist for growth to occur; otherwise the economy collapses.	Environmental stimuli must be satisfied by economic, technological, political, cultural, natural and demographical ideals.
As the war progressed the military leaders began to see the substantial impact the women could make.	An officer of the CWAC had to write to her superiors regarding whether or not a girl of Indian nationality would be objected to for enlistment.
Their rationale is that homosexuality is immoral, and that Scouts are expected to have certain moral standards and values, as the Scout Oath and Scout Law requires boys to be morally straight [ref].	Parts of this article (those related to Boy Scouts of America) need to be updated.
The contact hypothesis in sociology is a well documented phenomenon in which cooperative interactions with those from a different group than one's own reduce prejudice and inter-group hostility.	Tariq Modood argues that in the early years of the 21st century, multiculturalism is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less, since it is the form of integration that (1) best fits the ideal of egalitarianism, (2) has the best chance of succeeding in the post-9/11, post 7/7 world, and (3) has remained moderate [and] pragmatic [ref].
The preservation of our nation’s biological diversity is an immensely important facet to the survival of the travel industry.	The American tourism industry is dependent on plant and animal species and their ecosystems for their multi-billion dollar, job-intensive industry.
It is argued that nation states, who would previously have been synonymous with a distinctive cultural identity of their own, lose out to enforced multiculturalism and that this ultimately erodes the host nations' distinct culture [ref].	A 2018 study in the American Political Science Review cast doubts on findings that ethnoracial homogeneity led to greater public goods provision [ref].
The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	It is worrying when parents are told that school-based programmes in other countries have led to an enormous increase in premarital sex, teen promiscuity and teenage pregnancy.
Intellectual Property Drives Economic Growth and Competitiveness	Jobs in IP-intensive industries are expected to grow faster over the next decade than the national average.
The intermittent nature of wind power can pose complications for maintaining a stable power grid when wind farms provide a large percentage of electricity in any one region [ref].	Wind farms can interfere with ground radar systems used for military, weather and air traffic control.
The Court has ruled, however, that parents have a fundamental right to establish a home and bring up children along with the right to worship God according to the dictates of [their] own conscience [ref].	In Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, the Court applied the doctrine of Meyer v. Nebraska, id., at 534, to hold unconstitutional an Oregon law requiring the parent, guardian, or other person having custody of a child between 8 and 16 years of age [427 U.S. 160, 177] to send that child to public school on pain of criminal liability.
The majority of parents in American believe that sexual education is valuable.	With this much cash being put into the “abstinence only until marriage” sexual education, you would think that the results would be promising.
Respect for animal welfare is often based on the belief that nonhuman animals are sentient and that consideration should be given to their well-being or suffering, especially when they are under the care of humans [ref].	The other view is based on the animal rights position that animals should not be regarded as property and any use of animals by humans is unacceptable.
Because everyone gets the same test and the same grading system, standardized tests are often perceived as being fairer than non-standardized test.	Standardized tests do not need to be high-stakes tests, time-limited tests, or multiple-choice tests.
Euthanasia is a complex issue in Islamic theology; however, in general it is considered contrary to Islamic law and holy texts.	Among Protestant denominations, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution in 1991 opposing euthanasia and assisted suicide stating that it is morally wrong and unacceptable to take a human life to relieve the suffering caused by incurable illnesses [ref].
In other words, if we choose to defend our personal privacy, then we will oppose the promotion of the real-name system.	And for the public, it is difficult to see the true and false of the account, these accounts are the same as the human account.
Because curfews increase the likelihood of young people being drawn into the criminal justice system, criminal justice reformers have begun to speak out against the “curfew-to-prison pipeline.” And the penalties for breaking curfew are not trivial.	Along with First Amendment rights, curfews violate fair and equal treatment under the law as well as substantive and procedural due process, making them unconstitutional in other ways as well.
These testing disparities do not represent students’ potential to learn and achieve.	Even if standardized tests perfectly predicted achievement, they would be doing so on the basis of accumulated resources that have helped children from privileged backgrounds to reach the levels of success that they have by the time they take the test.
Federal courts have also recognized that curfew-imposed restrictions are a violation of First Amendment rights such as free speech and assembly, and therefore have struck down many curfews that fail to give free speech exemptions.	Curfew violations are a type of status offense, which means they criminalize behavior that is only illegal because the person involved is under eighteen.
Crime, prostitution, drug abuse and street children are all negative effects of urbanisation.	The increase in urban demand, combined with a loss of agricultural land, means more pressure on rural people to produce food for the growing number of urban people.
A shortage of male recruits forced the military to establish female branches in 1941 and 1942.	The proportion of women in the services was initially limited to four percent of their strength, though this was ignored by the RAAF [ref].
Economists say the games’ so-called implicit costs must also be considered.	Operational costs make up a smaller but still significant chunk of hosts’ Olympics budget.
Many of those who move to cities find themselves in a worse situation but have lost any moving power they originally had and are thus trapped.	These are protected by various charters and are considered inseparable from the human being.
Cloning humans could help us find new ways to recover from trauma.	It is also notable to point out that several countries have formally banned this practice, and many more have passed laws that prohibit human reproductive cloning.
The first basic principle under the urge to buy locally is that money stays in the same country.	The various advantages of buying locally are thus explained as follows and with examples.
The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined.	The belief behind this backlash on multiculturalism is that it creates friction within society [ref].
It could help couples resolve problems with fertility.	It is also notable to point out that several countries have formally banned this practice, and many more have passed laws that prohibit human reproductive cloning.
The diversity comes from interacting with students outside of one's geographical location, possibly offering a variety of perspectives on course content [ref].	In 1993 with the debut of the first Internet web browser, created by the University of Illinois, online learning began to flourish [ref].
On the other hand, one of the main limitations of this delivery method is the greater potential for a learner to feel removed from the learning environment.	A benefit of asynchronous learning is the learner having more time to generate content-related responses to the instructor and peer postings; they have time to find facts to back their written statements [ref].
Cloning humans could help us find new ways to recover from trauma.	Some of them take an approach that suggests it’s a way to save the world, like in The Fifth Element, when Leeloo is a clone of what must be combined with four other elements to save the world.
Big data very often means 'dirty data' and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth.	This includes electronic health record data, imaging data, patient generated data, sensor data, and other forms of difficult to process data.
The difficulty for many parents who agree is that they feel teachers are better equipped to deal with the dramatic changes in sexual knowledge that have occurred among children of all ages.	Studies show that people who have problems with self-esteem bring these difficulties into their couple relationship.
Online bullying, also called cyberbullying, is a relatively common occurrence and it can often result in emotional trauma for the victim.	Many parents of teenage girls worry about their safety online because of the many manipulations there are online and on social networking sites [ref].
By doing this, they're challenging schools to increase the performance and productivity of their students.	In fact, research reflects that students who eat breakfast each day, on average, score more than 17 percent higher on math tests and are 20 percent more likely to graduate than students who don’t eat breakfast at all.
Also, incorporating team projects can help alleviate feelings of isolation [ref].. Video and audio components enhance connection and communication with peers, as this supports learners to expand on their responses and engage in discussions [28].	In addition to preparation, faculty experienced in online instruction spend about 30% more time on courses conducted online [ref].
In addition there is an abundance of evidence to sustain the conclusion that indulgence in acts of sex perversion weakens the moral fiber of an individual to a degree that he is not suitable for a position of responsibility [ref].	Bryant's campaign attracted widespread opposition and boycotts which put her out of business and destroyed her reputation.
The intermittent nature of wind power can pose complications for maintaining a stable power grid when wind farms provide a large percentage of electricity in any one region [ref].	The level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar, the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines/aircraft with respect to the radar.
While e-reader implementation in the classroom can be costly, it reduces how many books a student needs to carry.	These simulations can be used for sciences to better explain anatomy, physics and engineering concepts in ways that students can observe and interact with.
Rapid population increases and unplanned growth create an urban sprawl with negative economic, social, and environmental consequences.	Slums are urban areas that are heavily populated and have sub-standard housing with very poor living conditions, creating several problems.
Biological diversity has been vital to the development of all types of medicine.	The biochemistry of unexamined species is an unfathomed reservoir of new and potentially more effective substances.
Risk for child safety	There are different forms where user data in social networks are accessed and updated without a user's permission.
In our local context, there are concerns that the abolition of the death penalty may send the wrong signal that such crimes are not taken seriously enough.	Amnesty International, lawyers, politicians and humanitarian groups who are for the abolishment of the death penalty for serious offences should rethink their stand and consider the well-being and rights of those who have become victims, as well as the rights of others who wish to live in peace.
The first basic principle under the urge to buy locally is that money stays in the same country.	Had the money been used and went in to another country, a vacuum ensues which to fill it will take the citizens producing more or seeking buyers from outside the country (Cato 99).
It would place at risk the livelihood and traditional culture of indigenous Arctic residents, already threatened by the worst climate change has wrought on the globe thus far.	That means supporting more renewable sources, like wind and solar power that provide grow the economy while cutting pollution.
In fact, some studies do show that curfews can lead to a rise in crime.	Juvenile curfews don’t target populations that commit the most crime and waste police resources.
A new study from the National Association for College Admission Counseling provides evidence that test-optional policies ― a variety of policies that allow students not to submit scores on standardized tests like the SAT or GRE during the admissions process ― can help colleges improve their diversity without sacrificing academic quality.	The use of standardized tests in admissions disproportionately exclude people of color and other marginalized groups.
Economists say the games’ so-called implicit costs must also be considered.	What’s more, much of the revenue doesn’t go to the host—the IOC keeps more than half of all television revenue, typically the single largest chunk of money generated by the games.
The fierce competition and emphasis on test scores have been criticised for putting students and even their teachers and parents under unnecessary stress, and denying teenagers of getting a well-rounded education.	There have also been protests by local parents in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Hubei against the Ministry of Education’s scheme to allocate local enrolment quota to western provinces to promote education fairness.
Vaccines are among the most effective prevention tools available to clinicians.	However, the success of an immunization program depends on high rates of acceptance and coverage.
Physical inactivity as a child could result in physical inactivity as an adult.	Researchers studied 16 men over a 14-day period and fed them 50% more of their energy required every day through fats and carbohydrates.
The Internet has also gone a step further than television in eroding the advertising income of newspapers, as — unlike broadcast media — it proves a convenient vehicle for classified advertising, particularly in categories such as jobs, vehicles, and real estate.	In recent years newspaper’s weekday circulation fell 7% and Sunday circulation fell 4%, both showing their greatest declines since 2010.
Juvenile curfews don’t target populations that commit the most crime and waste police resources.	Federal courts have also recognized that curfew-imposed restrictions are a violation of First Amendment rights such as free speech and assembly, and therefore have struck down many curfews that fail to give free speech exemptions.
By using the wide range of technology available in most classrooms, students have access to more information and tools than ever before.	By using the wide range of technology available in most classrooms, students have access to more information and tools than ever before.
A celebrity committing a crime compared to a non - celebrity is a greater wrong because their doings impact the people who follow them.	For people to be aware of this celebrities need to be punished more, because most of the time they get away with it.
They teach us something about human nature and so broaden our experience.	By creating pseudo-celebrities it contributes to the debasement of popular taste.
Restrictions would benefit rural areas	Myths can be easily propagated by a single successful migrant returning home to visit that then attracts many others to try their luck without any knowledge of the possible costs [ref].
If that problem is unresolved, global conflicts will result from opening Antarctica.	The UN—by far the most powerful international organization—is controlled by winners of WWII: one only has to count members of the Security Council to find that out.
Scruton therefore regards the emergence of the animal rights movement as the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview, because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he argues, distinctive to the human condition, and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species [ref].	Scruton singled out Peter Singer, a prominent Australian philosopher and animal-rights activist, for criticism.
The study, based on information from 37,000 high school students’ responses to surveys from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reveals that most students do not believe gym class is effective.	Middle school and high school students should get 45 minutes of exercise a day.
Lastly, we should never forget that gamblers deserve all thebenefits that other consumers of entertainment servicesenjoy--including the benefits of competition.	I have set forth a number of reasons why attempts to prohibitInternet gambling will inevitably fail and give way tolegalization.
Freedom of movement is an intrinsic human right	What will happen instead, will be a state of confusion, where the law will be upheld in some parts while ignored in others.
Expectations of learners to be self-motivated, able to manage their time effectively, contribute to course discussions and have a willingness to teach others is not unlike what is expected in a traditional classroom.	Initial preparation of an online course is often more time-consuming than preparation for the classroom.
However, the policy has come under criticism that it has resulted in the abuse of women.	However, the policy has come under criticism that it has resulted in the abuse of women.
Dr. Meyers adds that smoking remains the leading preventable risk factor for heart attack.	The impact of bans was strengthened if compliance was good, if baseline smoking prevalence was low and if air quality was good.
Officers in Ely, Cambridgeshire, said those who claimed to be sleeping rough were actually fraudsters who were making substantial amounts of money.	The force said after carrying out extensive work with beggars in the city, officers were confident there were no homeless people on the streets.
Given the improvements in delivery methods, online learning environments provide a greater degree of flexibility than traditional classroom settings [ref].	On the other hand, one of the main limitations of this delivery method is the greater potential for a learner to feel removed from the learning environment.
Additionally, Oxfam International argues that poor people are often excluded from globalization-induced opportunities by a lack of productive assets, weak infrastructure, poor education and ill-health; [ref] effectively leaving these marginalized groups in a poverty trap.	The flow of migrants to advanced economies has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge.
In a healthy economic system, demand and supply must coexist for growth to occur; otherwise the economy collapses.	They therefore ensure that every concept is satisfying to them in terms of quality, price, availability, place, position, and promotion of goods and services.
Mr. Jotwani, though, contended that reality shows have the power to burst stereotypes as well as reinforce them, citing Susan Boyle, the homely singer who became a star after a performance on “Britain’s Got Talent.” “That’s something that only happens on reality TV,” he said.	He also noted that despite the genre’s name, they are actually anti-reality; those on the shows and those who aspire to be on them adopt made-for-the-camera mannerisms and mind-sets.
Increased enforcement of the laws often resulted in increased opposition to vaccination.	By the beginning of the 1980s, all 50 states had school immunization requirements.
Although it can be considered relatively harmless and many parents enjoy watching such shows together with their kids, there may be negative psychological effects here as well.	However, teenagers may see it as real, adopting and reproducing these behavioral patterns in real life.
As reported in USA Today, what would benefit children more is periods of rigorous physical activity that makes them break a sweat.	Attempting to explain these disappointing results, Cornell's lead professor of policy analysis and management asserts, “The rest of the extra gym time is likely spent being sedentary — most likely standing around idly while playing sports like softball or volleyball that don’t require constant movement.” Cornell’s results hit a familiar nerve, as a study of fitness classes in Texas elementary schools also found that the majority of students spent the class time inactive; specifically, the data suggested that students were only engaging in exercise or movement for approximately 3 minutes during the entire class period.
Social networking sites have created issues among getting hired for jobs and losing jobs because of exposing inappropriate content, posting photos of embarrassing situations or posting comments that contain potentially offensive comments (e.g., racist, homophobic or defamatory comments), or even political comments that are contrary to those of the employer.	Not only have employees lost their jobs in the United States, but it has happened with social network users internationally.
Physical inactivity as a child could result in physical inactivity as an adult.	At home, parents can help prevent their children from becoming overweight by changing the way the family eats and exercises together.
While Western subsidies and tax breaks were initiated to benefit the environment and to help reduce the West's dependence on foreign fossil fuels, they have been a boon for ailing farming sectors around the world.	Food crops - sugar, beets, rapeseed and soy - will fall into a second category, in which producers will have to prove that their biofuel is environmentally beneficial, on numerous levels, through the entire life cycle of production.
Standardized tests put large amounts of pressure on students.	While the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) has served as an educational barometer for some thirty years by administering standardized tests on a regular basis to random schools throughout the United States, efforts over the last decade at the state and federal levels have mandated annual standardized test administration for all public schools across the country [ref].
Alternative energy emerged as a hot topic, and, given the rapid acceleration of technological advancement, the necessity of exploiting Antarctica is doubtful.	The PRIMARY reason for lack of fresh water is underdeveloped aqua-infrastructure.
Physical inactivity of children has also shown to be a serious cause, and children who fail to engage in regular physical activity are at greater risk of obesity.	Physical inactivity as a child could result in physical inactivity as an adult.
In particular, reality television often shows excessive amounts of aggression; this is needed mostly to keep the audience “on their toes,” making them guess about the outcomes of numerous fomented interpersonal conflicts.	A series of documentaries depicting mundane and sometimes dramatic events in the lives of a regular Californian family captivated the minds and hearts of millions of Americans, paving the way for hundreds of the show’s ideological successors.
Additionally, Oxfam International argues that poor people are often excluded from globalization-induced opportunities by a lack of productive assets, weak infrastructure, poor education and ill-health; [ref] effectively leaving these marginalized groups in a poverty trap.	Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality.

Intellectual Property Drives Economic Growth and Competitiveness	We believe IP rights are worth protecting, both domestically and abroad.
Reality shows, on the other hand, are not real, they are created keeping in mind the target audience.	Under normal circumstances, a child of this age won’t do or speak these things.
A 2016 study by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that GM foods are safe for human consumption and they could find no conclusive evidence that they harm the environment nor wildlife [ref].	According to Marc Brazeau, an association between professional conflict of interest and positive study outcomes can be skewed because companies typically contract with independent researchers to perform follow-up studies only after in-house research uncovers favorable results.
Intellectual Property Rights Encourage Innovation and Reward Entrepreneurs	Bringing all of these important and diverse points together is the fact that protecting IP is a non-partisan issue that is shared by a broad coalition of interests.
Intellectual Property Rights Encourage Innovation and Reward Entrepreneurs	American’s Founding Fathers so recognized the importance of innovation and ensured that strong IP rights for authors and inventors are protected in the U.S. Constitution, thus making America the world’s entrepreneural leader— a fact borne out by the overwhelming number of patents, copyrights and trademarks filed by the U.S. annually.

So yes, they are very similar in terms of the active ingredient.	The Food and Drug Administration has very strict criteria so over-the-counter store brands must achieve very similar blood concentrations as name brands.
Respect for animal welfare is often based on the belief that nonhuman animals are sentient and that consideration should be given to their well-being or suffering, especially when they are under the care of humans [ref].	There are two forms of criticism of the concept of animal welfare, coming from diametrically opposite positions.
They are purely discriminatory and create criminals out of otherwise law-abiding citizens.	In fact, some studies do show that curfews can lead to a rise in crime.
The additional time provides an opportunity to increase the learner's ability to process information [ref].	On the other hand, one of the main limitations of this delivery method is the greater potential for a learner to feel removed from the learning environment.
Donor children missing parental information often battle troubling emotions such as confusion and isolation on a more acute level than those adopted.	Here, potential donors, holding screen names such as RealMan and tadpolesready, offer their unscreened sperm for free.
While people who are struggling financially need support, they are often too burdened by work, family, and other commitments to seek support.	The environmental and cost-saving benefits of this movement, however, has largely left low-income communities behind, though these communities stand to gain the most.
Standardized testing is considered important and these tests do assess what is taught on the national level.	There are three primary reasons for Standardized tests: Comparing among test takers, Improvement of ongoing instruction and learning, and Evaluation of instruction [ref].
In particular, reality television often shows excessive amounts of aggression; this is needed mostly to keep the audience “on their toes,” making them guess about the outcomes of numerous fomented interpersonal conflicts.	And, considering how much time a regular American teenager spends watching television, this fact is alarming.
The global moratorium on the trade of ivory in 1989 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was supposed to protect elephants from further devastation, after their numbers in Africa were reduced from five million in the 1930s to just 690,000 in the 1980s.

While online dating sites allows members to search on attributes such as education and income, virtual dating allows users to explore compatibility, sense of humor and rapport.	Online daters may have more liberal social attitudes compared to the general population in the United States.
There are different forms where user data in social networks are accessed and updated without a user's permission.	According to the article, High Tech or High Risks: Moral Panics About Girls Online, it suggests that young girls are more at risks because they are often represented through products of play in transgressive poses because they often manipulate other users online by making themselves look older than what they actually appear which can attract sexual predators.
Because everyone gets the same test and the same grading system, standardized tests are often perceived as being fairer than non-standardized test.	They are used to measure objectives and how schools are meeting educational state standards.
In 2007, one study of amateur boxers showed that protective headgear did not prevent brain damage [ref], and another found that amateur boxers faced a high risk of brain damage [ref].	Professional boxing is forbidden in Iceland [ref], Iran, Saudi Arabia and North Korea.
A celebrity committing a crime compared to a non - celebrity is a greater wrong because their doings impact the people who follow them.	Celebrities should receive harsher punishments because their actions and attitudes are looked up to.
Social issues: One of the most positive effects of the reality TV shows is that they address numerous social issues and introduce people to the ills plaguing the society.	Although channels became more interesting to watch, the reality TV shows have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Studies have been done in how physical education can help improve academic achievement.	In 1975, the United States House of Representatives voted to require school physical education classes include both genders [ref].
The Roman Catholic Church condemns euthanasia and assisted suicide as morally wrong.	A 2010 survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians found that 16.3% of physicians would consider halting life-sustaining therapy because the family demanded it, even if they believed that it was premature.
He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust.	A prominent criticism in the US, later echoed in Europe, Canada and Australia, was that multiculturalism undermined national unity, hindered social integration and cultural assimilation, and led to the fragmentation of society into several ethnic factions (Balkanization) [ref].
The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined.	In an article in the Hudson Review, Bruce Bawer writes about what he sees as a developing distaste toward the idea and policies of multiculturalism in Europe, especially in the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Austria and Germany.
He asserted that his extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society [ref].

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality.	An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise [ref].
Standardized testing is considered important and these tests do assess what is taught on the national level.	Furthermore, student's success is being tracked to a teacher's relative performance, making teacher advancement contingent upon a teacher's success with a student's academic performance.
Police in one of England's smallest cities have urged people not to give beggars their money, insisting none of them are genuinely homeless.	The force said after carrying out extensive work with beggars in the city, officers were confident there were no homeless people on the streets.
Surrogacy is a wonderful option for same-sex parents who are ready to expand their families.	Parenting is full of infinite joys and challenges, but one challenge that especially impacts same-sex parents is the possibility of discrimination.
The diversity comes from interacting with students outside of one's geographical location, possibly offering a variety of perspectives on course content [ref].	The spelling and grammar within postings of an asynchronous environment are like that found in formal academic writing [ref].
The Internet puts the sum of human knowledge just a click away -- it's added a lot of tools for students to research information and learn more about the topics that interest them.	As Sarah Kessler of Mashable says, Digital simulations and models can help teachers explain concepts that are too big or too small ... to demonstrate in a physical classroom.
Among interpretations of the Koran and Hadith, the early termination of life is a crime, be it by suicide or helping one commit suicide.	The various positions on the cessation of medical treatment are mixed and considered a different class of action than direct termination of life, especially if the patient is suffering.

Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality.	Both intellectual property and competition law enable economic operators to profit by doing better than other economic operators and thereby encourage them to strive to do so, that is to compete.
The largest Christian body, the Catholic Church, condemns homosexual acts as gravely sinful and intrinsically disordered.	It formerly carried the death penalty in Afghanistan under the Taliban [ref].
Standardized testing is considered important and these tests do assess what is taught on the national level.	Proponents argue that the data generated by the standardized tests act like a report card for the community, demonstrating how well local schools are performing.
The Court has ruled, however, that parents have a fundamental right to establish a home and bring up children along with the right to worship God according to the dictates of [their] own conscience [ref].	In 2008, a three-judge panel of the California Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that children must be taught by a credentialed tutor or person with a teaching credential.
As these technologies become cheaper and more accessible, they will be implemented more widely, and humans might be increasingly replaced by AI [ref].	The machine-vision tools use a machine-learning algorithm tested on small volumes of sample images.
Breakfast clubs can be especially valuable for children whose parents are not able to afford to provide them with regular morning meals.	She knows that without their daily breakfast club, dozens of the children in her inner city school would be coming to school hungry.
But if these goods and services are not consumed, it will not make sense why they were being produced.	They therefore ensure that every concept is satisfying to them in terms of quality, price, availability, place, position, and promotion of goods and services.

Expectations of learners to be self-motivated, able to manage their time effectively, contribute to course discussions and have a willingness to teach others is not unlike what is expected in a traditional classroom.	With the potential for learners to feel disconnected from peers within the course, the instructor will need to work to create spaces and encounters which promote socialization.
A new study has found that in at least 10 different countries, kids hate the way they’re being taught about sex in school.	The responsibility of parenting cannot be placed on other people’s shoulders.
Additionally, children may not understand that they are being sold something, and are therefore more impressionable [ref].	Advertising is increasingly invading public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation [ref].
When ecosystems fail, our own health is at risk.	This balance is difficult to maintain: the loss of one species often triggers the loss of others.
Celebrities topped the list of those at high risk of drug addiction according to nearly 73 percent of the 2,031 respondents, and some 56 percent advocated harsher punishment like a ban on drug-addicted celebrities because of their impact on society, the survey shows.	Looking back on a series of celebrities' drug scandals, soft drugs like ice, a popular name for crystal methamphetamine, and ecstasy, a popular name of MDMA, are frequently mentioned.
On the other hand, one of the main limitations of this delivery method is the greater potential for a learner to feel removed from the learning environment.	Asynchronous learning environments are described as online spaces where work is supported through the use of digital platforms in such a way that participants are not required to be online at the same time [ref].
A student's education may be customized to support his or her learning level, style, and interests [ref].	It is not uncommon for a student to experience more than one approach as the family discovers what works best for their student.

Posner calls his approach soft utilitarianism, in contrast to Singer's hard utilitarianism.
This path to parenthood allows members of the LGBT community to fulfill their parenting dreams while maintaining a genetic link to their children.	Children often grow curious about where they came from as they get older, and explaining surrogacy to a young child can be challenging.
In Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, the Court stressed the limited scope of Pierce, pointing out that it lent no support to the contention that parents may replace state educational requirements with their own idiosyncratic views of what knowledge a child needs to be a productive and happy member of society but rather held simply that while a State may posit [educational] standards, it may not pre-empt the educational process by requiring children to attend public schools.	The Court has repeatedly stressed that while parents have a constitutional right to send their children to private schools and a constitutional right to select private schools that offer specialized instruction, they have no constitutional right to provide their children with private school education unfettered by reasonable government regulation...Indeed, the Court in Pierce expressly acknowledged the power of the State reasonably to regulate all schools, to inspect, supervise and examine them, their teachers and pupils [ref]...
The subsidy cuts are a response to increasing scientific evidence that the total emissions and environmental damage caused during the manufacturing of many clean biofuels often outweighs their lower emissions output, compared with the output of fossil fuels.	Governments in Europe and elsewhere have begun rolling back generous, across-the-board subsidies for biofuels, acknowledging that the environmental benefits of these green fuels have often been exaggerated.
Biological diversity has been vital to the development of all types of medicine.	The importance of saving endangered species has been all over the news in recent years.
With computers students can be involved in more detailed and in-depth simulations than in years past.	However, videoconferencing removes the variables of travel and reduces issues with scheduling, and it increases student participation by reducing the size of the audience.

In our age of online DNA testing and family matching sites, donors have no guarantee of anonymity anyway.	Even if the donors don’t register their DNA online, any one of their family members might.
Rather, it was found that promoting diversity actually helps in advancing disadvantaged students [ref].	Sarah Song views cultures as historically shaped entities by its members, and that they lack boundaries due to globalization, thereby making them stronger than what others may assume[47].
We buy foreign branded products also because of the exclusivity of certain products.	The process of buying for the South African consumer is highly influenced by other consumers, their relatives and friends.
Cost of the shows: Creating reality TV shows is not an expensive proposition and brings more bucks for money in comparison to the sitcoms and the soap operas.	Some of the shows where contestants participate to win prizes show them in poor light as they use meanness and greed to outdo each other.
The study, based on information from 37,000 high school students’ responses to surveys from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reveals that most students do not believe gym class is effective.	And about half of that time should be spent in activities like those mentioned above that get the heart racing.

Parents' right to homeschool their children has clearly been established through subsequent court decisions to such an extent that any statute attempting to forbid it entirely would certainly be struck down on constitutional or other grounds.
It states that, intentional euthanasia, whatever its forms or motives, is murder.	30% of those who admitted to it also believed that euthanasia is unethical [ref].
Juvenile curfews don’t target populations that commit the most crime and waste police resources.	Status offenses unfairly punish young people for activity that is not considered dangerous to society (otherwise it would be illegal for everyone to do it).
Children's rights should only extend to access to the donor's medical history (including physical and psychological ailments).	I would like to know my father, though that likely will never happen.
Many women wanted to play an active role, and hundreds of voluntary women's auxiliary and paramilitary organisations had been formed by 1940.	In October 1938, the Women's Volunteer Service was established in Victoria, British Columbia.
These two factors combined generate an explosive mixture, adding up to regular teenage hormonal storms: needless to say, it can make unpredictable adolescent behaviors even more rebellious.	This is mostly true for all kinds of talent shows focusing on children’s extraordinary talents or abilities.
Both intellectual property and competition law enable economic operators to profit by doing better than other economic operators and thereby encourage them to strive to do so, that is to compete.	We should look elsewhere, or wait a little longer, if greater innovation, quality and efficiency are not in fact achieved.
In the UK, breakfast clubs were introduced in the 1990s, driven not just by concern for children's nutrition but by parental demand for a supervised place to leave their children in the early morning.	Schools themselves are the most common location for breakfast clubs, but they can also be found in churches, community halls or even commercial premises.
Harmful effect on teen: The new generation of reality TV celebrity stars does not thrive on talent but use sensationalism to always be in the news.	With active discussion on the TV forums, the reality shows have made people more aware of what is happening in their vicinity.

Families created through surrogacy may face the additional challenge of talking about their child’s birth story.	If you or your partner are HIV-positive, talk to your surrogacy professional for more information about your surrogacy options.
Highly capable and autonomous planning systems require additional checks because of their potential to generate plans that treat humans adversarially, as competitors for limited resources [ref].	Building in safeguards will not be easy; one can certainly say in English, we want you to design this power plant in a reasonable, common-sense way, and not build in any dangerous covert subsystems, but it's not currently clear how one would actually rigorously specify this goal in machine code [ref].
The vegetation clearing and ground disturbance required for wind farms are minimal compared with coal mines and coal-fired power stations.	Wind-energy advocates contend that less than 1% of the land is used for foundations and access roads, the other 99% can still be used for farming [ref].

They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over the world; perhaps instead artificial intelligence will naturally develop along female lines: fully capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents or dominate the civilization [ref].	One argument for the orthogonality thesis is that some AI designs appear to have orthogonality built into them; in such a design, changing a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally unfriendly AI can be as simple as prepending a minus (-) sign onto its utility function.
Juvenile curfews are often applied in a discriminatory fashion.	They are purely discriminatory and create criminals out of otherwise law-abiding citizens.
Risk for child safety	In May 2010, a child pornography social networking site with hundreds of members was dismantled by law enforcement.
Woman suffrage has been proven a failure in states that have tried it.	To man, woman is the dearest creature on earth, and there is no extreme to which he would not go for his mother or sister.
The contact hypothesis in sociology is a well documented phenomenon in which cooperative interactions with those from a different group than one's own reduce prejudice and inter-group hostility.	They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes.
When saving endangered species, we are ultimately saving ourselves.	Governments, nonprofits, international organisations, local communities, and individuals are working together to protect and restore population levels, and drive awareness campaigns to engage others in vital conservation work.
In Wisconsin v.

Physical inactivity as a child could result in physical inactivity as an adult.	Screening for obesity is recommended in those over the age of six [ref].
Physical inactivity as a child could result in physical inactivity as an adult.	Researchers studied the physical activity of 133 children over a three-week period using an accelerometer to measure each child's level of physical activity.
Wind power has a negligible effect on global mean surface temperature, and it would deliver enormous global benefits by reducing emissions of CO	Author Ron Prinn cautioned against interpreting the study as an argument against wind power, urging that it be used to guide future research.
Dr. Meyers adds that smoking remains the leading preventable risk factor for heart attack.	The good news is that the beneficial effects of smoking bans appear to be fairly immediate, with declines in reported heart attack cases within 3 months.
They concluded that GM crops had given farmers economic advantages but found no evidence that GM crops had increased yields.	examined 21 published studies of the histopathology of GI tracts of rats that were fed diets derived from GM crops, and identified some systemic flaws in this area of the scientific literature.
Hell will break loose, and more criminals will dare to commit serious crimes.	It will see an escalation of serious crimes in our society, further impairing the nation.
There are different forms where user data in social networks are accessed and updated without a user's permission.	The page falsely claimed that Firsht was homosexual and that he was dishonest.
The use of standardized tests in admissions disproportionately exclude people of color and other marginalized groups.	This uncritical belief in the current system of admissions allows those who have benefited to feel that they earned their position completely on their own.
When a species becomes endangered, it is a sign that the ecosystem is slowly falling apart.	Without healthy forests, grasslands, rivers, oceans and other ecosystems, we will not have clean air, water, or land.
The vegetation clearing and ground disturbance required for wind farms are minimal compared with coal mines and coal-fired power stations.	At the same time, the warming climate which renewable energy schemes seek to mitigate could itself pose an existential threat to peatlands throughout the UK [ref].
Many of those who move to cities find themselves in a worse situation but have lost any moving power they originally had and are thus trapped.	If a family finds themselves faced with starvation, the only chance they have of survival might be to move to another place where they might live another day.
For certain offences in the city-state, the death penalty is mandatory.	The state does not tolerate serious crimes and has prospered despite the criticism it receives from humanitarian groups.
Surrogacy is a popular option for gay men who want to be biologically connected to their children, as well as for lesbian couples who are unable to conceive or carry a pregnancy on their own.	While the surrogacy process is generally no different for same-sex couples and individuals than for any other intended parent, there are some unique considerations to take into account.
Supporters of mandatory gym programs contend that physical education classes have a wide range of benefits.	Even by adding 200 more weekly minutes, the studies showed that boys generally engaged in only 7.5 minutes of more activity per day, while girls only participated in activity 8 additional minutes each week.
By adopting a stern measure like embracing protectionism, a country can be shielded from outside competition and hence local market will grow.	Further, the need to change their behavior so that at no time should they argue that quality of locally manufactured products is inferior to imported products.
The Internet has also gone a step further than television in eroding the advertising income of newspapers, as — unlike broadcast media — it proves a convenient vehicle for classified advertising, particularly in categories such as jobs, vehicles, and real estate.	To survive, newspapers are considering combining and other options [ref], although the outcome of such partnerships has been criticized [ref].
In particular, reality television often shows excessive amounts of aggression; this is needed mostly to keep the audience “on their toes,” making them guess about the outcomes of numerous fomented interpersonal conflicts.	An even more disturbing effect reality shows may have on teenagers is early sexual activity and substance use.
In our local context, there are concerns that the abolition of the death penalty may send the wrong signal that such crimes are not taken seriously enough.	Sparing the lives of hardcore criminals for humanitarian reasons will only cause more misery for others.
The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods for consumers [ref].	This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of real property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric.
Biological diversity has been vital to the development of all types of medicine.	From their role in agricultural production to their contributions to medicine, these animals do far more than many of us realize.
There’s also evidence that marriages that begin on dating apps are less likely to end in the first year, and that the rise of dating apps has correlated with a spike in interracial dating and marriages.	In the most recent Singles in America survey, conducted every February by Match Group and representatives from the Kinsey Institute, 40 percent of the US census-based sample of single people said they’d met someone online in the last year and subsequently had some kind of relationship.

In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled that parents have a fundamental right to direct the education of their children [ref].	The right to homeschool is not frequently questioned in court, but the amount of state regulation and help that can or should be expected continues to be subject to legal debate.
Onshore wind farms are also criticized for their visual impact and impact on the landscape, as typically they need to take up more land than other power stations and need to be built in wild and rural areas, which can lead to industrialization of the countryside, habitat loss, and a drop in tourism.	Critics have linked wind farms to adverse health effects (see wind turbine syndrome).
In Science of Survival, he called for drastic action to be taken, saying that: Such people should be taken from the society as rapidly as possible and uniformly institutionalized; for here is the level of the contagion of immorality, and the destruction of ethics; here is the fodder which secret police organizations use for their filthy operations [ref].	In 2005, the Head Cleric of the Akal Takht condemned same-sex marriages [ref], Hinduism is diverse, with no supreme governing body, but the majority of swamis opposed the idea of religious same-sex marriage in a 2004 survey, and a minority supported them [ref].
The WIPO treaty and several related international agreements underline that the protection of intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining economic growth.	However, in 2013, the UK Intellectual Property Office stated: There are millions of intangible business assets whose value is either not being leveraged at all, or only being leveraged inadvertently [ref].
Public smoking bans seem to be tremendously effective in reducing heart attack and, theoretically, might also help to prevent lung cancer and emphysema, diseases that develop much more slowly than heart attacks.	Even breathing in low doses of cigarette smoke can increase one's risk of heart attack, said David Meyers, M.D., M.P.H., professor of Cardiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine and lead investigator of the study, which is the most comprehensive analysis of related studies to date.
Supporters of anonymity for donors highlight that removing it has significantly reduced donations.	Narelle, whose biological father remains an unknown sperm donor, claimed: “When I look in the mirror, I only see half a person, and that’s difficult to live with.”
Public smoking bans appear to significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks, particularly among younger individuals and nonsmokers, according to a new study published in the September 29, 2009, issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.	According to projections by the authors, a nationwide ban on public smoking could prevent as many as 154,000 heart attacks each year.
They can provide both short- and long-term health benefits.	Some clubs make a small charge for breakfast, providing them free only to those who qualify for free school meals.
The production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide, but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting.	This does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff, but also to the emission of nitrous oxide (NO2) as a fertilizer byproduct, which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (CO2) [ref].
The American tourism industry is dependent on plant and animal species and their ecosystems for their multi-billion dollar, job-intensive industry.	These relatives can be used to ensure crops are disease-resistant while providing information for developing new crops that can grow in less than adequate lands.
In developing countries, urbanisation usually occurs when people move from villages to settle in cities in hope of gaining a better standard of living.	Urbanisation is an increase in the number of people living in towns and cities.
Big data very often means 'dirty data' and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth.	Based on TCS 2013 Global Trend Study, improvements in supply planning and product quality provide the greatest benefit of big data for manufacturing.
He called out the elitism inherent in the question: “Ivy League people think reality TV is kind of lowbrow.” And, dropping a reference to a fascinating-like-a-train-wreck A&E show, he said, “I do think there’s some societal value that we now know all about hoarding.”	Mr. Bagwell, arguing the other side, noted that bad role models on television are not limited to reality shows — there are plenty in scripted TV as well.
These two factors combined generate an explosive mixture, adding up to regular teenage hormonal storms: needless to say, it can make unpredictable adolescent behaviors even more rebellious.	Reality shows are no exception from this rule; it is not uncommon to see sexually-suggestive or explicit content in such reality shows as “Ex on the Beach” or “Big Brother.” At the same time, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, teenage girls viewing such reality shows tend to view physical attractiveness and sexual appeal as criteria for success in real life, or even means of reaching it.
Although it can be considered relatively harmless and many parents enjoy watching such shows together with their kids, there may be negative psychological effects here as well.	And, considering how much time a regular American teenager spends watching television, this fact is alarming.
The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions [ref].	The value of intellectual property is considered similarly high in other developed nations, such as those in the European Union [ref].
When saving endangered species, we are ultimately saving ourselves.	A well-balanced ecosystem purifies the environment, giving us clean air to breathe, a healthy water system to support diverse marine life, and arable land for agricultural production.
Intellectual property (IP) contributes enormously to our national and state economies.	This balance is provided to a large extent by the rules of intellectual property law, which determine the scope of protection according to the subject-matter.
Every Olympics since 1960 has seen major cost overruns [PDF].	L.A.’s success led to a rising number of cities bidding—from two for the 1988 games to twelve for the 2004 games.
A shortage of male recruits forced the military to establish female branches in 1941 and 1942.	Many women wanted to play an active role, and hundreds of voluntary women's auxiliary and paramilitary organisations had been formed by 1940.
It could help couples resolve problems with fertility.	Infertility could become a problem of the past because physicians could take the hereditary portrait of each parent, introduce it into an embryo outside of the body, and conceivably grow the fetus in a laboratory setting.
The exam is considered the pivotal moment for Chinese secondary students as their scores in large [part determine their future – whether they can go to university, which institutions they will be admitted and consequently what careers await them.

The additional time provides an opportunity to increase the learner's ability to process information [ref].	As in a traditional classroom environment, online learners may feel a need to keep the conversation going, so there is a potential for focusing on the quantity of responses over the quality of content within the response [ref].
Among Protestant denominations, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution in 1991 opposing euthanasia and assisted suicide stating that it is morally wrong and unacceptable to take a human life to relieve the suffering caused by incurable illnesses [ref].	Among interpretations of the Koran and Hadith, the early termination of life is a crime, be it by suicide or helping one commit suicide.
The term unschooling as coined by John Holt describes an approach in which parents do not authoritatively direct the child's education, but interact with the child following the child's own interests, leaving them free to explore and learn as their interests lead [ref].	Gatto argues that public education is the primary tool of state-controlled consciousness and serves as a prime illustration of the total institution — a social system which impels obedience to the state and quells free-thinking or dissent [ref].
Research shows that knowledge alone does not have a measurable impact on sexual behaviour.	Teen sexual activity is lowest in two-parent families where the girl has good communication with her mother.
Real-name policy blurs the boundaries between personal information and personal privacy.	But once it matches my true identity, it is personal privacy.
We realize that animals feel pain, and we think that to inflict pain without a reason is bad.	Nothing of practical value is added by dressing up this intuition in the language of philosophy; much is lost when the intuition is made a stage in a logical argument.
In other words, if we choose to defend our personal privacy, then we will oppose the promotion of the real-name system.	When we need to use Internet services, we can only provide personal information.
Jagdish Bhagwati, a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth [ref].	However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.
While online dating sites allows members to search on attributes such as education and income, virtual dating allows users to explore compatibility, sense of humor and rapport.	Not a long time ago, various websites were available on the Internet with access to valuable tips on how to find a partner, and especially focused on how to find women.
Wind farms tend to have much less impact on the environment than many other power stations.	Typically they need to take up more land than other power stations and are more spread out [ref].

Any job that involves repetitive tasks is at risk of being replaced [ref].	Job opportunities will grow with the advent of AI; however, some jobs might be lost because AI would replace them.
Each species that is lost triggers the loss of other species within its ecosystem.	Unfortunately, only about 5% of known plant species have been tested for medicinal uses and there are thousands of plant species that have yet to be identified.
As for technologies DESALINATION which is much more feasible and has almost infinite resource in the form of ocean and RAINWATER HARVESTING which is also much more feasible—with actual application in Singapore, Japan, Germany etc.—and eco-friendly are better alternatives than exploiting Antarctica.	This also negates the Prop.’s later claim “we are not certain about this and if it were to happen it wouldn’t be on the immediate future”.
These testing disparities do not represent students’ potential to learn and achieve.	From academics to policymakers, people mistakenly believe that standardized tests are better at predicting college outcomes, like grades and graduation, than they really are.
Federal courts have also recognized that curfew-imposed restrictions are a violation of First Amendment rights such as free speech and assembly, and therefore have struck down many curfews that fail to give free speech exemptions.	Because curfews increase the likelihood of young people being drawn into the criminal justice system, criminal justice reformers have begun to speak out against the “curfew-to-prison pipeline.” And the penalties for breaking curfew are not trivial.
Intellectual Property Creates and Supports High-Paying Jobs	But whether more innovation, better quality, or more efficient production or distribution actually result depends on many other factors for which neither intellectual property nor competition law should be held responsible.
Through the abundance of information on online dating profiles, as well as elsewhere on the Internet, people may already possess a lot of superficial information about their potential partner's interests before talking to them, which may lead to a false sense of security when meeting up with a new person.	The second highest scoring, Second Life utilizes virtual worlds, message boards, chat groups and profile pages to allow people to contact in a three-dimensional environment.
Wind farms may affect weather in their immediate vicinity.	Whilst turbines installed in water would have a cooling effect, the net impact on global surface temperatures would be an increase of 0.15 °C (0.27 °F).
According to figures gathered by Magic Breakfast, 88% say it has led to improved attendance and attainment, and 93% say it has led to better concentration in class.	It's too busy at my house, says one nine year old.

The use of standardized tests in admissions disproportionately exclude people of color and other marginalized groups.	(Full disclosure: I am affiliated with IGEN and AMIGA, but the opinions here are mine and do not necessarily represent these projects or anyone affiliated with them.)
These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs [ref].	Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – while a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price.
Controlling birth rates allows families to raise the future earnings power of the next generation.	Many empirical studies have tested the quantity-quality trade-off and either observed a negative correlation between family size and child quality or did not find a correlation [ref].
Risk for child safety	Girls in particular are also known to be at more of risk online using social networks than boys.
One local added: ''The public need to realise that handing money to them does them no favours.''	Other residents of the city also expressed doubt about whether those involved in begging were homeless.
Among Protestant denominations, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution in 1991 opposing euthanasia and assisted suicide stating that it is morally wrong and unacceptable to take a human life to relieve the suffering caused by incurable illnesses [ref].

Bullfighter Fernando Roca Rey told La Republica that bullfighting should be seen as a cultural event and that the minister can give her opinion, but that cannot be applied to the whole country.	Peru's newly appointed minister of culture, Susana Baca, said she felt sorry for the animals and that she cried when she once attended a cockfight.
A new study from the National Association for College Admission Counseling provides evidence that test-optional policies ― a variety of policies that allow students not to submit scores on standardized tests like the SAT or GRE during the admissions process ― can help colleges improve their diversity without sacrificing academic quality.	For many practitioners in higher education, these tests are simply the most efficient and common metric for evaluating students.
I usually recommend trying two generic versions before giving up and moving back to a brand name drug because again, the costs are much cheaper.	When they do the blood concentration studies, they do them in “average” people, but because the inactive ingredients and process of manufacturing are different, they can’t assure that everyone will achieve same blood concentrations.
These findings are particularly important in light of mounting evidence that second-hand smoke exposure is nearly as harmful to the heart as chronic active smoking.	“Interestingly, public smoking bans had a stronger effect in reducing heart attacks among women and younger individuals, which may be explained, in part, because younger people tend to frequent clubs, restaurants and bars where smoking is a likely part of the social scene,” said Dr. Meyers.
Public smoking bans seem to be tremendously effective in reducing heart attack and, theoretically, might also help to prevent lung cancer and emphysema, diseases that develop much more slowly than heart attacks.	Secondhand smoke is thought to increase the likelihood of a heart attack by making the blood sticky and more prone to clotting, reducing the amount of good (HDL) cholesterol in the body, and putting individuals at greater risk for dangerous heart rhythms, among other factors.
Given the improvements in delivery methods, online learning environments provide a greater degree of flexibility than traditional classroom settings [ref].

The subsidy cuts are a response to increasing scientific evidence that the total emissions and environmental damage caused during the manufacturing of many clean biofuels often outweighs their lower emissions output, compared with the output of fossil fuels.	But as they aim to be more selective, they are discovering how difficult it can be to figure out whether a particular type of fuel - much less a particular batch of corn ethanol or rapeseed biodiesel - has been produced in an environmentally friendly manner.
Online bullying, also called cyberbullying, is a relatively common occurrence and it can often result in emotional trauma for the victim.	Girls in particular are also known to be at more of risk online using social networks than boys.
In a healthy economic system, demand and supply must coexist for growth to occur; otherwise the economy collapses.	This must also be of excellent quality, of considerate price and be readily available should the consumer have a liking for the product.
Impact studies carried out or commissioned by host governments before the games often argue that hosting the event will provide a major economic lift by creating jobs, drawing tourists, and boosting overall economic output.	Ultimately, there is little evidence for an overall positive economic impact.
Standardized tests put large amounts of pressure on students.	Furthermore, student's success is being tracked to a teacher's relative performance, making teacher advancement contingent upon a teacher's success with a student's academic performance.
Respect for animal welfare is often based on the belief that nonhuman animals are sentient and that consideration should be given to their well-being or suffering, especially when they are under the care of humans [ref].	The predominant view of modern neuroscientists, notwithstanding philosophical problems with the definition of consciousness even in humans, is that consciousness exists in nonhuman animals [ref].
In other words, if we choose to defend our personal privacy, then we will oppose the promotion of the real-name system.	A nation committed to personal freedom must be prepared to mandate privacy protections for its people, whether they eagerly embrace them or not” (2011).
Overall, it can be said that reality shows are not affecting teenagers and children positively.	Or, parents may start putting emotional pressure on their children because of this–and the attempts to adapt to excessively high expectations can have a number of adverse effects on a child (Parent Circle).
physical education is very important to students' health and overall well-being.	The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 required that all school districts with a federally-funded school meal program develop wellness policies that address nutrition and physical activity [ref].
Every Olympics since 1960 has seen major cost overruns [PDF].	The games were growing rapidly, with the number of Summer Olympics participants almost doubling and the number of events increasing by a third during the 1960s.
Alternative energy emerged as a hot topic, and, given the rapid acceleration of technological advancement, the necessity of exploiting Antarctica is doubtful.	1resource exploitation is certainly not “un”evitable, 2“orderly” is not possible, 3it does not prove whether its policy is actually orderly, and 4therefore it fails to establish the link between the motion and its point.
The study, based on information from 37,000 high school students’ responses to surveys from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reveals that most students do not believe gym class is effective.

Mr. Jotwani, though, contended that reality shows have the power to burst stereotypes as well as reinforce them, citing Susan Boyle, the homely singer who became a star after a performance on “Britain’s Got Talent.” “That’s something that only happens on reality TV,” he said.	“Crazy people will do crazy things with or without reality TV,” he said.
Additionally, children may not understand that they are being sold something, and are therefore more impressionable [ref].	Critics claim that food advertisements targeting children are exploitive and are not sufficiently balanced with proper nutritional education to help children understand the consequences of their food choices.
Curfews are ineffective at reducing crime.	In fact, adults commit about 90% of crimes in the U.S. Of course, older people would not tolerate such a strong restriction on their freedom or the targeting of an entire group.
These two factors combined generate an explosive mixture, adding up to regular teenage hormonal storms: needless to say, it can make unpredictable adolescent behaviors even more rebellious.

The computer not only 'sees' the errors but processes the information and learns from what it observes [ref].	Landing.ai, a startup formed by Andrew Ng, developed machine-vision tools that detect microscopic defects in products at resolutions well beyond the human vision.
Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality.	Thus, despite seemingly unequal distribution of income within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.
Rather than employing humans to work in shifts, they could simply invest in AI.	The only cost incurred would be from maintenance after the machinery is purchased and commissioned.
Both intellectual property and competition law enable economic operators to profit by doing better than other economic operators and thereby encourage them to strive to do so, that is to compete.	Properly understood, intellectual property rights restrict competition in some factors (production and distribution) in order to enable and enhance competition in others (innovation and quality).
Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources.	Typically they also need to be built in wild and rural areas, which can lead to industrialization of the countryside [ref] and habitat loss [ref].
